0,"This two-year course in physics is presented from the point of view that you, the reader, are going to be a physicist."
1,"This is not necessarily the case of course, but that is what every professor in every subject assumes!"
2,"If you are going to be a physicist, you will have a lot to study: two hundred years of the most rapidly developing field of knowledge that there is."
3,"So much knowledge, in fact, that you might think that you cannot learn all of it in four years, and truly you cannot; you will have to go to graduate school too!"
4,"Surprisingly enough, in spite of the tremendous amount of work that has been done for all this time it is possible to condense the enormous mass of results to a large extent—that is, to find laws which summarize all our knowledge."
5,"Even so, the laws are so hard to grasp that it is unfair to you to start exploring this tremendous subject without some kind of map or outline of the relationship of one part of the subject of science to another."
6,"Following these preliminary remarks, the first three chapters will therefore outline the relation of physics to the rest of the sciences, the relations of the sciences to each other, and the meaning of science, to help us develop a “feel” for the subject."
7,"You might ask why we cannot teach physics by just giving the basic laws on page one and then showing how they work in all possible circumstances, as we do in Euclidean geometry, where we state the axioms and then make all sorts of deductions."
8,"(So, not satisfied to learn physics in four years, you want to learn it in four minutes?)"
9,We cannot do it in this way for two reasons.
10,"First, we do not yet know all the basic laws: there is an expanding frontier of ignorance."
11,"Second, the correct statement of the laws of physics involves some very unfamiliar ideas which require advanced mathematics for their description."
12,"Therefore, one needs a considerable amount of preparatory training even to learn what the words mean."
13,"No, it is not possible to do it that way."
14,We can only do it piece by piece.
15,"Each piece, or part, of the whole of nature is always merely an approximation to the complete truth, or the complete truth so far as we know it."
16,"In fact, everything we know is only some kind of approximation, because we know that we do not know all the laws as yet."
17,"Therefore, things must be learned only to be unlearned again or, more likely, to be corrected."
18,"The principle of science, the definition, almost, is the following: The test of all knowledge is experiment."
19,Experiment is the sole judge of scientific “truth.” But what is the source of knowledge?
20,Where do the laws that are to be tested come from?
21,"Experiment, itself, helps to produce these laws, in the sense that it gives us hints."
22,"But also needed is imagination to create from these hints the great generalizations—to guess at the wonderful, simple, but very strange patterns beneath them all, and then to experiment to check again whether we have made the right guess."
23,"This imagining process is so difficult that there is a division of labor in physics: there are theoretical physicists who imagine, deduce, and guess at new laws, but do not experiment; and then there are experimental physicists who experiment, imagine, deduce, and guess."
24,"We said that the laws of nature are approximate: that we first find the “wrong” ones, and then we find the “right” ones."
25,"Now, how can an experiment be “wrong”?"
26,"First, in a trivial way: if something is wrong with the apparatus that you did not notice."
27,"But these things are easily fixed, and checked back and forth."
28,"So without snatching at such minor things, how can the results of an experiment be wrong?"
29,Only by being inaccurate.
30,"For example, the mass of an object never seems to change: a spinning top has the same weight as a still one."
31,"So a “law” was invented: mass is constant, independent of speed."
32,That “law” is now found to be incorrect.
33,"Mass is found to increase with velocity, but appreciable increases require velocities near that of light."
34,A true law is: if an object moves with a speed of less than one hundred miles a second the mass is constant to within one part in a million.
35,In some such approximate form this is a correct law.
36,So in practice one might think that the new law makes no significant difference.
37,"Well, yes and no."
38,For ordinary speeds we can certainly forget it and use the simple constant-mass law as a good approximation.
39,"But for high speeds we are wrong, and the higher the speed, the more wrong we are."
40,"Finally, and most interesting, philosophically we are completely wrong with the approximate law."
41,Our entire picture of the world has to be altered even though the mass changes only by a little bit.
42,"This is a very peculiar thing about the philosophy, or the ideas, behind the laws."
43,Even a very small effect sometimes requires profound changes in our ideas.
44,"Now, what should we teach first?"
45,"Should we teach the correct but unfamiliar law with its strange and difficult conceptual ideas, for example the theory of relativity, four-dimensional space-time, and so on?"
46,"Or should we first teach the simple “constant-mass” law, which is only approximate, but does not involve such difficult ideas?"
47,"The first is more exciting, more wonderful, and more fun, but the second is easier to get at first, and is a first step to a real understanding of the first idea."
48,This point arises again and again in teaching physics.
49,"At different times we shall have to resolve it in different ways, but at each stage it is worth learning what is now known, how accurate it is, how it fits into everything else, and how it may be changed when we learn more."
50,"Let us now proceed with our outline, or general map, of our understanding of science today (in particular, physics, but also of other sciences on the periphery), so that when we later concentrate on some particular point we will have some idea of the background, why that particular point is interesting, and how it fits into the big structure."
51,"So, what is our overall picture of the world?"
52,"If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words?"
53,"I believe it is the atomic hypothesis (or the atomic fact, or whatever you wish to call it) that all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another."
54,"In that one sentence, you will see, there is an enormous amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied."
55,"To illustrate the power of the atomic idea, suppose that we have a drop of water a quarter of an inch on the side."
56,"If we look at it very closely we see nothing but water—smooth, continuous water."
57,"Even if we magnify it with the best optical microscope available—roughly two thousand times—then the water drop will be roughly forty feet across, about as big as a large room, and if we looked rather closely, we would still see relatively smooth water—but here and there small football-shaped things swimming back and forth."
58,Very interesting.
59,These are paramecia.
60,"You may stop at this point and get so curious about the paramecia with their wiggling cilia and twisting bodies that you go no further, except perhaps to magnify the paramecia still more and see inside."
61,"This, of course, is a subject for biology, but for the present we pass on and look still more closely at the water material itself, magnifying it two thousand times again."
62,"Now the drop of water extends about fifteen miles across, and if we look very closely at it we see a kind of teeming, something which no longer has a smooth appearance—it looks something like a crowd at a football game as seen from a very great distance."
63,"In order to see what this teeming is about, we will magnify it another two hundred and fifty times and we will see something similar to what is shown in Fig."
64,1–1.
65,"This is a picture of water magnified a billion times, but idealized in several ways."
66,"In the first place, the particles are drawn in a simple manner with sharp edges, which is inaccurate."
67,"Secondly, for simplicity, they are sketched almost schematically in a two-dimensional arrangement, but of course they are moving around in three dimensions."
68,"Notice that there are two kinds of “blobs” or circles to represent the atoms of oxygen (black) and hydrogen (white), and that each oxygen has two hydrogens tied to it."
69,(Each little group of an oxygen with its two hydrogens is called a molecule.)
70,"The picture is idealized further in that the real particles in nature are continually jiggling and bouncing, turning and twisting around one another."
71,You will have to imagine this as a dynamic rather than a static picture.
72,"Another thing that cannot be illustrated in a drawing is the fact that the particles are “stuck together”—that they attract each other, this one pulled by that one, etc."
73,"The whole group is “glued together,” so to speak."
74,"On the other hand, the particles do not squeeze through each other."
75,"If you try to squeeze two of them too close together, they repel."
76,"Another way to remember their size is this: if an apple is magnified to the size of the earth, then the atoms in the apple are approximately the size of the original apple."
77,Now imagine this great drop of water with all of these jiggling particles stuck together and tagging along with each other.
78,"The water keeps its volume; it does not fall apart, because of the attraction of the molecules for each other."
79,"If the drop is on a slope, where it can move from one place to another, the water will flow, but it does not just disappear—things do not just fly apart—because of the molecular attraction."
80,"Now the jiggling motion is what we represent as heat: when we increase the temperature, we increase the motion."
81,"If we heat the water, the jiggling increases and the volume between the atoms increases, and if the heating continues there comes a time when the pull between the molecules is not enough to hold them together and they do fly apart and become separated from one another."
82,"Of course, this is how we manufacture steam out of water—by increasing the temperature; the particles fly apart because of the increased motion."
83,In Fig.
84,1–2 we have a picture of steam.
85,This picture of steam fails in one respect: at ordinary atmospheric pressure there certainly would not be as many as three water molecules in this figure.
86,Most squares this size would contain none—but we accidentally have two and a half or three in the picture (just so it would not be completely blank).
87,Now in the case of steam we see the characteristic molecules more clearly than in the case of water.
88,Let us see what some of the properties of steam vapor or any other gas are.
89,"The molecules, being separated from one another, will bounce against the walls."
90,Imagine a room with a number of tennis balls (a hundred or so) bouncing around in perpetual motion.
91,"When they bombard the wall, this pushes the wall away."
92,(Of course we would have to push the wall back.)
93,This means that the gas exerts a jittery force which our coarse senses (not being ourselves magnified a billion times) feel only as an average push.
94,In order to confine a gas we must apply a pressure.
95,"Figure 1–3 shows a standard vessel for holding gases (used in all textbooks), a cylinder with a piston in it."
96,"Now, it makes no difference what the shapes of water molecules are, so for simplicity we shall draw them as tennis balls or little dots."
97,These things are in perpetual motion in all directions.
98,"So many of them are hitting the top piston all the time that to keep it from being patiently knocked out of the tank by this continuous banging, we shall have to hold the piston down by a certain force, which we call the pressure (really, the pressure times the area is the force)."
99,"Clearly, the force is proportional to the area, for if we increase the area but keep the number of molecules per cubic centimeter the same, we increase the number of collisions with the piston in the same proportion as the area was increased."
100,"Now let us put twice as many molecules in this tank, so as to double the density, and let them have the same speed, i.e., the same temperature."
101,"Then, to a close approximation, the number of collisions will be doubled, and since each will be just as “energetic” as before, the pressure is proportional to the density."
102,"If we consider the true nature of the forces between the atoms, we would expect a slight decrease in pressure because of the attraction between the atoms, and a slight increase because of the finite volume they occupy."
103,"Nevertheless, to an excellent approximation, if the density is low enough that there are not many atoms, the pressure is proportional to the density."
104,"We can also see something else: If we increase the temperature without changing the density of the gas, i.e., if we increase the speed of the atoms, what is going to happen to the pressure?"
105,"Well, the atoms hit harder because they are moving faster, and in addition they hit more often, so the pressure increases."
106,You see how simple the ideas of atomic theory are.
107,Let us consider another situation.
108,"Suppose that the piston moves inward, so that the atoms are slowly compressed into a smaller space."
109,What happens when an atom hits the moving piston?
110,Evidently it picks up speed from the collision.
111,"You can try it by bouncing a ping-pong ball from a forward-moving paddle, for example, and you will find that it comes off with more speed than that with which it struck."
112,"(Special example: if an atom happens to be standing still and the piston hits it, it will certainly move.)"
113,So the atoms are “hotter” when they come away from the piston than they were before they struck it.
114,Therefore all the atoms which are in the vessel will have picked up speed.
115,"This means that when we compress a gas slowly, the temperature of the gas increases."
116,"So, under slow compression, a gas will increase in temperature, and under slow expansion it will decrease in temperature."
117,We now return to our drop of water and look in another direction.
118,Suppose that we decrease the temperature of our drop of water.
119,Suppose that the jiggling of the molecules of the atoms in the water is steadily decreasing.
120,"We know that there are forces of attraction between the atoms, so that after a while they will not be able to jiggle so well."
121,What will happen at very low temperatures is indicated in Fig.
122,1–4: the molecules lock into a new pattern which is ice.
123,"This particular schematic diagram of ice is wrong because it is in two dimensions, but it is right qualitatively."
124,"The interesting point is that the material has a definite place for every atom, and you can easily appreciate that if somehow or other we were to hold all the atoms at one end of the drop in a certain arrangement, each atom in a certain place, then because of the structure of interconnections, which is rigid, the other end miles away (at our magnified scale) will have a definite location."
125,"So if we hold a needle of ice at one end, the other end resists our pushing it aside, unlike the case of water, in which the structure is broken down because of the increased jiggling so that the atoms all move around in different ways."
126,"The difference between solids and liquids is, then, that in a solid the atoms are arranged in some kind of an array, called a crystalline array, and they do not have a random position at long distances; the position of the atoms on one side of the crystal is determined by that of other atoms millions of atoms away on the other side of the crystal."
127,"Figure 1–4 is an invented arrangement for ice, and although it contains many of the correct features of ice, it is not the true arrangement."
128,One of the correct features is that there is a part of the symmetry that is hexagonal.
129,So there is a symmetry in the ice which accounts for the six-sided appearance of snowflakes.
130,Another thing we can see from Fig.
131,1–4 is why ice shrinks when it melts.
132,"The particular crystal pattern of ice shown here has many “holes” in it, as does the true ice structure."
133,"When the organization breaks down, these holes can be occupied by molecules."
134,"Most simple substances, with the exception of water and type metal, expand upon melting, because the atoms are closely packed in the solid crystal and upon melting need more room to jiggle around, but an open structure collapses, as in the case of water."
135,"Now although ice has a “rigid” crystalline form, its temperature can change—ice has heat."
136,"If we wish, we can change the amount of heat."
137,What is the heat in the case of ice?
138,The atoms are not standing still.
139,They are jiggling and vibrating.
140,"So even though there is a definite order to the crystal—a definite structure—all of the atoms are vibrating “in place.” As we increase the temperature, they vibrate with greater and greater amplitude, until they shake themselves out of place."
141,We call this melting.
142,"As we decrease the temperature, the vibration decreases and decreases until, at absolute zero, there is a minimum amount of vibration that the atoms can have, but not zero."
143,"This minimum amount of motion that atoms can have is not enough to melt a substance, with one exception: helium."
144,"Helium merely decreases the atomic motions as much as it can, but even at absolute zero there is still enough motion to keep it from freezing."
145,"Helium, even at absolute zero, does not freeze, unless the pressure is made so great as to make the atoms squash together."
146,"If we increase the pressure, we can make it solidify."
147,"So much for the description of solids, liquids, and gases from the atomic point of view."
148,"However, the atomic hypothesis also describes processes, and so we shall now look at a number of processes from an atomic standpoint."
149,The first process that we shall look at is associated with the surface of the water.
150,What happens at the surface of the water?
151,We shall now make the picture more complicated—and more realistic—by imagining that the surface is in air.
152,Figure 1–5 shows the surface of water in air.
153,"We see the water molecules as before, forming a body of liquid water, but now we also see the surface of the water."
154,"Above the surface we find a number of things: First of all there are water molecules, as in steam."
155,"This is water vapor, which is always found above liquid water."
156,(There is an equilibrium between the steam vapor and the water which will be described later.)
157,"In addition we find some other molecules—here two oxygen atoms stuck together by themselves, forming an oxygen molecule, there two nitrogen atoms also stuck together to make a nitrogen molecule."
158,"Air consists almost entirely of nitrogen, oxygen, some water vapor, and lesser amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, and other things."
159,"So above the water surface is the air, a gas, containing some water vapor."
160,Now what is happening in this picture?
161,The molecules in the water are always jiggling around.
162,"From time to time, one on the surface happens to be hit a little harder than usual, and gets knocked away."
163,It is hard to see that happening in the picture because it is a still picture.
164,"But we can imagine that one molecule near the surface has just been hit and is flying out, or perhaps another one has been hit and is flying out."
165,"Thus, molecule by molecule, the water disappears—it evaporates."
166,"But if we close the vessel above, after a while we shall find a large number of molecules of water amongst the air molecules."
167,"From time to time, one of these vapor molecules comes flying down to the water and gets stuck again."
168,"So we see that what looks like a dead, uninteresting thing—a glass of water with a cover, that has been sitting there for perhaps twenty years—really contains a dynamic and interesting phenomenon which is going on all the time."
169,"To our eyes, our crude eyes, nothing is changing, but if we could see it a billion times magnified, we would see that from its own point of view it is always changing: molecules are leaving the surface, molecules are coming back."
170,Why do we see no change?
171,Because just as many molecules are leaving as are coming back!
172,"In the long run “nothing happens.” If we then take the top of the vessel off and blow the moist air away, replacing it with dry air, then the number of molecules leaving is just the same as it was before, because this depends on the jiggling of the water, but the number coming back is greatly reduced because there are so many fewer water molecules above the water."
173,"Therefore there are more going out than coming in, and the water evaporates."
174,"Hence, if you wish to evaporate water turn on the fan!"
175,Here is something else: Which molecules leave?
176,"When a molecule leaves it is due to an accidental, extra accumulation of a little bit more than ordinary energy, which it needs if it is to break away from the attractions of its neighbors."
177,"Therefore, since those that leave have more energy than the average, the ones that are left have less average motion than they had before."
178,So the liquid gradually cools if it evaporates.
179,"Of course, when a molecule of vapor comes from the air to the water below there is a sudden great attraction as the molecule approaches the surface."
180,This speeds up the incoming molecule and results in generation of heat.
181,So when they leave they take away heat; when they come back they generate heat.
182,Of course when there is no net evaporation the result is nothing—the water is not changing temperature.
183,"If we blow on the water so as to maintain a continuous preponderance in the number evaporating, then the water is cooled."
184,"Hence, blow on soup to cool it!"
185,Of course you should realize that the processes just described are more complicated than we have indicated.
186,"Not only does the water go into the air, but also, from time to time, one of the oxygen or nitrogen molecules will come in and “get lost” in the mass of water molecules, and work its way into the water."
187,Thus the air dissolves in the water; oxygen and nitrogen molecules will work their way into the water and the water will contain air.
188,"If we suddenly take the air away from the vessel, then the air molecules will leave more rapidly than they come in, and in doing so will make bubbles."
189,"This is very bad for divers, as you may know."
190,Now we go on to another process.
191,In Fig.
192,"1–6 we see, from an atomic point of view, a solid dissolving in water."
193,"If we put a crystal of salt in the water, what will happen?"
194,"Salt is a solid, a crystal, an organized arrangement of “salt atoms.” Figure 1–7 is an illustration of the three-dimensional structure of common salt, sodium chloride."
195,"Strictly speaking, the crystal is not made of atoms, but of what we call ions."
196,An ion is an atom which either has a few extra electrons or has lost a few electrons.
197,In a salt crystal we find chlorine ions (chlorine atoms with an extra electron) and sodium ions (sodium atoms with one electron missing).
198,"The ions all stick together by electrical attraction in the solid salt, but when we put them in the water we find, because of the attractions of the negative oxygen and positive hydrogen for the ions, that some of the ions jiggle loose."
199,In Fig.
200,"1–6 we see a chlorine ion getting loose, and other atoms floating in the water in the form of ions."
201,This picture was made with some care.
202,"Notice, for example, that the hydrogen ends of the water molecules are more likely to be near the chlorine ion, while near the sodium ion we are more likely to find the oxygen end, because the sodium is positive and the oxygen end of the water is negative, and they attract electrically."
203,Can we tell from this picture whether the salt is dissolving in water or crystallizing out of water?
204,"Of course we cannot tell, because while some of the atoms are leaving the crystal other atoms are rejoining it."
205,"The process is a dynamic one, just as in the case of evaporation, and it depends on whether there is more or less salt in the water than the amount needed for equilibrium."
206,By equilibrium we mean that situation in which the rate at which atoms are leaving just matches the rate at which they are coming back.
207,"If there is almost no salt in the water, more atoms leave than return, and the salt dissolves."
208,"If, on the other hand, there are too many “salt atoms,” more return than leave, and the salt is crystallizing."
209,"In passing, we mention that the concept of a molecule of a substance is only approximate and exists only for a certain class of substances."
210,It is clear in the case of water that the three atoms are actually stuck together.
211,It is not so clear in the case of sodium chloride in the solid.
212,There is just an arrangement of sodium and chlorine ions in a cubic pattern.
213,There is no natural way to group them as “molecules of salt.”
214,"Returning to our discussion of solution and precipitation, if we increase the temperature of the salt solution, then the rate at which atoms are taken away is increased, and so is the rate at which atoms are brought back."
215,"It turns out to be very difficult, in general, to predict which way it is going to go, whether more or less of the solid will dissolve."
216,"Most substances dissolve more, but some substances dissolve less, as the temperature increases."
217,"In all of the processes which have been described so far, the atoms and the ions have not changed partners, but of course there are circumstances in which the atoms do change combinations, forming new molecules."
218,This is illustrated in Fig.
219,1–8.
220,A process in which the rearrangement of the atomic partners occurs is what we call a chemical reaction.
221,"The other processes so far described are called physical processes, but there is no sharp distinction between the two."
222,"(Nature does not care what we call it, she just keeps on doing it.)"
223,This figure is supposed to represent carbon burning in oxygen.
224,"In the case of oxygen, two oxygen atoms stick together very strongly."
225,(Why do not three or even four stick together?
226,That is one of the very peculiar characteristics of such atomic processes.
227,"Atoms are very special: they like certain particular partners, certain particular directions, and so on."
228,It is the job of physics to analyze why each one wants what it wants.
229,"At any rate, two oxygen atoms form, saturated and happy, a molecule.)"
230,The carbon atoms are supposed to be in a solid crystal (which could be graphite or diamond1).
231,"Now, for example, one of the oxygen molecules can come over to the carbon, and each atom can pick up a carbon atom and go flying off in a new combination—“carbon-oxygen”—which is a molecule of the gas called carbon monoxide."
232,It is given the chemical name CO.
233,It is very simple: the letters “CO” are practically a picture of that molecule.
234,But carbon attracts oxygen much more than oxygen attracts oxygen or carbon attracts carbon.
235,"Therefore in this process the oxygen may arrive with only a little energy, but the oxygen and carbon will snap together with a tremendous vengeance and commotion, and everything near them will pick up the energy."
236,"A large amount of motion energy, kinetic energy, is thus generated."
237,This of course is burning; we are getting heat from the combination of oxygen and carbon.
238,"The heat is ordinarily in the form of the molecular motion of the hot gas, but in certain circumstances it can be so enormous that it generates light."
239,That is how one gets flames.
240,"In addition, the carbon monoxide is not quite satisfied."
241,"It is possible for it to attach another oxygen, so that we might have a much more complicated reaction in which the oxygen is combining with the carbon, while at the same time there happens to be a collision with a carbon monoxide molecule."
242,"If we burn the carbon with very little oxygen in a very rapid reaction (for example, in an automobile engine, where the explosion is so fast that there is not time for it to make carbon dioxide) a considerable amount of carbon monoxide is formed."
243,"In many such rearrangements, a very large amount of energy is released, forming explosions, flames, etc., depending on the reactions."
244,"Chemists have studied these arrangements of the atoms, and found that every substance is some type of arrangement of atoms."
245,"To illustrate this idea, let us consider another example."
246,"If we go into a field of small violets, we know what “that smell” is."
247,"It is some kind of molecule, or arrangement of atoms, that has worked its way into our noses."
248,"First of all, how did it work its way in?"
249,That is rather easy.
250,"If the smell is some kind of molecule in the air, jiggling around and being knocked every which way, it might have accidentally worked its way into the nose."
251,Certainly it has no particular desire to get into our nose.
252,"It is merely one helpless part of a jostling crowd of molecules, and in its aimless wanderings this particular chunk of matter happens to find itself in the nose."
253,"Now chemists can take special molecules like the odor of violets, and analyze them and tell us the exact arrangement of the atoms in space."
254,We know that the carbon dioxide molecule is straight and symmetrical: O—C—O.
255,"(That can be determined easily, too, by physical methods.)"
256,"However, even for the vastly more complicated arrangements of atoms that there are in chemistry, one can, by a long, remarkable process of detective work, find the arrangements of the atoms."
257,"Figure 1–9 is a picture of the air in the neighborhood of a violet; again we find nitrogen and oxygen in the air, and water vapor."
258,(Why is there water vapor?
259,Because the violet is wet.
260,All plants transpire.)
261,"However, we also see a “monster” composed of carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms, and oxygen atoms, which have picked a certain particular pattern in which to be arranged."
262,"It is a much more complicated arrangement than that of carbon dioxide; in fact, it is an enormously complicated arrangement."
263,"Unfortunately, we cannot picture all that is really known about it chemically, because the precise arrangement of all the atoms is actually known in three dimensions, while our picture is in only two dimensions."
264,"The six carbons which form a ring do not form a flat ring, but a kind of “puckered” ring."
265,All of the angles and distances are known.
266,So a chemical formula is merely a picture of such a molecule.
267,"When the chemist writes such a thing on the blackboard, he is trying to “draw,” roughly speaking, in two dimensions."
268,"For example, we see a “ring” of six carbons, and a “chain” of carbons hanging on the end, with an oxygen second from the end, three hydrogens tied to that carbon, two carbons and three hydrogens sticking up here, etc."
269,How does the chemist find what the arrangement is?
270,"He mixes bottles full of stuff together, and if it turns red, it tells him that it consists of one hydrogen and two carbons tied on here; if it turns blue, on the other hand, that is not the way it is at all."
271,This is one of the most fantastic pieces of detective work that has ever been done—organic chemistry.
272,To discover the arrangement of the atoms in these enormously complicated arrays the chemist looks at what happens when he mixes two different substances together.
273,The physicist could never quite believe that the chemist knew what he was talking about when he described the arrangement of the atoms.
274,"For about twenty years it has been possible, in some cases, to look at such molecules (not quite as complicated as this one, but some which contain parts of it) by a physical method, and it has been possible to locate every atom, not by looking at colors, but by measuring where they are."
275,"And lo and behold!, the chemists are almost always correct."
276,"It turns out, in fact, that in the odor of violets there are three slightly different molecules, which differ only in the arrangement of the hydrogen atoms."
277,"One problem of chemistry is to name a substance, so that we will know what it is."
278,Find a name for this shape!
279,"Not only must the name tell the shape, but it must also tell that here is an oxygen atom, there a hydrogen—exactly what and where each atom is."
280,So we can appreciate that the chemical names must be complex in order to be complete.
281,"You see that the name of this thing in the more complete form that will tell you the structure of it is 4-(2, 2, 3, 6 tetramethyl-5-cyclohexenyl)-3-buten-2-one, and that tells you that this is the arrangement."
282,"We can appreciate the difficulties that the chemists have, and also appreciate the reason for such long names."
283,"It is not that they wish to be obscure, but they have an extremely difficult problem in trying to describe the molecules in words!"
284,How do we know that there are atoms?
285,"By one of the tricks mentioned earlier: we make the hypothesis that there are atoms, and one after the other results come out the way we predict, as they ought to if things are made of atoms."
286,"There is also somewhat more direct evidence, a good example of which is the following: The atoms are so small that you cannot see them with a light microscope—in fact, not even with an electron microscope."
287,(With a light microscope you can only see things which are much bigger.)
288,"Now if the atoms are always in motion, say in water, and we put a big ball of something in the water, a ball much bigger than the atoms, the ball will jiggle around—much as in a push ball game, where a great big ball is pushed around by a lot of people."
289,"The people are pushing in various directions, and the ball moves around the field in an irregular fashion."
290,"So, in the same way, the “large ball” will move because of the inequalities of the collisions on one side to the other, from one moment to the next."
291,"Therefore, if we look at very tiny particles (colloids) in water through an excellent microscope, we see a perpetual jiggling of the particles, which is the result of the bombardment of the atoms."
292,This is called the Brownian motion.
293,We can see further evidence for atoms in the structure of crystals.
294,In many cases the structures deduced by x-ray analysis agree in their spatial “shapes” with the forms actually exhibited by crystals as they occur in nature.
295,"The angles between the various “faces” of a crystal agree, within seconds of arc, with angles deduced on the assumption that a crystal is made of many “layers” of atoms."
296,Everything is made of atoms.
297,That is the key hypothesis.
298,"The most important hypothesis in all of biology, for example, is that everything that animals do, atoms do."
299,"In other words, there is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics."
300,"This was not known from the beginning: it took some experimenting and theorizing to suggest this hypothesis, but now it is accepted, and it is the most useful theory for producing new ideas in the field of biology."
301,"If a piece of steel or a piece of salt, consisting of atoms one next to the other, can have such interesting properties; if water—which is nothing but these little blobs, mile upon mile of the same thing over the earth—can form waves and foam, and make rushing noises and strange patterns as it runs over cement; if all of this, all the life of a stream of water, can be nothing but a pile of atoms, how much more is possible?"
302,"If instead of arranging the atoms in some definite pattern, again and again repeated, on and on, or even forming little lumps of complexity like the odor of violets, we make an arrangement which is always different from place to place, with different kinds of atoms arranged in many ways, continually changing, not repeating, how much more marvelously is it possible that this thing might behave?"
303,"Is it possible that that “thing” walking back and forth in front of you, talking to you, is a great glob of these atoms in a very complex arrangement, such that the sheer complexity of it staggers the imagination as to what it can do?"
304,"When we say we are a pile of atoms, we do not mean we are merely a pile of atoms, because a pile of atoms which is not repeated from one to the other might well have the possibilities which you see before you in the mirror."
305,"In this chapter, we shall examine the most fundamental ideas that we have about physics—the nature of things as we see them at the present time."
306,We shall not discuss the history of how we know that all these ideas are true; you will learn these details in due time.
307,"The things with which we concern ourselves in science appear in myriad forms, and with a multitude of attributes."
308,"For example, if we stand on the shore and look at the sea, we see the water, the waves breaking, the foam, the sloshing motion of the water, the sound, the air, the winds and the clouds, the sun and the blue sky, and light; there is sand and there are rocks of various hardness and permanence, color and texture."
309,"There are animals and seaweed, hunger and disease, and the observer on the beach; there may be even happiness and thought."
310,Any other spot in nature has a similar variety of things and influences.
311,"It is always as complicated as that, no matter where it is."
312,"Curiosity demands that we ask questions, that we try to put things together and try to understand this multitude of aspects as perhaps resulting from the action of a relatively small number of elemental things and forces acting in an infinite variety of combinations."
313,For example: Is the sand other than the rocks?
314,"That is, is the sand perhaps nothing but a great number of very tiny stones?"
315,Is the moon a great rock?
316,"If we understood rocks, would we also understand the sand and the moon?"
317,Is the wind a sloshing of the air analogous to the sloshing motion of the water in the sea?
318,What common features do different movements have?
319,What is common to different kinds of sound?
320,How many different colors are there?
321,And so on.
322,"In this way we try gradually to analyze all things, to put together things which at first sight look different, with the hope that we may be able to reduce the number of different things and thereby understand them better."
323,"A few hundred years ago, a method was devised to find partial answers to such questions."
324,"Observation, reason, and experiment make up what we call the scientific method."
325,"We shall have to limit ourselves to a bare description of our basic view of what is sometimes called fundamental physics, or fundamental ideas which have arisen from the application of the scientific method."
326,What do we mean by “understanding” something?
327,"We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game."
328,We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing.
329,"Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules."
330,The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics.
331,"Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited."
332,"If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does."
333,"So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to find all the rules."
334,"Actually, we do not have all the rules now."
335,(Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.)
336,"Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next."
337,"We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game."
338,"If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world."
339,How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well?
340,"There are, roughly speaking, three ways."
341,"First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work."
342,"(In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we can figure out exactly.)"
343,A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them.
344,"For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal."
345,"One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square."
346,"So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square."
347,"Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square)."
348,That is the way it is in physics.
349,"For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule."
350,"From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work—not the places where they do work!"
351,That is the way in which we discover new rules.
352,The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all.
353,"That is, by rough approximation."
354,"While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances."
355,"In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."
356,"At first the phenomena of nature were roughly divided into classes, like heat, electricity, mechanics, magnetism, properties of substances, chemical phenomena, light or optics, x-rays, nuclear physics, gravitation, meson phenomena, etc."
357,"However, the aim is to see complete nature as different aspects of one set of phenomena."
358,"That is the problem in basic theoretical physics, today—to find the laws behind experiment; to amalgamate these classes."
359,"Historically, we have always been able to amalgamate them, but as time goes on new things are found."
360,"We were amalgamating very well, when all of a sudden x-rays were found."
361,"Then we amalgamated some more, and mesons were found."
362,"Therefore, at any stage of the game, it always looks rather messy."
363,"A great deal is amalgamated, but there are always many wires or threads hanging out in all directions."
364,"That is the situation today, which we shall try to describe."
365,Some historic examples of amalgamation are the following.
366,"First, take heat and mechanics."
367,"When atoms are in motion, the more motion, the more heat the system contains, and so heat and all temperature effects can be represented by the laws of mechanics."
368,"Another tremendous amalgamation was the discovery of the relation between electricity, magnetism, and light, which were found to be different aspects of the same thing, which we call today the electromagnetic field."
369,"Another amalgamation is the unification of chemical phenomena, the various properties of various substances, and the behavior of atomic particles, which is in the quantum mechanics of chemistry."
370,"The question is, of course, is it going to be possible to amalgamate everything, and merely discover that this world represents different aspects of one thing?"
371,Nobody knows.
372,"All we know is that as we go along, we find that we can amalgamate pieces, and then we find some pieces that do not fit, and we keep trying to put the jigsaw puzzle together."
373,"Whether there are a finite number of pieces, and whether there is even a border to the puzzle, is of course unknown."
374,"It will never be known until we finish the picture, if ever."
375,"What we wish to do here is to see to what extent this amalgamation process has gone on, and what the situation is at present, in understanding basic phenomena in terms of the smallest set of principles."
376,"To express it in a simple manner, what are things made of and how few elements are there?"
377,"It is a little difficult to begin at once with the present view, so we shall first see how things looked in about 1920 and then take a few things out of that picture."
378,"Before 1920, our world picture was something like this: The “stage” on which the universe goes is the three-dimensional space of geometry, as described by Euclid, and things change in a medium called time."
379,"The elements on the stage are particles, for example the atoms, which have some properties."
380,"First, the property of inertia: if a particle is moving it keeps on going in the same direction unless forces act upon it."
381,"The second element, then, is forces, which were then thought to be of two varieties: First, an enormously complicated, detailed kind of interaction force which held the various atoms in different combinations in a complicated way, which determined whether salt would dissolve faster or slower when we raise the temperature."
382,"The other force that was known was a long-range interaction—a smooth and quiet attraction—which varied inversely as the square of the distance, and was called gravitation."
383,This law was known and was very simple.
384,"Why things remain in motion when they are moving, or why there is a law of gravitation was, of course, not known."
385,A description of nature is what we are concerned with here.
386,"From this point of view, then, a gas, and indeed all matter, is a myriad of moving particles."
387,Thus many of the things we saw while standing at the seashore can immediately be connected.
388,"First the pressure: this comes from the collisions of the atoms with the walls or whatever; the drift of the atoms, if they are all moving in one direction on the average, is wind; the random internal motions are the heat."
389,"There are waves of excess density, where too many particles have collected, and so as they rush off they push up piles of particles farther out, and so on."
390,This wave of excess density is sound.
391,It is a tremendous achievement to be able to understand so much.
392,Some of these things were described in the previous chapter.
393,What kinds of particles are there?
394,They had different names associated with their chemical properties.
395,"The next part of the problem was, what are the short-range forces?"
396,"Why does carbon attract one oxygen or perhaps two oxygens, but not three oxygens?"
397,What is the machinery of interaction between atoms?
398,Is it gravitation?
399,The answer is no.
400,Gravity is entirely too weak.
401,"But imagine a force analogous to gravity, varying inversely with the square of the distance, but enormously more powerful and having one difference."
402,"In gravity everything attracts everything else, but now imagine that there are two kinds of “things,” and that this new force (which is the electrical force, of course) has the property that likes repel but unlikes attract."
403,The “thing” that carries this strong interaction is called charge.
404,Then what do we have?
405,"Suppose that we have two unlikes that attract each other, a plus and a minus, and that they stick very close together."
406,Suppose we have another charge some distance away.
407,Would it feel any attraction?
408,"It would feel practically none, because if the first two are equal in size, the attraction for the one and the repulsion for the other balance out."
409,Therefore there is very little force at any appreciable distance.
410,"On the other hand, if we get very close with the extra charge, attraction arises, because the repulsion of likes and attraction of unlikes will tend to bring unlikes closer together and push likes farther apart."
411,Then the repulsion will be less than the attraction.
412,"This is the reason why the atoms, which are constituted out of plus and minus electric charges, feel very little force when they are separated by appreciable distance (aside from gravity)."
413,"When they come close together, they can “see inside” each other and rearrange their charges, with the result that they have a very strong interaction."
414,The ultimate basis of an interaction between the atoms is electrical.
415,"Since this force is so enormous, all the plusses and all minuses will normally come together in as intimate a combination as they can."
416,"All things, even ourselves, are made of fine-grained, enormously strongly interacting plus and minus parts, all neatly balanced out."
417,"Once in a while, by accident, we may rub off a few minuses or a few plusses (usually it is easier to rub off minuses), and in those circumstances we find the force of electricity unbalanced, and we can then see the effects of these electrical attractions."
418,"To give an idea of how much stronger electricity is than gravitation, consider two grains of sand, a millimeter across, thirty meters apart."
419,"If the force between them were not balanced, if everything attracted everything else instead of likes repelling, so that there were no cancellation, how much force would there be?"
420,There would be a force of three million tons between the two!
421,"You see, there is very, very little excess or deficit of the number of negative or positive charges necessary to produce appreciable electrical effects."
422,"This is, of course, the reason why you cannot see the difference between an electrically charged or uncharged thing—so few particles are involved that they hardly make a difference in the weight or size of an object."
423,With this picture the atoms were easier to understand.
424,"They were thought to have a “nucleus” at the center, which is positively electrically charged and very massive, and the nucleus is surrounded by a certain number of “electrons” which are very light and negatively charged."
425,"Now we go a little ahead in our story to remark that in the nucleus itself there were found two kinds of particles, protons and neutrons, almost of the same weight and very heavy."
426,The protons are electrically charged and the neutrons are neutral.
427,"If we have an atom with six protons inside its nucleus, and this is surrounded by six electrons (the negative particles in the ordinary world of matter are all electrons, and these are very light compared with the protons and neutrons which make nuclei), this would be atom number six in the chemical table, and it is called carbon."
428,"Atom number eight is called oxygen, etc., because the chemical properties depend upon the electrons on the outside, and in fact only upon how many electrons there are."
429,"So the chemical properties of a substance depend only on a number, the number of electrons."
430,"Instead of saying “carbon,” we could say “element six,” meaning six electrons, but of course, when the elements were first discovered, it was not known that they could be numbered that way, and secondly, it would make everything look rather complicated."
431,"It is better to have names and symbols for these things, rather than to call everything by number.)"
432,More was discovered about the electrical force.
433,The natural interpretation of electrical interaction is that two objects simply attract each other: plus against minus.
434,"However, this was discovered to be an inadequate idea to represent it."
435,"A more adequate representation of the situation is to say that the existence of the positive charge, in some sense, distorts, or creates a “condition” in space, so that when we put the negative charge in, it feels a force."
436,This potentiality for producing a force is called an electric field.
437,"When we put an electron in an electric field, we say it is “pulled.” We then have two rules: (a) charges make a field, and (b) charges in fields have forces on them and move."
438,"The reason for this will become clear when we discuss the following phenomena: If we were to charge a body, say a comb, electrically, and then place a charged piece of paper at a distance and move the comb back and forth, the paper will respond by always pointing to the comb."
439,"If we shake it faster, it will be discovered that the paper is a little behind, there is a delay in the action."
440,"(At the first stage, when we move the comb rather slowly, we find a complication which is magnetism."
441,"Magnetic influences have to do with charges in relative motion, so magnetic forces and electric forces can really be attributed to one field, as two different aspects of exactly the same thing."
442,A changing electric field cannot exist without magnetism.)
443,"If we move the charged paper farther out, the delay is greater."
444,Then an interesting thing is observed.
445,"Although the forces between two charged objects should go inversely as the square of the distance, it is found, when we shake a charge, that the influence extends very much farther out than we would guess at first sight."
446,"That is, the effect falls off more slowly than the inverse square."
447,"Here is an analogy: If we are in a pool of water and there is a floating cork very close by, we can move it “directly” by pushing the water with another cork."
448,"If you looked only at the two corks, all you would see would be that one moved immediately in response to the motion of the other—there is some kind of “interaction” between them."
449,"Of course, what we really do is to disturb the water; the water then disturbs the other cork."
450,"We could make up a “law” that if you pushed the water a little bit, an object close by in the water would move."
451,"If it were farther away, of course, the second cork would scarcely move, for we move the water locally."
452,"On the other hand, if we jiggle the cork a new phenomenon is involved, in which the motion of the water moves the water there, etc., and waves travel away, so that by jiggling, there is an influence very much farther out, an oscillatory influence, that cannot be understood from the direct interaction."
453,"Therefore the idea of direct interaction must be replaced with the existence of the water, or in the electrical case, with what we call the electromagnetic field."
454,"The electromagnetic field can carry waves; some of these waves are light, others are used in radio broadcasts, but the general name is electromagnetic waves."
455,These oscillatory waves can have various frequencies.
456,The only thing that is really different from one wave to another is the frequency of oscillation.
457,"If we shake a charge back and forth more and more rapidly, and look at the effects, we get a whole series of different kinds of effects, which are all unified by specifying but one number, the number of oscillations per second."
458,The usual “pickup” that we get from electric currents in the circuits in the walls of a building have a frequency of about one hundred cycles per second.
459,(Of course it has nothing to do with the air!
460,We can have radio broadcasts without any air.)
461,"If we again increase the frequency, we come into the range that is used for FM and TV."
462,"Going still further, we use certain short waves, for example for radar."
463,"Still higher, and we do not need an instrument to “see” the stuff, we can see it with the human eye."
464,"Frequencies below this range are called infrared, and above it, ultraviolet."
465,"The fact that we can see in a particular frequency range makes that part of the electromagnetic spectrum no more impressive than the other parts from a physicist’s standpoint, but from a human standpoint, of course, it is more interesting."
466,"If we go up even higher in frequency, we get x-rays."
467,X-rays are nothing but very high-frequency light.
468,"If we go still higher, we get gamma rays."
469,"These two terms, x-rays and gamma rays, are used almost synonymously."
470,"Usually electromagnetic rays coming from nuclei are called gamma rays, while those of high energy from atoms are called x-rays, but at the same frequency they are indistinguishable physically, no matter what their source."
471,We can find electromagnetic waves with stupendously high frequencies—with even a thousand times more rapid oscillation—in the waves found in cosmic rays.
472,These waves cannot be controlled by us.
473,"Having described the idea of the electromagnetic field, and that this field can carry waves, we soon learn that these waves actually behave in a strange way which seems very unwavelike."
474,At higher frequencies they behave much more like particles!
475,"It is quantum mechanics, discovered just after 1920, which explains this strange behavior."
476,"In the years before 1920, the picture of space as a three-dimensional space, and of time as a separate thing, was changed by Einstein, first into a combination which we call space-time, and then still further into a curved space-time to represent gravitation."
477,"So the “stage” is changed into space-time, and gravitation is presumably a modification of space-time."
478,Then it was also found that the rules for the motions of particles were incorrect.
479,The mechanical rules of “inertia” and “forces” are wrong—Newton’s laws are wrong—in the world of atoms.
480,"Instead, it was discovered that things on a small scale behave nothing like things on a large scale."
481,That is what makes physics difficult—and very interesting.
482,It is hard because the way things behave on a small scale is so “unnatural”; we have no direct experience with it.
483,"Here things behave like nothing we know of, so that it is impossible to describe this behavior in any other than analytic ways."
484,"It is difficult, and takes a lot of imagination."
485,Quantum mechanics has many aspects.
486,"In the first place, the idea that a particle has a definite location and a definite speed is no longer allowed; that is wrong."
487,"To give an example of how wrong classical physics is, there is a rule in quantum mechanics that says that one cannot know both where something is and how fast it is moving."
488,"The uncertainty of the momentum and the uncertainty of the position are complementary, and the product of the two is bounded by a small constant."
489,"This rule is the explanation of a very mysterious paradox: if the atoms are made out of plus and minus charges, why don’t the minus charges simply sit on top of the plus charges (they attract each other) and get so close as to completely cancel them out?"
490,Why are atoms so big?
491,Why is the nucleus at the center with the electrons around it?
492,"It was first thought that this was because the nucleus was so big; but no, the nucleus is very small."
493,"If we had an atom and wished to see the nucleus, we would have to magnify it until the whole atom was the size of a large room, and then the nucleus would be a bare speck which you could just about make out with the eye, but very nearly all the weight of the atom is in that infinitesimal nucleus."
494,What keeps the electrons from simply falling in?
495,"This principle: If they were in the nucleus, we would know their position precisely, and the uncertainty principle would then require that they have a very large (but uncertain) momentum, i.e., a very large kinetic energy."
496,With this energy they would break away from the nucleus.
497,They make a compromise: they leave themselves a little room for this uncertainty and then jiggle with a certain amount of minimum motion in accordance with this rule.
498,"(Remember that when a crystal is cooled to absolute zero, we said that the atoms do not stop moving, they still jiggle."
499,Why?
500,"If they stopped moving, we would know where they were and that they had zero motion, and that is against the uncertainty principle."
501,"We cannot know where they are and how fast they are moving, so they must be continually wiggling in there!)"
502,Another most interesting change in the ideas and philosophy of science brought about by quantum mechanics is this: it is not possible to predict exactly what will happen in any circumstance.
503,"For example, it is possible to arrange an atom which is ready to emit light, and we can measure when it has emitted light by picking up a photon particle, which we shall describe shortly."
504,"We cannot, however, predict when it is going to emit the light or, with several atoms, which one is going to."
505,You may say that this is because there are some internal “wheels” which we have not looked at closely enough.
506,"No, there are no internal wheels; nature, as we understand it today, behaves in such a way that it is fundamentally impossible to make a precise prediction of exactly what will happen in a given experiment."
507,"This is a horrible thing; in fact, philosophers have said before that one of the fundamental requisites of science is that whenever you set up the same conditions, the same thing must happen."
508,"This is simply not true, it is not a fundamental condition of science."
509,"The fact is that the same thing does not happen, that we can find only an average, statistically, as to what happens."
510,"Nevertheless, science has not completely collapsed."
511,"Philosophers, incidentally, say a great deal about what is absolutely necessary for science, and it is always, so far as one can see, rather naive, and probably wrong."
512,"For example, some philosopher or other said it is fundamental to the scientific effort that if an experiment is performed in, say, Stockholm, and then the same experiment is done in, say, Quito, the same results must occur."
513,That is quite false.
514,"It is not necessary that science does that; it may be a fact of experience, but it is not necessary."
515,"For example, if one of the experiments is to look out at the sky and see the aurora borealis in Stockholm, you do not see it in Quito; that is a different phenomenon."
516,"“But,” you say, “that is something that has to do with the outside; can you close yourself up in a box in Stockholm and pull down the shade and get any difference?” Surely."
517,"If we take a pendulum on a universal joint, and pull it out and let go, then the pendulum will swing almost in a plane, but not quite."
518,"Slowly the plane keeps changing in Stockholm, but not in Quito."
519,"The blinds are down, too."
520,The fact that this happened does not bring on the destruction of science.
521,"What is the fundamental hypothesis of science, the fundamental philosophy?"
522,We stated it in the first chapter: the sole test of the validity of any idea is experiment.
523,"If it turns out that most experiments work out the same in Quito as they do in Stockholm, then those “most experiments” will be used to formulate some general law, and those experiments which do not come out the same we will say were a result of the environment near Stockholm."
524,"We will invent some way to summarize the results of the experiment, and we do not have to be told ahead of time what this way will look like."
525,"If we are told that the same experiment will always produce the same result, that is all very well, but if when we try it, it does not, then it does not."
526,"We just have to take what we see, and then formulate all the rest of our ideas in terms of our actual experience."
527,"Returning again to quantum mechanics and fundamental physics, we cannot go into details of the quantum-mechanical principles at this time, of course, because these are rather difficult to understand."
528,"We shall assume that they are there, and go on to describe what some of the consequences are."
529,"One of the consequences is that things which we used to consider as waves also behave like particles, and particles behave like waves; in fact everything behaves the same way."
530,There is no distinction between a wave and a particle.
531,"So quantum mechanics unifies the idea of the field and its waves, and the particles, all into one."
532,"Now it is true that when the frequency is low, the field aspect of the phenomenon is more evident, or more useful as an approximate description in terms of everyday experiences."
533,"But as the frequency increases, the particle aspects of the phenomenon become more evident with the equipment with which we usually make the measurements."
534,"We only deduce the higher frequencies from the energy of the particles, by a rule which assumes that the particle-wave idea of quantum mechanics is valid."
535,Thus we have a new view of electromagnetic interaction.
536,"We have a new kind of particle to add to the electron, the proton, and the neutron."
537,That new particle is called a photon.
538,"The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, is called quantum electrodynamics."
539,"This fundamental theory of the interaction of light and matter, or electric field and charges, is our greatest success so far in physics."
540,In this one theory we have the basic rules for all ordinary phenomena except for gravitation and nuclear processes.
541,"For example, out of quantum electrodynamics come all known electrical, mechanical, and chemical laws: the laws for the collision of billiard balls, the motions of wires in magnetic fields, the specific heat of carbon monoxide, the color of neon signs, the density of salt, and the reactions of hydrogen and oxygen to make water are all consequences of this one law."
542,"All these details can be worked out if the situation is simple enough for us to make an approximation, which is almost never, but often we can understand more or less what is happening."
543,"At the present time no exceptions are found to the quantum-electrodynamic laws outside the nucleus, and there we do not know whether there is an exception because we simply do not know what is going on in the nucleus."
544,"In principle, then, quantum electrodynamics is the theory of all chemistry, and of life, if life is ultimately reduced to chemistry and therefore just to physics because chemistry is already reduced (the part of physics which is involved in chemistry being already known)."
545,"Furthermore, the same quantum electrodynamics, this great thing, predicts a lot of new things."
546,"In the first place, it tells the properties of very high-energy photons, gamma rays, etc."
547,"It predicted another very remarkable thing: besides the electron, there should be another particle of the same mass, but of opposite charge, called a positron, and these two, coming together, could annihilate each other with the emission of light or gamma rays."
548,"(After all, light and gamma rays are all the same, they are just different points on a frequency scale.)"
549,"The generalization of this, that for each particle there is an antiparticle, turns out to be true."
550,"In the case of electrons, the antiparticle has another name—it is called a positron, but for most other particles, it is called anti-so-and-so, like antiproton or antineutron."
551,"In quantum electrodynamics, two numbers are put in and most of the other numbers in the world are supposed to come out."
552,The two numbers that are put in are called the mass of the electron and the charge of the electron.
553,"Actually, that is not quite true, for we have a whole set of numbers for chemistry which tells how heavy the nuclei are."
554,That leads us to the next part.
555,"What are the nuclei made of, and how are they held together?"
556,It is found that the nuclei are held together by enormous forces.
557,"When these are released, the energy released is tremendous compared with chemical energy, in the same ratio as the atomic bomb explosion is to a TNT explosion, because, of course, the atomic bomb has to do with changes inside the nucleus, while the explosion of TNT has to do with the changes of the electrons on the outside of the atoms."
558,"The question is, what are the forces which hold the protons and neutrons together in the nucleus?"
559,"Just as the electrical interaction can be connected to a particle, a photon, Yukawa suggested that the forces between neutrons and protons also have a field of some kind, and that when this field jiggles it behaves like a particle."
560,"Thus there could be some other particles in the world besides protons and neutrons, and he was able to deduce the properties of these particles from the already known characteristics of nuclear forces."
561,"For example, he predicted they should have a mass of two or three hundred times that of an electron; and lo and behold, in cosmic rays there was discovered a particle of the right mass!"
562,But it later turned out to be the wrong particle.
563,"Besides the proton and the neutron, then, in order to get nuclear forces we must add the pion."
564,"Now, you say, “Oh great!, with this theory we make quantum nucleodynamics using the pions just like Yukawa wanted to do, and see if it works, and everything will be explained.” Bad luck."
565,"It turns out that the calculations that are involved in this theory are so difficult that no one has ever been able to figure out what the consequences of the theory are, or to check it against experiment, and this has been going on now for almost twenty years!"
566,"So we are stuck with a theory, and we do not know whether it is right or wrong, but we do know that it is a little wrong, or at least incomplete."
567,"While we have been dawdling around theoretically, trying to calculate the consequences of this theory, the experimentalists have been discovering some things."
568,"For example, they had already discovered this muon, and we do not yet know where it fits."
569,"Also, in cosmic rays, a large number of other “extra” particles were found."
570,"It turns out that today we have approximately thirty particles, and it is very difficult to understand the relationships of all these particles, and what nature wants them for, or what the connections are from one to another."
571,"We do not today understand these various particles as different aspects of the same thing, and the fact that we have so many unconnected particles is a representation of the fact that we have so much unconnected information without a good theory."
572,"After the great successes of quantum electrodynamics, there is a certain amount of knowledge of nuclear physics which is rough knowledge, sort of half experience and half theory, assuming a type of force between protons and neutrons and seeing what will happen, but not really understanding where the force comes from."
573,"Aside from that, we have made very little progress."
574,We have collected an enormous number of chemical elements.
575,"In the chemical case, there suddenly appeared a relationship among these elements which was unexpected, and which is embodied in the periodic table of Mendeleev."
576,"For example, sodium and potassium are about the same in their chemical properties and are found in the same column in the Mendeleev chart."
577,We have been seeking a Mendeleev-type chart for the new particles.
578,One such chart of the new particles was made independently by Gell-Mann in the U.S.A. and Nishijima in Japan.
579,"This number is conserved, like the electric charge, in reactions which take place by nuclear forces."
580,In Table 2–2 are listed all the particles.
581,"We cannot discuss them much at this stage, but the table will at least show you how much we do not know."
582,"Underneath each particle its mass is given in a certain unit, called the MeV."
583,"The reason this unit was chosen is historical, and we shall not go into it now."
584,More massive particles are put higher up on the chart; we see that a neutron and a proton have almost the same mass.
585,"In vertical columns we have put the particles with the same electrical charge, all neutral objects in one column, all positively charged ones to the right of this one, and all negatively charged objects to the left."
586,Particles are shown with a solid line and “resonances” with a dashed one.
587,Several particles have been omitted from the table.
588,"The antiparticles of the mesons are listed in the table, but the antiparticles of the leptons and baryons would have to be listed in another table which would look exactly like this one reflected on the zero-charge column."
589,"Although all of the particles except the electron, neutrino, photon, graviton, and proton are unstable, decay products have been shown only for the resonances."
590,"Strangeness assignments are not applicable for leptons, since they do not interact strongly with nuclei."
591,"There are groups or multiplets with almost the same mass, within one or two percent."
592,Each particle in a multiplet has the same strangeness.
593,"The first multiplet is the proton-neutron doublet, and then there is a singlet (the lambda) then the sigma triplet, and finally the xi doublet."
594,"Very recently, in 1961, even a few more particles were found."
595,Or are they particles?
596,In addition to the baryons the other particles which are involved in the nuclear interaction are called mesons.
597,"There are first the pions, which come in three varieties, positive, negative, and neutral; they form another multiplet."
598,"Also, every particle has its antiparticle, unless a particle is its own antiparticle."
599,"In addition, in 1961 we also found some more mesons or maybe mesons which disintegrate almost immediately."
600,"These particles, called mesons and baryons, and the antiparticles of the mesons are on the same chart, but the antiparticles of the baryons must be put on another chart, “reflected” through the charge-zero column."
601,"Just as Mendeleev’s chart was very good, except for the fact that there were a number of rare earth elements which were hanging out loose from it, so we have a number of things hanging out loose from this chart—particles which do not interact strongly in nuclei, have nothing to do with a nuclear interaction, and do not have a strong interaction (I mean the powerful kind of interaction of nuclear energy)."
602,"So far as we can tell, by all experiments so far, the difference between the electron and the muon is nothing but the mass."
603,"Everything works exactly the same for the muon as for the electron, except that one is heavier than the other."
604,Why is there another one heavier; what is the use for it?
605,We do not know.
606,"In addition, there is a lepton which is neutral, called a neutrino, and this particle has zero mass."
607,"In fact, it is now known that there are two different kinds of neutrinos, one related to electrons and the other related to muons."
608,"Finally, we have two other particles which do not interact strongly with the nuclear ones: one is a photon, and perhaps, if the field of gravity also has a quantum-mechanical analog (a quantum theory of gravitation has not yet been worked out), then there will be a particle, a graviton, which will have zero mass."
609,What is this “zero mass”?
610,The masses given here are the masses of the particles at rest.
611,"The fact that a particle has zero mass means, in a way, that it cannot be at rest."
612,"We will understand more what mass means when we understand the theory of relativity, which will come in due time."
613,"Thus we are confronted with a large number of particles, which together seem to be the fundamental constituents of matter."
614,"Fortunately, these particles are not all different in their interactions with one another."
615,"In fact, there seem to be just four kinds of interaction between particles which, in the order of decreasing strength, are the nuclear force, electrical interactions, the beta-decay interaction, and gravity."
616,"The detailed law of this coupling is known, that is quantum electrodynamics."
617,"Gravity is coupled to all energy, but its coupling is extremely weak, much weaker than that of electricity."
618,This law is also known.
619,"Then there are the so-called weak decays—beta decay, which causes the neutron to disintegrate into proton, electron, and neutrino, relatively slowly."
620,This law is only partly known.
621,"This then, is the horrible condition of our physics today."
622,"To summarize it, I would say this: outside the nucleus, we seem to know all; inside it, quantum mechanics is valid—the principles of quantum mechanics have not been found to fail."
623,"The stage on which we put all of our knowledge, we would say, is relativistic space-time; perhaps gravity is involved in space-time."
624,"We do not know how the universe got started, and we have never made experiments which check our ideas of space and time accurately, below some tiny distance, so we only know that our ideas work above that distance."
625,"We should also add that the rules of the game are the quantum-mechanical principles, and those principles apply, so far as we can tell, to the new particles as well as to the old."
626,"The origin of the forces in nuclei leads us to new particles, but unfortunately they appear in great profusion and we lack a complete understanding of their interrelationship, although we already know that there are some very surprising relationships among them."
627,"We seem gradually to be groping toward an understanding of the world of subatomic particles, but we really do not know how far we have yet to go in this task."
628,(There was no summary for this lecture.)
629,"Physics is the most fundamental and all-inclusive of the sciences, and has had a profound effect on all scientific development."
630,"In fact, physics is the present-day equivalent of what used to be called natural philosophy, from which most of our modern sciences arose."
631,Students of many fields find themselves studying physics because of the basic role it plays in all phenomena.
632,"In this chapter we shall try to explain what the fundamental problems in the other sciences are, but of course it is impossible in so small a space really to deal with the complex, subtle, beautiful matters in these other fields."
633,"Lack of space also prevents our discussing the relation of physics to engineering, industry, society, and war, or even the most remarkable relationship between mathematics and physics."
634,"(Mathematics is not a science from our point of view, in the sense that it is not a natural science."
635,The test of its validity is not experiment.)
636,"We must, incidentally, make it clear from the beginning that if a thing is not a science, it is not necessarily bad."
637,"For example, love is not a science."
638,"So, if something is said not to be a science, it does not mean that there is something wrong with it; it just means that it is not a science."
639,The science which is perhaps the most deeply affected by physics is chemistry.
640,"Historically, the early days of chemistry dealt almost entirely with what we now call inorganic chemistry, the chemistry of substances which are not associated with living things."
641,"Considerable analysis was required to discover the existence of the many elements and their relationships—how they make the various relatively simple compounds found in rocks, earth, etc."
642,This early chemistry was very important for physics.
643,The interaction between the two sciences was very great because the theory of atoms was substantiated to a large extent by experiments in chemistry.
644,"The theory of chemistry, i.e., of the reactions themselves, was summarized to a large extent in the periodic chart of Mendeleev, which brings out many strange relationships among the various elements, and it was the collection of rules as to which substance is combined with which, and how, that constituted inorganic chemistry."
645,"All these rules were ultimately explained in principle by quantum mechanics, so that theoretical chemistry is in fact physics."
646,"On the other hand, it must be emphasized that this explanation is in principle."
647,"We have already discussed the difference between knowing the rules of the game of chess, and being able to play."
648,"So it is that we may know the rules, but we cannot play very well."
649,"It turns out to be very difficult to predict precisely what will happen in a given chemical reaction; nevertheless, the deepest part of theoretical chemistry must end up in quantum mechanics."
650,"There is also a branch of physics and chemistry which was developed by both sciences together, and which is extremely important."
651,"This is the method of statistics applied in a situation in which there are mechanical laws, which is aptly called statistical mechanics."
652,"In any chemical situation a large number of atoms are involved, and we have seen that the atoms are all jiggling around in a very random and complicated way."
653,"If we could analyze each collision, and be able to follow in detail the motion of each molecule, we might hope to figure out what would happen, but the many numbers needed to keep track of all these molecules exceeds so enormously the capacity of any computer, and certainly the capacity of the mind, that it was important to develop a method for dealing with such complicated situations."
654,"Statistical mechanics, then, is the science of the phenomena of heat, or thermodynamics."
655,"Inorganic chemistry is, as a science, now reduced essentially to what are called physical chemistry and quantum chemistry; physical chemistry to study the rates at which reactions occur and what is happening in detail (How do the molecules hit?"
656,"Which pieces fly off first?, etc."
657,"), and quantum chemistry to help us understand what happens in terms of the physical laws."
658,"The other branch of chemistry is organic chemistry, the chemistry of the substances which are associated with living things."
659,"For a time it was believed that the substances which are associated with living things were so marvelous that they could not be made by hand, from inorganic materials."
660,"This is not at all true—they are just the same as the substances made in inorganic chemistry, but more complicated arrangements of atoms are involved."
661,"Organic chemistry obviously has a very close relationship to the biology which supplies its substances, and to industry, and furthermore, much physical chemistry and quantum mechanics can be applied to organic as well as to inorganic compounds."
662,"However, the main problems of organic chemistry are not in these aspects, but rather in the analysis and synthesis of the substances which are formed in biological systems, in living things."
663,"This leads imperceptibly, in steps, toward biochemistry, and then into biology itself, or molecular biology."
664,"Thus we come to the science of biology, which is the study of living things."
665,"In the early days of biology, the biologists had to deal with the purely descriptive problem of finding out what living things there were, and so they just had to count such things as the hairs of the limbs of fleas."
666,"After these matters were worked out with a great deal of interest, the biologists went into the machinery inside the living bodies, first from a gross standpoint, naturally, because it takes some effort to get into the finer details."
667,"There was an interesting early relationship between physics and biology in which biology helped physics in the discovery of the conservation of energy, which was first demonstrated by Mayer in connection with the amount of heat taken in and given out by a living creature."
668,"If we look at the processes of biology of living animals more closely, we see many physical phenomena: the circulation of blood, pumps, pressure, etc."
669,"There are nerves: we know what is happening when we step on a sharp stone, and that somehow or other the information goes from the leg up."
670,It is interesting how that happens.
671,"In their study of nerves, the biologists have come to the conclusion that nerves are very fine tubes with a complex wall which is very thin; through this wall the cell pumps ions, so that there are positive ions on the outside and negative ions on the inside, like a capacitor."
672,"Now this membrane has an interesting property; if it “discharges” in one place, i.e., if some of the ions were able to move through one place, so that the electric voltage is reduced there, that electrical influence makes itself felt on the ions in the neighborhood, and it affects the membrane in such a way that it lets the ions through at neighboring points also."
673,"This in turn affects it farther along, etc., and so there is a wave of “penetrability” of the membrane which runs down the fiber when it is “excited” at one end by stepping on the sharp stone."
674,"This wave is somewhat analogous to a long sequence of vertical dominoes; if the end one is pushed over, that one pushes the next, etc."
675,"Of course this will transmit only one message unless the dominoes are set up again; and similarly in the nerve cell, there are processes which pump the ions slowly out again, to get the nerve ready for the next impulse."
676,So it is that we know what we are doing (or at least where we are).
677,"Of course the electrical effects associated with this nerve impulse can be picked up with electrical instruments, and because there are electrical effects, obviously the physics of electrical effects has had a great deal of influence on understanding the phenomenon."
678,"The opposite effect is that, from somewhere in the brain, a message is sent out along a nerve."
679,What happens at the end of the nerve?
680,"There the nerve branches out into fine little things, connected to a structure near a muscle, called an endplate."
681,"For reasons which are not exactly understood, when the impulse reaches the end of the nerve, little packets of a chemical called acetylcholine are shot off (five or ten molecules at a time) and they affect the muscle fiber and make it contract—how simple!"
682,What makes a muscle contract?
683,"A muscle is a very large number of fibers close together, containing two different substances, myosin and actomyosin, but the machinery by which the chemical reaction induced by acetylcholine can modify the dimensions of the muscle is not yet known."
684,Thus the fundamental processes in the muscle that make mechanical motions are not known.
685,"Biology is such an enormously wide field that there are hosts of other problems that we cannot mention at all—problems on how vision works (what the light does in the eye), how hearing works, etc."
686,(The way in which thinking works we shall discuss later under psychology.)
687,"Now, these things concerning biology which we have just discussed are, from a biological standpoint, really not fundamental, at the bottom of life, in the sense that even if we understood them we still would not understand life itself."
688,"To illustrate: the men who study nerves feel their work is very important, because after all you cannot have animals without nerves."
689,But you can have life without nerves.
690,"Plants have neither nerves nor muscles, but they are working, they are alive, just the same."
691,"So for the fundamental problems of biology we must look deeper; when we do, we discover that all living things have a great many characteristics in common."
692,"The most common feature is that they are made of cells, within each of which is complex machinery for doing things chemically."
693,"In plant cells, for example, there is machinery for picking up light and generating glucose, which is consumed in the dark to keep the plant alive."
694,When the plant is eaten the glucose itself generates in the animal a series of chemical reactions very closely related to photosynthesis (and its opposite effect in the dark) in plants.
695,"In the cells of living systems there are many elaborate chemical reactions, in which one compound is changed into another and another."
696,"To give some impression of the enormous efforts that have gone into the study of biochemistry, the chart in Fig."
697,"3–1 summarizes our knowledge to date on just one small part of the many series of reactions which occur in cells, perhaps a percent or so of it."
698,Here we see a whole series of molecules which change from one to another in a sequence or cycle of rather small steps.
699,"It is called the Krebs cycle, the respiratory cycle."
700,"Each of the chemicals and each of the steps is fairly simple, in terms of what change is made in the molecule, but—and this is a centrally important discovery in biochemistry—these changes are relatively difficult to accomplish in a laboratory."
701,"If we have one substance and another very similar substance, the one does not just turn into the other, because the two forms are usually separated by an energy barrier or “hill.” Consider this analogy: If we wanted to take an object from one place to another, at the same level but on the other side of a hill, we could push it over the top, but to do so requires the addition of some energy."
702,"Thus most chemical reactions do not occur, because there is what is called an activation energy in the way."
703,In order to add an extra atom to our chemical requires that we get it close enough that some rearrangement can occur; then it will stick.
704,"But if we cannot give it enough energy to get it close enough, it will not go to completion, it will just go part way up the “hill” and back down again."
705,"However, if we could literally take the molecules in our hands and push and pull the atoms around in such a way as to open a hole to let the new atom in, and then let it snap back, we would have found another way, around the hill, which would not require extra energy, and the reaction would go easily."
706,"Now there actually are, in the cells, very large molecules, much larger than the ones whose changes we have been describing, which in some complicated way hold the smaller molecules just right, so that the reaction can occur easily."
707,These very large and complicated things are called enzymes.
708,"(They were first called ferments, because they were originally discovered in the fermentation of sugar."
709,"In fact, some of the first reactions in the cycle were discovered there.)"
710,In the presence of an enzyme the reaction will go.
711,An enzyme is made of another substance called protein.
712,"Enzymes are very big and complicated, and each one is different, each being built to control a certain special reaction."
713,The names of the enzymes are written in Fig.
714,3–1 at each reaction.
715,(Sometimes the same enzyme may control two reactions.)
716,We emphasize that the enzymes themselves are not involved in the reaction directly.
717,They do not change; they merely let an atom go from one place to another.
718,"Having done so, the enzyme is ready to do it to the next molecule, like a machine in a factory."
719,"Of course, there must be a supply of certain atoms and a way of disposing of other atoms."
720,"Take hydrogen, for example: there are enzymes which have special units on them which carry the hydrogen for all chemical reactions."
721,"For example, there are three or four hydrogen-reducing enzymes which are used all over our cycle in different places."
722,It is interesting that the machinery which liberates some hydrogen at one place will take that hydrogen and use it somewhere else.
723,The most important feature of the cycle of Fig.
724,3–1 is the transformation from GDP to GTP (guanosine-di-phosphate to guanosine-tri-phosphate) because the one substance has much more energy in it than the other.
725,"Just as there is a “box” in certain enzymes for carrying hydrogen atoms around, there are special energy-carrying “boxes” which involve the triphosphate group."
726,"So, GTP has more energy than GDP and if the cycle is going one way, we are producing molecules which have extra energy and which can go drive some other cycle which requires energy, for example the contraction of muscle."
727,The muscle will not contract unless there is GTP.
728,"We can take muscle fiber, put it in water, and add GTP, and the fibers contract, changing GTP to GDP if the right enzymes are present."
729,So the real system is in the GDP-GTP transformation; in the dark the GTP which has been stored up during the day is used to run the whole cycle around the other way.
730,"An enzyme, you see, does not care in which direction the reaction goes, for if it did it would violate one of the laws of physics."
731,"Physics is of great importance in biology and other sciences for still another reason, that has to do with experimental techniques."
732,"In fact, if it were not for the great development of experimental physics, these biochemistry charts would not be known today."
733,The reason is that the most useful tool of all for analyzing this fantastically complex system is to label the atoms which are used in the reactions.
734,"Thus, if we could introduce into the cycle some carbon dioxide which has a “green mark” on it, and then measure after three seconds where the green mark is, and again measure after ten seconds, etc., we could trace out the course of the reactions."
735,What are the “green marks”?
736,They are different isotopes.
737,"We recall that the chemical properties of atoms are determined by the number of electrons, not by the mass of the nucleus."
738,"But there can be, for example in carbon, six neutrons or seven neutrons, together with the six protons which all carbon nuclei have."
739,"Now, we return to the description of enzymes and proteins."
740,"Not all proteins are enzymes, but all enzymes are proteins."
741,"There are many proteins, such as the proteins in muscle, the structural proteins which are, for example, in cartilage and hair, skin, etc., that are not themselves enzymes."
742,"However, proteins are a very characteristic substance of life: first of all they make up all the enzymes, and second, they make up much of the rest of living material."
743,Proteins have a very interesting and simple structure.
744,"They are a series, or chain, of different amino acids."
745,"There are twenty different amino acids, and they all can combine with each other to form chains in which the backbone is CO-NH, etc."
746,Proteins are nothing but chains of various ones of these twenty amino acids.
747,Each of the amino acids probably serves some special purpose.
748,"Some, for example, have a sulfur atom at a certain place; when two sulfur atoms are in the same protein, they form a bond, that is, they tie the chain together at two points and form a loop."
749,"Another has extra oxygen atoms which make it an acidic substance, another has a basic characteristic."
750,"Some of them have big groups hanging out to one side, so that they take up a lot of space."
751,"One of the amino acids, called proline, is not really an amino acid, but imino acid."
752,"There is a slight difference, with the result that when proline is in the chain, there is a kink in the chain."
753,"If we wished to manufacture a particular protein, we would give these instructions: put one of those sulfur hooks here; next, add something to take up space; then attach something to put a kink in the chain."
754,"In this way, we will get a complicated-looking chain, hooked together and having some complex structure; this is presumably just the manner in which all the various enzymes are made."
755,"One of the great triumphs in recent times (since 1960), was at last to discover the exact spatial atomic arrangement of certain proteins, which involve some fifty-six or sixty amino acids in a row."
756,"Over a thousand atoms (more nearly two thousand, if we count the hydrogen atoms) have been located in a complex pattern in two proteins."
757,The first was hemoglobin.
758,One of the sad aspects of this discovery is that we cannot see anything from the pattern; we do not understand why it works the way it does.
759,"Of course, that is the next problem to be attacked."
760,Another problem is how do the enzymes know what to be?
761,"A red-eyed fly makes a red-eyed fly baby, and so the information for the whole pattern of enzymes to make red pigment must be passed from one fly to the next."
762,"This is done by a substance in the nucleus of the cell, not a protein, called DNA (short for desoxyribose nucleic acid)."
763,This is the key substance which is passed from one cell to another (for instance sperm cells consist mostly of DNA) and carries the information as to how to make the enzymes.
764,DNA is the “blueprint.” What does the blueprint look like and how does it work?
765,"First, the blueprint must be able to reproduce itself."
766,"Secondly, it must be able to instruct the protein."
767,"Concerning the reproduction, we might think that this proceeds like cell reproduction."
768,Cells simply grow bigger and then divide in half.
769,"Must it be thus with DNA molecules, then, that they too grow bigger and divide in half?"
770,Every atom certainly does not grow bigger and divide in half!
771,"No, it is impossible to reproduce a molecule except by some more clever way."
772,"The structure of the substance DNA was studied for a long time, first chemically to find the composition, and then with x-rays to find the pattern in space."
773,"The result was the following remarkable discovery: The DNA molecule is a pair of chains, twisted upon each other."
774,"The backbone of each of these chains, which are analogous to the chains of proteins but chemically quite different, is a series of sugar and phosphate groups, as shown in Fig."
775,3–2.
776,"Thus perhaps, in some way, the specific instructions for the manufacture of proteins are contained in the specific series of the DNA."
777,"Attached to each sugar along the line, and linking the two chains together, are certain pairs of cross-links."
778,"These pairs are put on the two chains in such a way that they “fit together,” and have a strong energy of interaction."
779,"Whatever the letters may be in one chain, each one must have its specific complementary letter on the other chain."
780,What then about reproduction?
781,Suppose we split this chain in two.
782,How can we make another one just like it?
783,This is the central unsolved problem in biology today.
784,"The first clues, or pieces of information, however, are these: There are in the cell tiny particles called ribosomes, and it is now known that that is the place where proteins are made."
785,"But the ribosomes are not in the nucleus, where the DNA and its instructions are."
786,Something seems to be the matter.
787,"However, it is also known that little molecule pieces come off the DNA—not as long as the big DNA molecule that carries all the information itself, but like a small section of it."
788,"This is called RNA, but that is not essential."
789,"It is a kind of copy of the DNA, a short copy."
790,"The RNA, which somehow carries a message as to what kind of protein to make goes over to the ribosome; that is known."
791,"When it gets there, protein is synthesized at the ribosome."
792,That is also known.
793,"However, the details of how the amino acids come in and are arranged in accordance with a code that is on the RNA are, as yet, still unknown."
794,We do not know how to read it.
795,"Certainly no subject or field is making more progress on so many fronts at the present moment, than biology, and if we were to name the most powerful assumption of all, which leads one on and on in an attempt to understand life, it is that all things are made of atoms, and that everything that living things do can be understood in terms of the jigglings and wigglings of atoms."
796,"In this rapid-fire explanation of the whole world, we must now turn to astronomy."
797,Astronomy is older than physics.
798,"In fact, it got physics started by showing the beautiful simplicity of the motion of the stars and planets, the understanding of which was the beginning of physics."
799,But the most remarkable discovery in all of astronomy is that the stars are made of atoms of the same kind as those on the earth.1 How was this done?
800,"Atoms liberate light which has definite frequencies, something like the timbre of a musical instrument, which has definite pitches or frequencies of sound."
801,"When we are listening to several different tones we can tell them apart, but when we look with our eyes at a mixture of colors we cannot tell the parts from which it was made, because the eye is nowhere near as discerning as the ear in this connection."
802,"However, with a spectroscope we can analyze the frequencies of the light waves and in this way we can see the very tunes of the atoms that are in the different stars."
803,"As a matter of fact, two of the chemical elements were discovered on a star before they were discovered on the earth."
804,"Helium was discovered on the sun, whence its name, and technetium was discovered in certain cool stars."
805,"This, of course, permits us to make headway in understanding the stars, because they are made of the same kinds of atoms which are on the earth."
806,"Now we know a great deal about the atoms, especially concerning their behavior under conditions of high temperature but not very great density, so that we can analyze by statistical mechanics the behavior of the stellar substance."
807,"Even though we cannot reproduce the conditions on the earth, using the basic physical laws we often can tell precisely, or very closely, what will happen."
808,So it is that physics aids astronomy.
809,"Strange as it may seem, we understand the distribution of matter in the interior of the sun far better than we understand the interior of the earth."
810,"What goes on inside a star is better understood than one might guess from the difficulty of having to look at a little dot of light through a telescope, because we can calculate what the atoms in the stars should do in most circumstances."
811,"One of the most impressive discoveries was the origin of the energy of the stars, that makes them continue to burn."
812,One of the men who discovered this was out with his girlfriend the night after he realized that nuclear reactions must be going on in the stars in order to make them shine.
813,"She said “Look at how pretty the stars shine!” He said “Yes, and right now I am the only man in the world who knows why they shine.” She merely laughed at him."
814,"She was not impressed with being out with the only man who, at that moment, knew why stars shine."
815,"Well, it is sad to be alone, but that is the way it is in this world."
816,It is the nuclear “burning” of hydrogen which supplies the energy of the sun; the hydrogen is converted into helium.
817,"Furthermore, ultimately, the manufacture of various chemical elements proceeds in the centers of the stars, from hydrogen."
818,"The stuff of which we are made, was “cooked” once, in a star, and spit out."
819,How do we know?
820,Because there is a clue.
821,The proportions are purely the result of nuclear reactions.
822,"By looking at the proportions of the isotopes in the cold, dead ember which we are, we can discover what the furnace was like in which the stuff of which we are made was formed."
823,"That furnace was like the stars, and so it is very likely that our elements were “made” in the stars and spit out in the explosions which we call novae and supernovae."
824,Astronomy is so close to physics that we shall study many astronomical things as we go along.
825,"We turn now to what are called earth sciences, or geology."
826,"First, meteorology and the weather."
827,"Of course the instruments of meteorology are physical instruments, and the development of experimental physics made these instruments possible, as was explained before."
828,"However, the theory of meteorology has never been satisfactorily worked out by the physicist."
829,"“Well,” you say, “there is nothing but air, and we know the equations of the motions of air.” Yes we do."
830,"“So if we know the condition of air today, why can’t we figure out the condition of the air tomorrow?” First, we do not really know what the condition is today, because the air is swirling and twisting everywhere."
831,"It turns out to be very sensitive, and even unstable."
832,"If you have ever seen water run smoothly over a dam, and then turn into a large number of blobs and drops as it falls, you will understand what I mean by unstable."
833,"You know the condition of the water before it goes over the spillway; it is perfectly smooth; but the moment it begins to fall, where do the drops begin?"
834,What determines how big the lumps are going to be and where they will be?
835,"That is not known, because the water is unstable."
836,"Even a smooth moving mass of air, in going over a mountain turns into complex whirlpools and eddies."
837,In many fields we find this situation of turbulent flow that we cannot analyze today.
838,"Quickly we leave the subject of weather, and discuss geology!"
839,"The question basic to geology is, what makes the earth the way it is?"
840,"The most obvious processes are in front of your very eyes, the erosion processes of the rivers, the winds, etc."
841,"It is easy enough to understand these, but for every bit of erosion there is an equal amount of something else going on."
842,"Mountains are no lower today, on the average, than they were in the past."
843,There must be mountain-forming processes.
844,"You will find, if you study geology, that there are mountain-forming processes and volcanism, which nobody understands but which is half of geology."
845,The phenomenon of volcanoes is really not understood.
846,"What makes an earthquake is, ultimately, not understood."
847,"It is understood that if something is pushing something else, it snaps and will slide—that is all right."
848,"But what pushes, and why?"
849,"The theory is that there are currents inside the earth—circulating currents, due to the difference in temperature inside and outside—which, in their motion, push the surface slightly."
850,"Thus if there are two opposite circulations next to each other, the matter will collect in the region where they meet and make belts of mountains which are in unhappy stressed conditions, and so produce volcanoes and earthquakes."
851,What about the inside of the earth?
852,A great deal is known about the speed of earthquake waves through the earth and the density of distribution of the earth.
853,"However, physicists have been unable to get a good theory as to how dense a substance should be at the pressures that would be expected at the center of the earth."
854,"In other words, we cannot figure out the properties of matter very well in these circumstances."
855,We do much less well with the earth than we do with the conditions of matter in the stars.
856,"The mathematics involved seems a little too difficult, so far, but perhaps it will not be too long before someone realizes that it is an important problem, and really works it out."
857,"The other aspect, of course, is that even if we did know the density, we cannot figure out the circulating currents."
858,Nor can we really work out the properties of rocks at high pressure.
859,We cannot tell how fast the rocks should “give”; that must all be worked out by experiment.
860,"Next, we consider the science of psychology."
861,"Incidentally, psychoanalysis is not a science: it is at best a medical process, and perhaps even more like witch-doctoring."
862,"It has a theory as to what causes disease—lots of different “spirits,” etc."
863,"The witch doctor has a theory that a disease like malaria is caused by a spirit which comes into the air; it is not cured by shaking a snake over it, but quinine does help malaria."
864,"So, if you are sick, I would advise that you go to the witch doctor because he is the man in the tribe who knows the most about the disease; on the other hand, his knowledge is not science."
865,"Psychoanalysis has not been checked carefully by experiment, and there is no way to find a list of the number of cases in which it works, the number of cases in which it does not work, etc."
866,"The other branches of psychology, which involve things like the physiology of sensation—what happens in the eye, and what happens in the brain—are, if you wish, less interesting."
867,But some small but real progress has been made in studying them.
868,One of the most interesting technical problems may or may not be called psychology.
869,"The central problem of the mind, if you will, or the nervous system, is this: when an animal learns something, it can do something different than it could before, and its brain cell must have changed too, if it is made out of atoms."
870,In what way is it different?
871,"We do not know where to look, or what to look for, when something is memorized."
872,"We do not know what it means, or what change there is in the nervous system, when a fact is learned."
873,This is a very important problem which has not been solved at all.
874,"Assuming, however, that there is some kind of memory thing, the brain is such an enormous mass of interconnecting wires and nerves that it probably cannot be analyzed in a straightforward manner."
875,"There is an analog of this to computing machines and computing elements, in that they also have a lot of lines, and they have some kind of element, analogous, perhaps, to the synapse, or connection of one nerve to another."
876,This is a very interesting subject which we have not the time to discuss further—the relationship between thinking and computing machines.
877,"It must be appreciated, of course, that this subject will tell us very little about the real complexities of ordinary human behavior."
878,All human beings are so different.
879,It will be a long time before we get there.
880,We must start much further back.
881,"If we could even figure out how a dog works, we would have gone pretty far."
882,"Dogs are easier to understand, but nobody yet knows how dogs work."
883,"In order for physics to be useful to other sciences in a theoretical way, other than in the invention of instruments, the science in question must supply to the physicist a description of the object in a physicist’s language."
884,"They can say “why does a frog jump?,” and the physicist cannot answer."
885,"If they tell him what a frog is, that there are so many molecules, there is a nerve here, etc., that is different."
886,"If they will tell us, more or less, what the earth or the stars are like, then we can figure it out."
887,"In order for physical theory to be of any use, we must know where the atoms are located."
888,"In order to understand the chemistry, we must know exactly what atoms are present, for otherwise we cannot analyze it."
889,"That is but one limitation, of course."
890,"There is another kind of problem in the sister sciences which does not exist in physics; we might call it, for lack of a better term, the historical question."
891,How did it get that way?
892,"If we understand all about biology, we will want to know how all the things which are on the earth got there."
893,"There is the theory of evolution, an important part of biology."
894,"In geology, we not only want to know how the mountains are forming, but how the entire earth was formed in the beginning, the origin of the solar system, etc."
895,"That, of course, leads us to want to know what kind of matter there was in the world."
896,How did the stars evolve?
897,What were the initial conditions?
898,That is the problem of astronomical history.
899,"A great deal has been found out about the formation of stars, the formation of elements from which we were made, and even a little about the origin of the universe."
900,There is no historical question being studied in physics at the present time.
901,"We do not have a question, “Here are the laws of physics, how did they get that way?” We do not imagine, at the moment, that the laws of physics are somehow changing with time, that they were different in the past than they are at present."
902,"Of course they may be, and the moment we find they are, the historical question of physics will be wrapped up with the rest of the history of the universe, and then the physicist will be talking about the same problems as astronomers, geologists, and biologists."
903,"Finally, there is a physical problem that is common to many fields, that is very old, and that has not been solved."
904,"It is not the problem of finding new fundamental particles, but something left over from a long time ago—over a hundred years."
905,Nobody in physics has really been able to analyze it mathematically satisfactorily in spite of its importance to the sister sciences.
906,It is the analysis of circulating or turbulent fluids.
907,"If we watch the evolution of a star, there comes a point where we can deduce that it is going to start convection, and thereafter we can no longer deduce what should happen."
908,"A few million years later the star explodes, but we cannot figure out the reason."
909,We cannot analyze the weather.
910,We do not know the patterns of motions that there should be inside the earth.
911,The simplest form of the problem is to take a pipe that is very long and push water through it at high speed.
912,"We ask: to push a given amount of water through that pipe, how much pressure is needed?"
913,No one can analyze it from first principles and the properties of water.
914,"If the water flows very slowly, or if we use a thick goo like honey, then we can do it nicely."
915,You will find that in your textbook.
916,"What we really cannot do is deal with actual, wet water running through a pipe."
917,"That is the central problem which we ought to solve some day, and we have not."
918,"A poet once said, “The whole universe is in a glass of wine.” We will probably never know in what sense he meant that, for poets do not write to be understood."
919,But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely enough we see the entire universe.
920,"There are the things of physics: the twisting liquid which evaporates depending on the wind and weather, the reflections in the glass, and our imagination adds the atoms."
921,"The glass is a distillation of the earth’s rocks, and in its composition we see the secrets of the universe’s age, and the evolution of stars."
922,What strange array of chemicals are in the wine?
923,How did they come to be?
924,"There are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products."
925,There in wine is found the great generalization: all life is fermentation.
926,"Nobody can discover the chemistry of wine without discovering, as did Louis Pasteur, the cause of much disease."
927,"How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it!"
928,"If our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of wine, this universe, into parts—physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on—remember that nature does not know it!"
929,"So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for."
930,Let it give us one more final pleasure: drink it and forget it all!
931,"In this chapter, we begin our more detailed study of the different aspects of physics, having finished our description of things in general."
932,"To illustrate the ideas and the kind of reasoning that might be used in theoretical physics, we shall now examine one of the most basic laws of physics, the conservation of energy."
933,"There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena that are known to date."
934,There is no known exception to this law—it is exact so far as we know.
935,The law is called the conservation of energy.
936,"It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in the manifold changes which nature undergoes."
937,"That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which does not change when something happens."
938,"It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same."
939,"(Something like the bishop on a red square, and after a number of moves—details unknown—it is still on some red square."
940,It is a law of this nature.)
941,"Since it is an abstract idea, we shall illustrate the meaning of it by an analogy."
942,"Imagine a child, perhaps “Dennis the Menace,” who has blocks which are absolutely indestructible, and cannot be divided into pieces."
943,Each is the same as the other.
944,"Careful investigation indicates that the window was open, and upon looking outside, the other two blocks are found."
945,"This causes considerable consternation, until it is realized that Bruce came to visit, bringing his blocks with him, and he left a few at Dennis’ house."
946,"However, there is a box in the room, a toy box, and the mother goes to open the toy box, but the boy says “No, do not open my toy box,” and screams."
947,Mother is not allowed to open the toy box.
948,"Being extremely curious, and somewhat ingenious, she invents a scheme!"
949,"The next time she wishes to check, she weighs the box again, subtracts sixteen ounces and divides by three."
950,"The child is throwing blocks into the water, and she cannot see them because it is so dirty, but she can find out how many blocks are in the water by adding another term to her formula."
951,"As a result, she finds a complex formula, a quantity which has to be computed, which always stays the same in her situation."
952,What is the analogy of this to the conservation of energy?
953,The most remarkable aspect that must be abstracted from this picture is that there are no blocks.
954,Take away the first terms in (4.1) and (4.2) and we find ourselves calculating more or less abstract things.
955,The analogy has the following points.
956,"First, when we are calculating the energy, sometimes some of it leaves the system and goes away, or sometimes some comes in."
957,"In order to verify the conservation of energy, we must be careful that we have not put any in or taken any out."
958,"Second, the energy has a large number of different forms, and there is a formula for each one."
959,"These are: gravitational energy, kinetic energy, heat energy, elastic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, radiant energy, nuclear energy, mass energy."
960,"If we total up the formulas for each of these contributions, it will not change except for energy going in and out."
961,"It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is."
962,We do not have a picture that energy comes in little blobs of a definite amount.
963,It is not that way.
964,It is an abstract thing in that it does not tell us the mechanism or the reasons for the various formulas.
965,Conservation of energy can be understood only if we have the formula for all of its forms.
966,"I wish to discuss the formula for gravitational energy near the surface of the Earth, and I wish to derive this formula in a way which has nothing to do with history but is simply a line of reasoning invented for this particular lecture to give you an illustration of the remarkable fact that a great deal about nature can be extracted from a few facts and close reasoning."
967,It is an illustration of the kind of work theoretical physicists become involved in.
968,It is patterned after a most excellent argument by Mr. Carnot on the efficiency of steam engines.1
969,Consider weight-lifting machines—machines which have the property that they lift one weight by lowering another.
970,Let us also make a hypothesis: that there is no such thing as perpetual motion with these weight-lifting machines.
971,"(In fact, that there is no perpetual motion at all is a general statement of the law of conservation of energy.)"
972,We must be careful to define perpetual motion.
973,"First, let us do it for weight-lifting machines."
974,"If, when we have lifted and lowered a lot of weights and restored the machine to the original condition, we find that the net result is to have lifted a weight, then we have a perpetual motion machine because we can use that lifted weight to run something else."
975,"That is, provided the machine which lifted the weight is brought back to its exact original condition, and furthermore that it is completely self-contained—that it has not received the energy to lift that weight from some external source—like Bruce’s blocks."
976,A very simple weight-lifting machine is shown in Fig.
977,4–1.
978,"This machine lifts weights three units “strong.” We place three units on one balance pan, and one unit on the other."
979,"However, in order to get it actually to work, we must lift a little weight off the left pan."
980,"On the other hand, we could lift a one-unit weight by lowering the three-unit weight, if we cheat a little by lifting a little weight off the other pan."
981,"Of course, we realize that with any actual lifting machine, we must add a little extra to get it to run."
982,"This we disregard, temporarily."
983,"Ideal machines, although they do not exist, do not require anything extra."
984,"A machine that we actually use can be, in a sense, almost reversible: that is, if it will lift the weight of three by lowering a weight of one, then it will also lift nearly the weight of one the same amount by lowering the weight of three."
985,"We imagine that there are two classes of machines, those that are not reversible, which includes all real machines, and those that are reversible, which of course are actually not attainable no matter how careful we may be in our design of bearings, levers, etc."
986,"We suppose, however, that there is such a thing—a reversible machine—which lowers one unit of weight (a pound or any other unit) by one unit of distance, and at the same time lifts a three-unit weight."
987,Let us see why.
988,"This will put the one-unit weight back where it was before, and leave both machines ready to be used again!"
989,We can also see that all reversible machines must lift to exactly the same height.
990,"This, then, is a very remarkable observation because it permits us to analyze the height to which different machines are going to lift something without looking at the interior mechanism."
991,"We know at once that if somebody makes an enormously elaborate series of levers that lift three units a certain distance by lowering one unit by one unit distance, and we compare it with a simple lever which does the same thing and is fundamentally reversible, his machine will lift it no higher, but perhaps less high."
992,"If his machine is reversible, we also know exactly how high it will lift."
993,This is clearly a universal law of great utility.
994,"We set up three balls in a rack which does not move, as shown in Fig."
995,4–2.
996,One ball is held on a stage at a distance one foot above the ground.
997,"First we roll the balls horizontally from the rack to the shelves, (b), and we suppose that this takes no energy because we do not change the height."
998,Now we have ingeniously arranged the rack so that these balls are again even with the platforms.
999,"Thus we unload the balls onto the rack, (d); having unloaded the balls, we can restore the machine to its original condition."
1000,Now we have three balls on the upper three shelves and one at the bottom.
1001,"If we take all the weights and multiply them by the heights at which they are now, above the floor, let the machine operate, and then multiply all the weights by all the heights again, there will be no change."
1002,(We have to generalize the example where we moved only one weight to the case where when we lower one we lift several different ones—but that is easy.)
1003,"We call the sum of the weights times the heights gravitational potential energy—the energy which an object has because of its relationship in space, relative to the earth."
1004,The only problem is that perhaps it is not true.
1005,"(After all, nature does not have to go along with our reasoning.)"
1006,"For example, perhaps perpetual motion is, in fact, possible."
1007,"Some of the assumptions may be wrong, or we may have made a mistake in reasoning, so it is always necessary to check."
1008,"It turns out experimentally, in fact, to be true."
1009,The general name of energy which has to do with location relative to something else is called potential energy.
1010,"In this particular case, of course, we call it gravitational potential energy."
1011,"If it is a question of electrical forces against which we are working, instead of gravitational forces, if we are “lifting” charges away from other charges with a lot of levers, then the energy content is called electrical potential energy."
1012,The principle of the conservation of energy is very useful for deducing what will happen in a number of circumstances.
1013,In high school we learned a lot of laws about pulleys and levers used in different ways.
1014,"A simple example is a smooth inclined plane which is, happily, a three-four-five triangle (Fig."
1015,4–3).
1016,How can we figure that out?
1017,"If we say it is just balanced, it is reversible and so can move up and down, and we can consider the following situation."
1018,"Note that we deduced this from the conservation of energy, and not from force components."
1019,"Cleverness, however, is relative."
1020,"It can be deduced in a way which is even more brilliant, discovered by Stevinus and inscribed on his tombstone."
1021,"It is evident that the lower part of the chain is balanced by itself, so that the pull of the five weights on one side must balance the pull of three weights on the other, or whatever the ratio of the legs."
1022,"(If you get an epitaph like that on your gravestone, you are doing fine.)"
1023,"Let us now illustrate the energy principle with a more complicated problem, the screw jack shown in Fig."
1024,4–5.
1025,"If we want to lift the ton one inch, say, then we must turn the handle around ten times."
1026,This is a result of the conservation of energy.
1027,Take now the somewhat more complicated example shown in Fig.
1028,4–6.
1029,"How hard do we have to lift the end of the bar in order to keep it balanced, disregarding the weight of the bar?"
1030,Suppose we put a pulley at one end and hang a weight on the pulley.
1031,"In this way we can work out the laws of “balance”—the statics of complicated bridge arrangements, and so on."
1032,"This approach is called the principle of virtual work, because in order to apply this argument we had to imagine that the structure moves a little—even though it is not really moving or even movable."
1033,We use the very small imagined motion to apply the principle of conservation of energy.
1034,To illustrate another type of energy we consider a pendulum (Fig.
1035,4–7).
1036,"If we pull the mass aside and release it, it swings back and forth."
1037,"In its motion, it loses height in going from either end to the center."
1038,Where does the potential energy go?
1039,"Gravitational energy disappears when it is down at the bottom; nevertheless, it will climb up again."
1040,The gravitational energy must have gone into another form.
1041,"Evidently it is by virtue of its motion that it is able to climb up again, so we have the conversion of gravitational energy into some other form when it reaches the bottom."
1042,We must get a formula for the energy of motion.
1043,"Now, recalling our arguments about reversible machines, we can easily see that in the motion at the bottom must be a quantity of energy which permits it to rise a certain height, and which has nothing to do with the machinery by which it comes up or the path by which it comes up."
1044,So we have an equivalence formula something like the one we wrote for the child’s blocks.
1045,We have another form to represent the energy.
1046,It is easy to say what it is.
1047,What we need is the formula which tells us the height by some rule that has to do with the motion of objects.
1048,"If we start something out with a certain velocity, say straight up, it will reach a certain height; we do not know what it is yet, but it depends on the velocity—there is a formula for that."
1049,It makes no difference where the motion came from.
1050,This is a general formula for various velocities.
1051,"Both (4.3) and (4.6) are approximate formulas, the first because it is incorrect when the heights are great, i.e., when the heights are so high that gravity is weakening; the second, because of the relativistic correction at high speeds."
1052,"However, when we do finally get the exact formula for the energy, then the law of conservation of energy is correct."
1053,We can continue in this way to illustrate the existence of energy in other forms.
1054,"First, consider elastic energy."
1055,"If we pull down on a spring, we must do some work, for when we have it down, we can lift weights with it."
1056,Therefore in its stretched condition it has a possibility of doing some work.
1057,"If we were to evaluate the sums of weights times heights, it would not check out—we must add something else to account for the fact that the spring is under tension."
1058,Elastic energy is the formula for a spring when it is stretched.
1059,How much energy is it?
1060,"If we let go, the elastic energy, as the spring passes through the equilibrium point, is converted to kinetic energy and it goes back and forth between compressing or stretching the spring and kinetic energy of motion."
1061,"(There is also some gravitational energy going in and out, but we can do this experiment “sideways” if we like.)"
1062,It keeps going until the losses—Aha!
1063,"We have cheated all the way through by putting on little weights to move things or saying that the machines are reversible, or that they go on forever, but we can see that things do stop, eventually."
1064,Where is the energy when the spring has finished moving up and down?
1065,This brings in another form of energy: heat energy.
1066,"Inside a spring or a lever there are crystals which are made up of lots of atoms, and with great care and delicacy in the arrangement of the parts one can try to adjust things so that as something rolls on something else, none of the atoms do any jiggling at all."
1067,But one must be very careful.
1068,"Ordinarily when things roll, there is bumping and jiggling because of the irregularities of the material, and the atoms start to wiggle inside."
1069,So we lose track of that energy; we find the atoms are wiggling inside in a random and confused manner after the motion slows down.
1070,"There is still kinetic energy, all right, but it is not associated with visible motion."
1071,What a dream!
1072,How do we know there is still kinetic energy?
1073,"It turns out that with thermometers you can find out that, in fact, the spring or the lever is warmer, and that there is really an increase of kinetic energy by a definite amount."
1074,"We call this form of energy heat energy, but we know that it is not really a new form, it is just kinetic energy—internal motion."
1075,"(One of the difficulties with all these experiments with matter that we do on a large scale is that we cannot really demonstrate the conservation of energy and we cannot really make our reversible machines, because every time we move a large clump of stuff, the atoms do not remain absolutely undisturbed, and so a certain amount of random motion goes into the atomic system."
1076,"We cannot see it, but we can measure it with thermometers, etc.)"
1077,"There are many other forms of energy, and of course we cannot describe them in any more detail just now."
1078,"There is electrical energy, which has to do with pushing and pulling by electric charges."
1079,"There is radiant energy, the energy of light, which we know is a form of electrical energy because light can be represented as wigglings in the electromagnetic field."
1080,"There is chemical energy, the energy which is released in chemical reactions."
1081,"Actually, elastic energy is, to a certain extent, like chemical energy, because chemical energy is the energy of the attraction of the atoms, one for the other, and so is elastic energy."
1082,"Our modern understanding is the following: chemical energy has two parts, kinetic energy of the electrons inside the atoms, so part of it is kinetic, and electrical energy of interaction of the electrons and the protons—the rest of it, therefore, is electrical."
1083,"Next we come to nuclear energy, the energy which is involved with the arrangement of particles inside the nucleus, and we have formulas for that, but we do not have the fundamental laws."
1084,"We know that it is not electrical, not gravitational, and not purely kinetic, but we do not know what it is."
1085,It seems to be an additional form of energy.
1086,"Finally, associated with the relativity theory, there is a modification of the laws of kinetic energy, or whatever you wish to call it, so that kinetic energy is combined with another thing called mass energy."
1087,An object has energy from its sheer existence.
1088,"If I have a positron and an electron, standing still doing nothing—never mind gravity, never mind anything—and they come together and disappear, radiant energy will be liberated, in a definite amount, and the amount can be calculated."
1089,All we need know is the mass of the object.
1090,"It does not depend on what it is—we make two things disappear, and we get a certain amount of energy."
1091,"It is obvious from our discussion that the law of conservation of energy is enormously useful in making analyses, as we have illustrated in a few examples without knowing all the formulas."
1092,"If we had all the formulas for all kinds of energy, we could analyze how many processes should work without having to go into the details."
1093,Therefore conservation laws are very interesting.
1094,The question naturally arises as to what other conservation laws there are in physics.
1095,There are two other conservation laws which are analogous to the conservation of energy.
1096,One is called the conservation of linear momentum.
1097,The other is called the conservation of angular momentum.
1098,We will find out more about these later.
1099,"In the last analysis, we do not understand the conservation laws deeply."
1100,We do not understand the conservation of energy.
1101,We do not understand energy as a certain number of little blobs.
1102,You may have heard that photons come out in blobs and that the energy of a photon is Planck’s constant times the frequency.
1103,"That is true, but since the frequency of light can be anything, there is no law that says that energy has to be a certain definite amount."
1104,"Unlike Dennis’ blocks, there can be any amount of energy, at least as presently understood."
1105,"So we do not understand this energy as counting something at the moment, but just as a mathematical quantity, which is an abstract and rather peculiar circumstance."
1106,"In quantum mechanics it turns out that the conservation of energy is very closely related to another important property of the world, things do not depend on the absolute time."
1107,"We can set up an experiment at a given moment and try it out, and then do the same experiment at a later moment, and it will behave in exactly the same way."
1108,"Whether this is strictly true or not, we do not know."
1109,"If we assume that it is true, and add the principles of quantum mechanics, then we can deduce the principle of the conservation of energy."
1110,"It is a rather subtle and interesting thing, and it is not easy to explain."
1111,The other conservation laws are also linked together.
1112,"The conservation of momentum is associated in quantum mechanics with the proposition that it makes no difference where you do the experiment, the results will always be the same."
1113,"As independence in space has to do with the conservation of momentum, independence of time has to do with the conservation of energy, and finally, if we turn our apparatus, this too makes no difference, and so the invariance of the world to angular orientation is related to the conservation of angular momentum."
1114,"Besides these, there are three other conservation laws, that are exact so far as we can tell today, which are much simpler to understand because they are in the nature of counting blocks."
1115,"The first of the three is the conservation of charge, and that merely means that you count how many positive, minus how many negative electrical charges you have, and the number is never changed."
1116,"You may get rid of a positive with a negative, but you do not create any net excess of positives over negatives."
1117,Two other laws are analogous to this one—one is called the conservation of baryons.
1118,"There are a number of strange particles, a neutron and a proton are examples, which are called baryons."
1119,"In any reaction whatever in nature, if we count how many baryons are coming into a process, the number of baryons2 which come out will be exactly the same."
1120,"There is another law, the conservation of leptons."
1121,"We can say that the group of particles called leptons are: electron, muon, and neutrino."
1122,"Counting the total number of leptons in a reaction reveals that the number in and out never changes, at least so far as we know at present."
1123,"These are the six conservation laws, three of them subtle, involving space and time, and three of them simple, in the sense of counting something."
1124,"With regard to the conservation of energy, we should note that available energy is another matter—there is a lot of jiggling around in the atoms of the water of the sea, because the sea has a certain temperature, but it is impossible to get them herded into a definite motion without taking energy from somewhere else."
1125,"That is, although we know for a fact that energy is conserved, the energy available for human utility is not conserved so easily."
1126,The laws which govern how much energy is available are called the laws of thermodynamics and involve a concept called entropy for irreversible thermodynamic processes.
1127,"Finally, we remark on the question of where we can get our supplies of energy today."
1128,"Our supplies of energy are from the sun, rain, coal, uranium, and hydrogen."
1129,"The sun makes the rain, and the coal also, so that all these are from the sun."
1130,"Although energy is conserved, nature does not seem to be interested in it; she liberates a lot of energy from the sun, but only one part in two billion falls on the earth."
1131,"Nature has conservation of energy, but does not really care; she spends a lot of it in all directions."
1132,"We have already obtained energy from uranium; we can also get energy from hydrogen, but at present only in an explosive and dangerous condition."
1133,Therefore it is up to the physicist to figure out how to liberate us from the need for having energy.
1134,It can be done.
1135,(There was no summary for this lecture.)
1136,In this chapter we shall consider some aspects of the concepts of time and distance.
1137,"It has been emphasized earlier that physics, as do all the sciences, depends on observation."
1138,One might also say that the development of the physical sciences to their present form has depended to a large extent on the emphasis which has been placed on the making of quantitative observations.
1139,"Only with quantitative observations can one arrive at quantitative relationships, which are the heart of physics."
1140,"Many people would like to place the beginnings of physics with the work done 350 years ago by Galileo, and to call him the first physicist."
1141,"Until that time, the study of motion had been a philosophical one based on arguments that could be thought up in one’s head."
1142,"Most of the arguments had been presented by Aristotle and other Greek philosophers, and were taken as “proven.” Galileo was skeptical, and did an experiment on motion which was essentially this: He allowed a ball to roll down an inclined trough and observed the motion."
1143,"He did not, however, just look; he measured how far the ball went in how long a time."
1144,"The way to measure a distance was well known long before Galileo, but there were no accurate ways of measuring time, particularly short times."
1145,"Although he later devised more satisfactory clocks (though not like the ones we know), Galileo’s first experiments on motion were done by using his pulse to count off equal intervals of time."
1146,Let us do the same.
1147,"We may count off beats of a pulse as the ball rolls down the track: “one … two … three … four … five … six … seven … eight …” We ask a friend to make a small mark at the location of the ball at each count; we can then measure the distance the ball travelled from the point of release in one, or two, or three, etc., equal intervals of time."
1148,"The study of motion, which is basic to all of physics, treats with the questions: where?"
1149,and when?
1150,Let us consider first what we mean by time.
1151,What is time?
1152,It would be nice if we could find a good definition of time.
1153,"Webster defines “a time” as “a period,” and the latter as “a time,” which doesn’t seem to be very useful."
1154,Perhaps we should say: “Time is what happens when nothing else happens.” Which also doesn’t get us very far.
1155,"Maybe it is just as well if we face the fact that time is one of the things we probably cannot define (in the dictionary sense), and just say that it is what we already know it to be: it is how long we wait!"
1156,"What really matters anyway is not how we define time, but how we measure it."
1157,One way of measuring time is to utilize something which happens over and over again in a regular fashion—something which is periodic.
1158,"For example, a day."
1159,A day seems to happen over and over again.
1160,"But when you begin to think about it, you might well ask: “Are days periodic; are they regular?"
1161,Are all days the same length?” One certainly has the impression that days in summer are longer than days in winter.
1162,"Of course, some of the days in winter seem to get awfully long if one is very bored."
1163,"You have certainly heard someone say, “My, but this has been a long day!”"
1164,"It does seem, however, that days are about the same length on the average."
1165,"Is there any way we can test whether the days are the same length—either from one day to the next, or at least on the average?"
1166,One way is to make a comparison with some other periodic phenomenon.
1167,Let us see how such a comparison might be made with an hour glass.
1168,"With an hour glass, we can “create” a periodic occurrence if we have someone standing by it day and night to turn it over whenever the last grain of sand runs out."
1169,We could then count the turnings of the glass from each morning to the next.
1170,"We would find, this time, that the number of “hours” (i.e., turnings of the glass) was not the same each “day.” We should distrust the sun, or the glass, or both."
1171,"After some thought, it might occur to us to count the “hours” from noon to noon."
1172,"(Noon is here defined not as 12:00 o’clock, but that instant when the sun is at its highest point.)"
1173,"We would find, this time, that the number of “hours” each day is the same."
1174,"We now have some confidence that both the “hour” and the “day” have a regular periodicity, i.e., mark off successive equal intervals of time, although we have not proved that either one is “really” periodic."
1175,Someone might question whether there might not be some omnipotent being who would slow down the flow of sand every night and speed it up during the day.
1176,"Our experiment does not, of course, give us an answer to this sort of question."
1177,All we can say is that we find that a regularity of one kind fits together with a regularity of another kind.
1178,We can just say that we base our definition of time on the repetition of some apparently periodic event.
1179,"We should now notice that in the process of checking on the reproducibility of the day, we have received an important by-product."
1180,"We have found a way of measuring, more accurately, fractions of a day."
1181,We have found a way of counting time in smaller pieces.
1182,"Can we carry the process further, and learn to measure even smaller intervals of time?"
1183,Galileo decided that a given pendulum always swings back and forth in equal intervals of time so long as the size of the swing is kept small.
1184,A test comparing the number of swings of a pendulum in one “hour” shows that such is indeed the case.
1185,We can in this way mark fractions of an hour.
1186,If we use a mechanical device to count the swings—and to keep them going—we have the pendulum clock of our grandfathers.
1187,We can apply the same principles to divide the second into smaller and smaller intervals.
1188,"It is, you will realize, not practical to make mechanical pendulums which go arbitrarily fast, but we can now make electrical pendulums, called oscillators, which can provide a periodic occurrence with a very short period of swing."
1189,"In these electronic oscillators it is an electrical current which swings to and fro, in a manner analogous to the swinging of the bob of the pendulum."
1190,We may “calibrate” each oscillator against the next slower one by counting the number of swings it makes for one swing of the slower oscillator.
1191,"When the period of oscillation of our clock is shorter than a fraction of a second, we cannot count the oscillations without the help of some device which extends our powers of observation."
1192,"One such device is the electron-beam oscilloscope, which acts as a sort of microscope for short times."
1193,This device plots on a fluorescent screen a graph of electrical current (or voltage) versus time.
1194,"By connecting the oscilloscope to two of our oscillators in sequence, so that it plots a graph first of the current in one of our oscillators and then of the current in the other, we get two graphs like those shown in Fig."
1195,5–2.
1196,We can readily determine the number of periods of the faster oscillator in one period of the slower oscillator.
1197,"In effect, a different definition of “time” has been used."
1198,One way has been to observe the distance between two happenings on a moving object.
1199,"If, for example, the headlights of a moving automobile are turned on and then off, we can figure out how long the lights were on if we know where they were turned on and off and how fast the car was moving."
1200,The time is the distance over which the lights were on divided by the speed.
1201,It should be emphasized that we have here used a somewhat different definition of “time” than before.
1202,"So long as there are no inconsistencies in our understanding, however, we feel fairly confident that our definitions are sufficiently equivalent."
1203,By extending our techniques—and if necessary our definitions—still further we can infer the time duration of still faster physical events.
1204,We can speak of the period of a nuclear vibration.
1205,We can speak of the lifetime of the newly discovered strange resonances (particles) mentioned in Chapter 2.
1206,What about still smaller times?
1207,Does “time” exist on a still smaller scale?
1208,Does it make any sense to speak of smaller times if we cannot measure—or perhaps even think sensibly about—something which happens in a shorter time?
1209,Perhaps not.
1210,These are some of the open questions which you will be asking and perhaps answering in the next twenty or thirty years.
1211,Let us now consider times longer than one day.
1212,Measurement of longer times is easy; we just count the days—so long as there is someone around to do the counting.
1213,"We have also discovered that nature has sometimes provided a counter for the years, in the form of tree rings or river-bottom sediments."
1214,In some cases we can use these natural time markers to determine the time which has passed since some early event.
1215,"When we cannot count the years for the measurement of long times, we must look for other ways to measure."
1216,"One of the most successful is the use of radioactive material as a “clock.” In this case we do not have a periodic occurrence, as for the day or the pendulum, but a new kind of “regularity.” We find that the radioactivity of a particular sample of material decreases by the same fraction for successive equal increases in its age."
1217,"If we plot a graph of the radioactivity observed as a function of time (say in days), we obtain a curve like that shown in Fig."
1218,5–3.
1219,"There are, fortunately, cases in which we can know the amount of radioactivity that was in an object when it was formed."
1220,"We would like to know, and we think we do know, the life of still older things."
1221,Much of our knowledge is based on the measurements of other radioactive isotopes which have different half-lives.
1222,"If we make measurements with an isotope with a longer half-life, then we are able to measure longer times."
1223,"When the uranium disintegrates, it changes into lead."
1224,Consider a piece of rock which was formed a long time ago in some chemical process.
1225,"Lead, being of a chemical nature different from uranium, would appear in one part of the rock and uranium would appear in another part of the rock."
1226,The uranium and lead would be separate.
1227,"If we look at that piece of rock today, where there should only be uranium we will now find a certain fraction of uranium and a certain fraction of lead."
1228,"By comparing these fractions, we can tell what percent of the uranium disappeared and changed into lead."
1229,"By this method, the age of certain rocks has been determined to be several billion years."
1230,"It is encouraging that the age of the earth is found to be the same as the age of the meteorites which land on the earth, as determined by the uranium method."
1231,"It appears that the earth was formed out of rocks floating in space, and that the meteorites are, quite likely, some of that material left over."
1232,"At some time more than five billion years ago, the universe started."
1233,It is now believed that at least our part of the universe had its beginning about ten or twelve billion years ago.
1234,We do not know what happened before then.
1235,"In fact, we may well ask again: Does the question make any sense?"
1236,Does an earlier time have any meaning?
1237,"We have implied that it is convenient if we start with some standard unit of time, say a day or a second, and refer all other times to some multiple or fraction of this unit."
1238,What shall we take as our basic standard of time?
1239,Shall we take the human pulse?
1240,"If we compare pulses, we find that they seem to vary a lot."
1241,"On comparing two clocks, one finds they do not vary so much."
1242,"You might then say, well, let us take a clock."
1243,But whose clock?
1244,There is a story of a Swiss boy who wanted all of the clocks in his town to ring noon at the same time.
1245,So he went around trying to convince everyone of the value of this.
1246,Everyone thought it was a marvelous idea so long as all of the other clocks rang noon when his did!
1247,It is rather difficult to decide whose clock we should take as a standard.
1248,"Fortunately, we all share one clock—the earth."
1249,For a long time the rotational period of the earth has been taken as the basic standard of time.
1250,"As measurements have been made more and more precise, however, it has been found that the rotation of the earth is not exactly periodic, when measured in terms of the best clocks."
1251,These “best” clocks are those which we have reason to believe are accurate because they agree with each other.
1252,"We now believe that, for various reasons, some days are longer than others, some days are shorter, and on the average the period of the earth becomes a little longer as the centuries pass."
1253,"Recently we have been gaining experience with some natural oscillators which we now believe would provide a more constant time reference than the earth, and which are also based on a natural phenomenon available to everyone."
1254,These are the so-called “atomic clocks.” Their basic internal period is that of an atomic vibration which is very insensitive to the temperature or any other external effects.
1255,Within the past two years an improved atomic clock which operates on the vibration of the hydrogen atom has been designed and built by Professor Norman Ramsey at Harvard University.
1256,Measurements now in progress will show whether this is true or not.
1257,"We may expect that since it has been possible to build clocks much more accurate than astronomical time, there will soon be an agreement among scientists to define the unit of time in terms of one of the atomic clock standards."
1258,Let us now turn to the question of distance.
1259,"How far, or how big, are things?"
1260,Everybody knows that the way you measure distance is to start with a stick and count.
1261,Or start with a thumb and count.
1262,You begin with a unit and count.
1263,How does one measure smaller things?
1264,How does one subdivide distance?
1265,In the same way that we subdivided time: we take a smaller unit and count the number of such units it takes to make up the longer unit.
1266,So we can measure smaller and smaller lengths.
1267,But we do not always mean by distance what one gets by counting off with a meter stick.
1268,It would be difficult to measure the horizontal distance between two mountain tops using only a meter stick.
1269,We have found by experience that distance can be measured in another fashion: by triangulation.
1270,"Although this means that we are really using a different definition of distance, when they can both be used they agree with each other."
1271,"Space is more or less what Euclid thought it was, so the two types of definitions of distance agree."
1272,Since they do agree on the earth it gives us some confidence in using triangulation for still larger distances.
1273,"For example, we were able to use triangulation to measure the height of the first Sputnik."
1274,By more careful measurements the distance to the moon can be measured in the same way.
1275,Two telescopes at different places on the earth can give us the two angles we need.
1276,"We cannot do the same with the sun, or at least no one has been able to yet."
1277,The accuracy with which one can focus on a given point on the sun and with which one can measure angles is not good enough to permit us to measure the distance to the sun.
1278,Then how can we measure the distance to the sun?
1279,We must invent an extension of the idea of triangulation.
1280,"We measure the relative distances of all the planets by astronomical observations of where the planets appear to be, and we get a picture of the solar system with the proper relative distances of everything, but with no absolute distance."
1281,"One absolute measurement is then required, which has been obtained in a number of ways."
1282,"One of the ways, which was believed until recently to be the most accurate, was to measure the distance from the earth to Eros, one of the small planetoids which passes near the earth every now and then."
1283,"By triangulation on this little object, one could get the one required scale measurement."
1284,"Knowing the relative distances of the rest, we can then tell the distance, for example, from the earth to the sun, or from the earth to Pluto."
1285,Within the past year there has been a big improvement in our knowledge of the scale of the solar system.
1286,At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory the distance from the earth to Venus was measured quite accurately by a direct radar observation.
1287,"This, of course, is a still different type of inferred distance."
1288,"We say we know the speed at which light travels (and therefore, at which radar waves travel), and we assume that it is the same speed everywhere between the earth and Venus."
1289,"We send the radio wave out, and count the time until the reflected wave comes back."
1290,"From the time we infer a distance, assuming we know the speed."
1291,We have really another definition of a measurement of distance.
1292,"How do we measure the distance to a star, which is much farther away?"
1293,"Fortunately, we can go back to our triangulation method, because the earth moving around the sun gives us a large baseline for measurements of objects outside the solar system."
1294,"If we focus a telescope on a star in summer and in winter, we might hope to determine these two angles accurately enough to be able to measure the distance to a star."
1295,What if the stars are too far away for us to use triangulation?
1296,Astronomers are always inventing new ways of measuring distance.
1297,"They find, for example, that they can estimate the size and brightness of a star by its color."
1298,"The color and brightness of many nearby stars—whose distances are known by triangulation—have been measured, and it is found that there is a smooth relationship between the color and the intrinsic brightness of stars (in most cases)."
1299,"If one now measures the color of a distant star, one may use the color-brightness relationship to determine the intrinsic brightness of the star."
1300,"By measuring how bright the star appears to us at the earth (or perhaps we should say how dim it appears), we can compute how far away it is."
1301,"(For a given intrinsic brightness, the apparent brightness decreases with the square of the distance.)"
1302,A nice confirmation of the correctness of this method of measuring stellar distances is given by the results obtained for groups of stars known as globular clusters.
1303,A photograph of such a group is shown in Fig.
1304,5–6.
1305,Just from looking at the photograph one is convinced that these stars are all together.
1306,The same result is obtained from distance measurements by the color-brightness method.
1307,A study of many globular clusters gives another important bit of information.
1308,It is found that there is a high concentration of such clusters in a certain part of the sky and that most of them are about the same distance from us.
1309,"Coupling this information with other evidence, we conclude that this concentration of clusters marks the center of our galaxy."
1310,"Knowing the size of our own galaxy, we have a key to the measurement of still larger distances—the distances to other galaxies."
1311,"Figure 5–7 is a photograph of a galaxy, which has much the same shape as our own."
1312,"Probably it is the same size, too."
1313,(Other evidence supports the idea that galaxies are all about the same size.)
1314,"If it is the same size as ours, we can tell its distance."
1315,"We measure the angle it subtends in the sky; we know its diameter, and we compute its distance—triangulation again!"
1316,Photographs of exceedingly distant galaxies have recently been obtained with the giant Palomar telescope.
1317,One is shown in Fig.
1318,5–8.
1319,Now let’s think about smaller distances.
1320,Subdividing the meter is easy.
1321,Without much difficulty we can mark off one thousand equal spaces which add up to one meter.
1322,"With somewhat more difficulty, but in a similar way (using a good microscope), we can mark off a thousand equal subdivisions of the millimeter to make a scale of microns (millionths of a meter)."
1323,"We need not stop, however, at what we can see."
1324,5–9).
1325,By indirect measurements—by a kind of triangulation on a microscopic scale—we can continue to measure to smaller and smaller scales.
1326,"First, from an observation of the way light of short wavelength (x-radiation) is reflected from a pattern of marks of known separation, we determine the wavelength of the light vibrations."
1327,"Then, from the pattern of the scattering of the same light from a crystal, we can determine the relative location of the atoms in the crystal, obtaining results which agree with the atomic spacings also determined by chemical means."
1328,"For nuclear sizes, a different way of measuring size becomes convenient."
1329,Measurement of a nuclear cross section can be made by passing a beam of high-energy particles through a thin slab of material and observing the number of particles which do not get through.
1330,These high-energy particles will plow right through the thin cloud of electrons and will be stopped or deflected only if they hit the concentrated weight of a nucleus.
1331,But the nuclei are so small that there is little chance that any nucleus will lie behind another.
1332,We might imagine that a highly magnified view of the situation—looking along the particle beam—would look like Fig.
1333,5–10.
1334,The chance that a very small particle will hit a nucleus on the trip through is just the total area covered by the profiles of the nuclei divided by the total area in the picture.
1335,What do we find if we go to smaller distances?
1336,Can we measure smaller distances?
1337,Such questions are not yet answerable.
1338,"It has been suggested that the still unsolved mystery of nuclear forces may be unravelled only by some modification of our idea of space, or measurement, at such small distances."
1339,It might be thought that it would be a good idea to use some natural length as our unit of length—say the radius of the earth or some fraction of it.
1340,It is neither convenient nor very accurate to determine the unit of length in this way.
1341,For a long time it has been agreed internationally that the meter would be defined as the distance between two scratches on a bar kept in a special laboratory in France.
1342,"More recently, it has been realized that this definition is neither as precise as would be useful, nor as permanent or universal as one would like."
1343,"It is currently being considered that a new definition be adopted, an agreed-upon (arbitrary) number of wavelengths of a chosen spectral line."
1344,Measurements of distance and of time give results which depend on the observer.
1345,Two observers moving with respect to each other will not measure the same distances and times when measuring what appear to be the same things.
1346,"Distances and time intervals have different magnitudes, depending on the coordinate system (or “frame of reference”) used for making the measurements."
1347,We shall study this subject in more detail in a later chapter.
1348,Perfectly precise measurements of distances or times are not permitted by the laws of nature.
1349,It was also mentioned that the uncertainty in position measurements is related to the wave nature of particles.
1350,"If we wish to know more precisely when something happened we must know less about what happened, because our knowledge of the energy involved will be less."
1351,The time uncertainty is also related to the wave nature of matter.
1352,(There was no summary for this lecture.)
1353,“The true logic of this world is in the calculus of probabilities.”   —James Clerk Maxwell
1354,“Chance” is a word which is in common use in everyday living.
1355,The radio reports speaking of tomorrow’s weather may say: “There is a sixty percent chance of rain.” You might say: “There is a small chance that I shall live to be one hundred years old.” Scientists also use the word chance.
1356,A seismologist may be interested in the question: “What is the chance that there will be an earthquake of a certain size in Southern California next year?” A physicist might ask the question: “What is the chance that a particular geiger counter will register twenty counts in the next ten seconds?” A politician or statesman might be interested in the question: “What is the chance that there will be a nuclear war within the next ten years?” You may be interested in the chance that you will learn something from this chapter.
1357,"By chance, we mean something like a guess."
1358,Why do we make guesses?
1359,We make guesses when we wish to make a judgment but have incomplete information or uncertain knowledge.
1360,"We want to make a guess as to what things are, or what things are likely to happen."
1361,Often we wish to make a guess because we have to make a decision.
1362,For example: Shall I take my raincoat with me tomorrow?
1363,For what earth movement should I design a new building?
1364,Shall I build myself a fallout shelter?
1365,Shall I change my stand in international negotiations?
1366,Shall I go to class today?
1367,"Sometimes we make guesses because we wish, with our limited knowledge, to say as much as we can about some situation."
1368,"Really, any generalization is in the nature of a guess."
1369,Any physical theory is a kind of guesswork.
1370,There are good guesses and there are bad guesses.
1371,The theory of probability is a system for making better guesses.
1372,"The language of probability allows us to speak quantitatively about some situation which may be highly variable, but which does have some consistent average behavior."
1373,Let us consider the flipping of a coin.
1374,"If the toss—and the coin—are “honest,” we have no way of knowing what to expect for the outcome of any particular toss."
1375,Yet we would feel that in a large number of tosses there should be about equal numbers of heads and tails.
1376,We speak of probability only for observations that we contemplate being made in the future.
1377,By the “probability” of a particular outcome of an observation we mean our estimate for the most likely fraction of a number of repeated observations that will yield that particular outcome.
1378,Our definition requires several comments.
1379,"First of all, we may speak of a probability of something happening only if the occurrence is a possible outcome of some repeatable observation."
1380,It is not clear that it would make any sense to ask: “What is the probability that there is a ghost in that house?”
1381,You may object that no situation is exactly repeatable.
1382,That is right.
1383,Every different observation must at least be at a different time or place.
1384,"All we can say is that the “repeated” observations should, for our intended purposes, appear to be equivalent."
1385,"We should assume, at least, that each observation was made from an equivalently prepared situation, and especially with the same degree of ignorance at the start."
1386,"(If we sneak a look at an opponent’s hand in a card game, our estimate of our chances of winning are different than if we do not!)"
1387,(6.1) are not intended to represent numbers based on actual observations.
1388,"Probability depends, therefore, on our knowledge and on our ability to make estimates."
1389,"In effect, on our common sense!"
1390,"Fortunately, there is a certain amount of agreement in the common sense of many things, so that different people will make the same estimate."
1391,"Probabilities need not, however, be “absolute” numbers."
1392,"Since they depend on our ignorance, they may become different if our knowledge changes."
1393,You may have noticed another rather “subjective” aspect of our definition of probability.
1394,"(We are assuming that every toss gives either heads or tails, and no “other” result!)"
1395,"But if the coin is “honest,” there is no preference for heads or tails."
1396,"Until we have some reason to think the coin (or toss) is dishonest, we must give equal likelihoods for heads and tails."
1397,"In Chapter 5 we described the size of a nucleus in terms of its apparent area, or “cross section.” When we did so we were really talking about probabilities."
1398,"When we shoot a high-energy particle at a thin slab of material, there is some chance that it will pass right through and some chance that it will hit a nucleus."
1399,"(Since the nucleus is so small that we cannot see it, we cannot aim right at a nucleus."
1400,The sequences of “heads” and “tails” are shown just as they were obtained.
1401,Should we begin to suspect the coin?
1402,The results of the experiments are given in Table 6–1.1
1403,We can get a better feeling for the details of these results if we plot a graph of the distribution of the results.
1404,Such a graph is shown in Fig.
1405,6–2.
1406,Are we to conclude that there is some bias toward heads?
1407,Was our “best estimate” not good enough?
1408,But wait!
1409,"There are two ways of obtaining one head, but only one of obtaining either zero or two heads."
1410,The third toss is equally likely to be heads or tails.
1411,We could throw tails after having thrown two heads (one way) or we could throw heads after throwing only one head in the first two tosses (two ways).
1412,The argument we have been making can be summarized by a diagram like that in Fig.
1413,6–3.
1414,It is clear how the diagram should be continued for games with a larger number of tosses.
1415,The number of “ways” to any point on the diagram is just the number of different “paths” (sequences of heads and tails) which can be taken from the starting point.
1416,The vertical position gives us the total number of heads thrown.
1417,The set of numbers which appears in such a diagram is known as Pascal’s triangle.
1418,(6.1).
1419,The dashed curve in Fig.
1420,Such fluctuations are “part of the game.”
1421,The method we have just used can be applied to the most general situation in which there are only two possible outcomes of a single observation.
1422,There is another interesting problem in which the idea of probability is required.
1423,"The choice is to be made randomly, determined, for example, by the toss of a coin."
1424,How shall we describe the resulting motion?
1425,In its general form the problem is related to the motion of atoms (or other particles) in a gas—called Brownian motion—and also to the combination of errors in measurements.
1426,You will see that the random-walk problem is closely related to the coin-tossing problem we have already discussed.
1427,"First, let us look at a few examples of a random walk."
1428,We show in the graph of Fig.
1429,6–5 three examples of the path of a random walker.
1430,(We have used for the random sequence of choices the results of the coin tosses shown in Fig.
1431,6–1.)
1432,What can we say about such a motion?
1433,"We might first ask: “How far does he get on the average?” We must expect that his average progress will be zero, since he is equally likely to go either forward or backward."
1434,"By “expected value” we mean the probable value (our best guess), which we can think of as the expected average behavior in many repeated sequences."
1435,(All distances will be measured in terms of a unit of one step.
1436,We shall not continue to write the units of distance.)
1437,We have pointed out that the random walk is closely similar in its mathematics to the coin-tossing game we considered at the beginning of the chapter.
1438,(6.5).
1439,The graph of Fig.
1440,).
1441,We see that the “width” of the curve in Fig.
1442,We are now in a position to consider a question we have avoided until now.
1443,How shall we tell whether a coin is “honest” or “loaded”?
1444,We can give now at least a partial answer.
1445,In Fig.
1446,"Unfortunately, for any given run or combination of runs there is no guarantee that the observed deviation will be even near the expected deviation."
1447,There is always the finite chance that a large fluctuation—a long string of heads or tails—will give an arbitrarily large deviation.
1448,"If it is much larger, we may be suspicious, but cannot prove, that the coin is loaded (or that the tosser is clever!"
1449,).
1450,We have also not considered how we should treat the case of a “coin” or some similar “chancy” object (say a stone that always lands in either of two positions) that we have good reason to believe should have a different probability for heads and tails.
1451,"In some cases, the best we can do is to observe the number of heads obtained in large numbers of tosses."
1452,(How could we expect anything else?)
1453,"There is, however, no way to make such thinking logically consistent."
1454,"It is probably better to realize that the probability concept is in a sense subjective, that it is always based on uncertain knowledge, and that its quantitative evaluation is subject to change as we obtain more information."
1455,Let us return now to the random walk and consider a modification of it.
1456,This case is more representative of something like the thermal motion of a molecule in a gas.
1457,The answer is zero!
1458,We cannot plot a graph like that of Fig.
1459,6–2.
1460,"We can, however, obtain a representation similar to that of Fig."
1461,6–7.
1462,This comes about because the curves are all of a similar shape and their areas under the curves must all be equal.
1463,6–8.
1464,The probability density function we have been describing is one that is encountered most commonly.
1465,It is known as the normal or Gaussian probability density.
1466,"We remarked earlier that the motion of a molecule, or of any particle, in a gas is like a random walk."
1467,Suppose we open a bottle of an organic compound and let some of its vapor escape into the air.
1468,"If there are air currents, so that the air is circulating, the currents will also carry the vapor with them."
1469,"But even in perfectly still air, the vapor will gradually spread out—will diffuse—until it has penetrated throughout the room."
1470,We might detect it by its color or odor.
1471,The individual molecules of the organic vapor spread out in still air because of the molecular motions caused by collisions with other molecules.
1472,"If we know the average “step” size, and the number of steps taken per second, we can find the probability that one, or several, molecules will be found at some distance from their starting point after any particular passage of time."
1473,"As time passes, more steps are taken and the gas spreads out as in the successive curves of Fig."
1474,6–7.
1475,"In a later chapter, we shall find out how the step sizes and step frequencies are related to the temperature and pressure of a gas."
1476,"Earlier, we said that the pressure of a gas is due to the molecules bouncing against the walls of the container."
1477,"When we come later to make a more quantitative description, we will wish to know how fast the molecules are going when they bounce, since the impact they make will depend on that speed."
1478,"We cannot, however, speak of the speed of the molecules."
1479,It is necessary to use a probability description.
1480,"A molecule may have any speed, but some speeds are more likely than others."
1481,6–9.
1482,We often think of the curve of Fig.
1483,6–9 in a somewhat different way.
1484,"When probability was first applied to such problems, it was considered to be a convenience—a way of dealing with very complex situations."
1485,We now believe that the ideas of probability are essential to a description of atomic happenings.
1486,"According to quantum mechanics, the mathematical theory of particles, there is always some uncertainty in the specification of positions and velocities."
1487,6–10(a).
1488,Since the right-hand side of Eq.
1489,"(6.22) is a constant, this equation says that if we try to “pin down” a particle by forcing it to be at a particular place, it ends up by having a high speed."
1490,"Or if we try to force it to go very slowly, or at a precise velocity, it “spreads out” so that we do not know very well just where it is."
1491,Particles behave in a funny way!
1492,The uncertainty principle describes an inherent fuzziness that must exist in any attempt to describe nature.
1493,Our most precise description of nature must be in terms of probabilities.
1494,There are some people who do not like this way of describing nature.
1495,"They feel somehow that if they could only tell what is really going on with a particle, they could know its speed and position simultaneously."
1496,"In the early days of the development of quantum mechanics, Einstein was quite worried about this problem."
1497,"He used to shake his head and say, “But, surely God does not throw dice in determining how electrons should go!” He worried about that problem for a long time and he probably never really reconciled himself to the fact that this is the best description of nature that one can give."
1498,There are still one or two physicists who are working on the problem who have an intuitive conviction that it is possible somehow to describe the world in a different way and that all of this uncertainty about the way things are can be removed.
1499,No one has yet been successful.
1500,The necessary uncertainty in our specification of the position of a particle becomes most important when we wish to describe the structure of atoms.
1501,"In the hydrogen atom, which has a nucleus of one proton with one electron outside of the nucleus, the uncertainty in the position of the electron is as large as the atom itself!"
1502,"We cannot, therefore, properly speak of the electron moving in some “orbit” around the proton."
1503,We can form an image of the hydrogen atom by imagining a “cloud” whose density is proportional to the probability density for observing the electron.
1504,A sample of such a cloud is shown in Fig.
1505,6–11.
1506,Thus our best “picture” of a hydrogen atom is a nucleus surrounded by an “electron cloud” (although we really mean a “probability cloud”).
1507,"The electron is there somewhere, but nature permits us to know only the chance of finding it at any particular place."
1508,"In its efforts to learn as much as possible about nature, modern physics has found that certain things can never be “known” with certainty."
1509,Much of our knowledge must always remain uncertain.
1510,The most we can know is in terms of probabilities.
1511,In this chapter we shall discuss one of the most far-reaching generalizations of the human mind.
1512,"While we are admiring the human mind, we should take some time off to stand in awe of a nature that could follow with such completeness and generality such an elegantly simple principle as the law of gravitation."
1513,What is this law of gravitation?
1514,It is that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force which for any two bodies is proportional to the mass of each and varies inversely as the square of the distance between them.
1515,"However, since you are not assumed to be sufficiently talented yet, we shall discuss the consequences in more detail, and not just leave you with only these two bare principles."
1516,"We shall briefly relate the story of the discovery of the law of gravitation and discuss some of its consequences, its effects on history, the mysteries that such a law entails, and some refinements of the law made by Einstein; we shall also discuss the relationships of the law to the other laws of physics."
1517,"All this cannot be done in one chapter, but these subjects will be treated in due time in subsequent chapters."
1518,"The story begins with the ancients observing the motions of planets among the stars, and finally deducing that they went around the sun, a fact that was rediscovered later by Copernicus."
1519,"Exactly how the planets went around the sun, with exactly what motion, took a little more work to discover."
1520,Beginning in the sixteenth century there were great debates as to whether they really went around the sun or not.
1521,Tycho Brahe had an idea that was different from anything proposed by the ancients: his idea was that these debates about the nature of the motions of the planets would best be resolved if the actual positions of the planets in the sky were measured sufficiently accurately.
1522,"If measurement showed exactly how the planets moved, then perhaps it would be possible to establish one or another viewpoint."
1523,"This was a tremendous idea—that to find something out, it is better to perform some careful experiments than to carry on deep philosophical arguments."
1524,"Pursuing this idea, Tycho Brahe studied the positions of the planets for many years in his observatory on the island of Hven, near Copenhagen."
1525,"He made voluminous tables, which were then studied by the mathematician Kepler, after Tycho’s death."
1526,"Kepler discovered from the data some very beautiful and remarkable, but simple, laws regarding planetary motion."
1527,"First of all, Kepler found that each planet goes around the sun in a curve called an ellipse, with the sun at a focus of the ellipse."
1528,"An ellipse is not just an oval, but is a very specific and precise curve that can be obtained by using two tacks, one at each focus, a loop of string, and a pencil; more mathematically, it is the locus of all points the sum of whose distances from two fixed points (the foci) is a constant."
1529,"Or, if you will, it is a foreshortened circle (Fig."
1530,7–1).
1531,"Kepler’s second observation was that the planets do not go around the sun at a uniform speed, but move faster when they are nearer the sun and more slowly when they are farther from the sun, in precisely this way: Suppose a planet is observed at any two successive times, let us say a week apart, and that the radius vector1 is drawn to the planet for each observed position."
1532,"The orbital arc traversed by the planet during the week, and the two radius vectors, bound a certain plane area, the shaded area shown in Fig."
1533,7–2.
1534,"If two similar observations are made a week apart, at a part of the orbit farther from the sun (where the planet moves more slowly), the similarly bounded area is exactly the same as in the first case."
1535,"So, in accordance with the second law, the orbital speed of each planet is such that the radius “sweeps out” equal areas in equal times."
1536,"Finally, a third law was discovered by Kepler much later; this law is of a different category from the other two, because it deals not with only a single planet, but relates one planet to another."
1537,"In this statement the period is the time interval it takes a planet to go completely around its orbit, and the size is measured by the length of the greatest diameter of the elliptical orbit, technically known as the major axis."
1538,"Thus Kepler’s three laws are: 
         Each planet moves around the sun in an ellipse, with the sun         at one focus."
1539,The radius vector from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal         areas in equal intervals of time.
1540,"While Kepler was discovering these laws, Galileo was studying the laws of motion."
1541,"The problem was, what makes the planets go around?"
1542,"(In those days, one of the theories proposed was that the planets went around because behind them were invisible angels, beating their wings and driving the planets forward."
1543,You will see that this theory is now modified!
1544,"It turns out that in order to keep the planets going around, the invisible angels must fly in a different direction and they have no wings."
1545,"Otherwise, it is a somewhat similar theory!)"
1546,"Galileo discovered a very remarkable fact about motion, which was essential for understanding these laws."
1547,"That is the principle of inertia—if something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line."
1548,(Why does it keep on coasting?
1549,"We do not know, but that is the way it is.)"
1550,"Newton modified this idea, saying that the only way to change the motion of a body is to use force."
1551,"If the body speeds up, a force has been applied in the direction     of motion."
1552,"On the other hand, if its motion is changed to a new direction, a force has been applied sideways."
1553,Newton thus added the idea that a force is needed to change the speed or the direction of motion of a body.
1554,"For example, if a stone is attached to a string and is whirling around in a circle, it takes a force to keep it in the circle."
1555,We have to pull on the string.
1556,"In fact, the law is that the acceleration produced by the force is inversely proportional to the mass, or the force is proportional to the mass times the acceleration."
1557,"The more massive a thing is, the stronger the force required to produce a given acceleration."
1558,(The mass can be measured by putting other stones on the end of the same string and making them go around the same circle at the same speed.
1559,"In this way it is found that more or less force is required, the more massive object requiring more force.)"
1560,The brilliant idea resulting from these considerations is that no tangential force is needed to keep a planet in its orbit (the angels do not have to fly tangentially) because the planet would coast in that direction anyway.
1561,"If there were nothing at all to disturb it, the planet would go off in a straight line."
1562,"But the actual motion deviates from the line on which the body would have gone if there were no force, the deviation being essentially at right angles to the motion, not in the direction of the motion."
1563,"In other words, because of the principle of inertia, the force needed to control the motion of a planet around the sun is not a force around the sun but toward the sun."
1564,"(If there is a force toward the sun, the sun might be the angel, of course!)"
1565,"From his better understanding of the theory of motion, Newton appreciated that the     sun could be the seat or organization of forces that govern the motion of the planets."
1566,Newton proved to himself (and perhaps we shall be able to prove it soon) that the very fact that equal areas are swept out in equal times is a precise sign post of the proposition that all deviations are precisely radial—that the law of areas is a direct consequence of the idea that all of the forces are directed exactly toward the sun.
1567,"Next, by analyzing Kepler’s third law it is possible to show that the farther away the planet, the weaker the forces."
1568,"If two planets at different distances from the sun are compared, the analysis shows that the forces are inversely proportional to the squares of the respective distances."
1569,"With the combination of the two laws, Newton concluded that there must be a force, inversely as the square of the distance, directed in a line between the two objects."
1570,"Being a man of considerable feeling for generalities, Newton supposed, of course, that this relationship applied more generally than just to the sun holding the planets."
1571,"It was already known, for example, that the planet Jupiter had moons going around it as the moon of the earth goes around the earth, and Newton felt certain that each planet held its moons with a force."
1572,"He already knew of the force holding us on the earth, so he proposed that this was a universal force—that everything pulls everything else."
1573,"The next problem was whether the pull of the earth on its people was the “same” as its pull on the moon, i.e., inversely as the square of the distance."
1574,We might say that the moon does not fall at all.
1575,"But if there were no force on the moon, it would go off in a straight line, whereas it goes in a circle instead, so it really falls in from where it would have been if there were no force at all."
1576,"Wishing to put this theory of gravitation to a test by similar calculations, Newton made his calculations very carefully and found a discrepancy so large that he regarded the theory as contradicted by facts, and did not publish his results."
1577,Six years later a new measurement of the size of the earth showed that the astronomers had been using an incorrect distance to the moon.
1578,"When Newton heard of this, he made the calculation again, with the corrected figures, and obtained beautiful agreement."
1579,"This idea that the moon “falls” is somewhat confusing, because, as you see, it does not come any closer."
1580,The idea is sufficiently interesting to merit further explanation: the moon falls in the sense that it falls away from the straight line that it would pursue if     there were no forces.
1581,Let us take an example on the surface of the earth.
1582,Figure 7–3 shows an apparatus which demonstrates this.
1583,On the horizontal track is a ball which is going to be driven forward a little distance away.
1584,"At the same height is a ball which is going to fall vertically, and there is an electrical switch arranged so that at the moment the first ball leaves the track, the second ball is released."
1585,That they come to the same depth at the same time is witnessed by the fact that they collide in midair.
1586,What happens if we shoot a bullet faster and faster?
1587,Do not forget that the earth’s surface is curved.
1588,How can that be?
1589,"It still falls, but the earth curves away, so it falls “around” the earth."
1590,In Fig.
1591,(He took a little longer because he was a little higher.)
1592,Any great discovery of a new law is useful only if we can take more out than we put in.
1593,"Now, Newton used the second and third of Kepler’s laws to deduce his law of gravitation."
1594,What did he predict?
1595,"First, his analysis of the moon’s motion was a prediction because it connected the falling of objects on the earth’s surface with that of the moon."
1596,"Second, the question is, is the     orbit an ellipse?"
1597,"We shall see in a later chapter how it is possible to calculate the motion exactly, and indeed one can prove that it should be an ellipse,3  so no extra fact is needed to explain Kepler’s first law."
1598,Thus Newton made his first powerful prediction.
1599,The law of gravitation explains many phenomena not previously understood.
1600,"For example, the pull of the moon on the earth causes the tides, hitherto mysterious."
1601,"The moon pulls the water up under it and makes the tides—people had thought of that before, but they were not as clever as Newton, and so they thought there ought to be only one tide during the day."
1602,"Another school of thought claimed that the high tide should be on the other side of the earth because, so they argued, the moon pulls the earth away from the water!"
1603,Both of these theories are wrong.
1604,It actually works like this: the pull of the moon for the earth and for the water is “balanced” at the center.
1605,But the water which is closer to the moon is pulled more than the average and the water which is farther away from it is pulled less than the average.
1606,"Furthermore, the water can flow while the more rigid earth cannot."
1607,The true picture is a combination of these two things.
1608,What do we mean by “balanced”?
1609,What balances?
1610,"If the moon pulls the whole earth toward it, why doesn’t the earth fall right “up” to the moon?"
1611,"Because the earth does the same trick as the moon, it goes in a circle around a point which is inside the earth but not at its center."
1612,"The moon does not just go around the earth, the earth and the moon both go around a central position, each falling toward this common position, as shown in Fig."
1613,7–5.
1614,This motion around the common center is what balances the fall of each.
1615,So the earth is not going in a straight line either; it travels in a circle.
1616,"The water on the far side is “unbalanced” because the moon’s attraction there is weaker than it is at the center of the earth, where it just balances the “centrifugal force.” The result of this imbalance is that the water rises up, away from the center of the earth."
1617,"On the near side, the attraction from the moon is stronger, and the imbalance is in the opposite direction in space, but again away from the center of the earth."
1618,The net result is that we get two tidal bulges.
1619,What else can we understand when we understand gravity?
1620,Everyone knows the earth is round.
1621,Why is the earth round?
1622,That is easy; it is due to gravitation.
1623,The earth can be understood to be round merely because everything attracts everything else and so it has attracted itself together as far as it can!
1624,"If we go even further, the earth is not exactly a sphere because it is rotating, and this brings in centrifugal effects which tend to oppose gravity near the equator."
1625,"It turns out that the earth should be elliptical, and we even get the right shape for the ellipse."
1626,"We can thus deduce that the sun, the moon, and the earth should be (nearly) spheres, just from the law of gravitation."
1627,What else can you do with the law of gravitation?
1628,If we look at the moons of Jupiter we can understand everything about the way they move around that planet.
1629,"Incidentally, there was once a certain difficulty with the moons of Jupiter that is worth remarking on."
1630,"These satellites were studied very carefully by Rømer, who noticed that the moons sometimes seemed to be ahead of schedule, and sometimes behind."
1631,(One can find their schedules by waiting a very long time and finding out how long it takes on the average for the moons to go around.)
1632,Now they were ahead when Jupiter was particularly close to the earth and they were behind when Jupiter was farther from the earth.
1633,"This would have been a very difficult thing to explain according to the law of gravitation—it would have been, in fact, the death of this wonderful theory if there were no other explanation."
1634,"If a law does not work even in one place where it ought to, it is just wrong."
1635,But the reason for this discrepancy was very simple and beautiful: it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth.
1636,"When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more."
1637,"This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth."
1638,"This phenomenon showed that light does not travel instantaneously, and furnished the first estimate of the speed of light."
1639,This was done in 1676.
1640,"If all of the planets pull on each other, the force which controls, let us say, Jupiter in going around the sun is not just the force from the sun; there is also a pull from, say, Saturn."
1641,"This force is not really strong, since the sun is much more massive than Saturn, but there is some pull, so the orbit of Jupiter should not be a perfect ellipse, and it is not; it is slightly off, and “wobbles” around the correct elliptical orbit."
1642,Such a motion is a little more complicated.
1643,"Attempts were made to analyze the motions of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus on the basis of the law of gravitation."
1644,The effects of each of these planets on each other were calculated to see whether or not the tiny deviations and irregularities in these motions could be completely understood from this one law.
1645,"Lo and behold, for Jupiter and Saturn, all was well, but Uranus was “weird.” It behaved in a very peculiar manner."
1646,"It was not travelling in an exact ellipse, but that was understandable, because of the attractions of Jupiter and Saturn."
1647,"But even if allowance were made for these attractions, Uranus still was not going right, so the laws of gravitation were in danger of being overturned, a possibility that could not be ruled out."
1648,"Two men, Adams and Le Verrier, in England and France, independently, arrived at another possibility: perhaps there is another planet, dark and invisible, which men had not seen."
1649,They calculated where such a planet would have to be in order to cause the observed perturbations.
1650,"They sent messages to the respective observatories, saying, “Gentlemen, point your telescope to such and such a place, and you will see a new planet.”  It often depends on with whom you are working as to whether they pay any attention to you or not."
1651,The other observatory then also looked very quickly in the next few days and saw it too.
1652,This discovery shows that Newton’s laws are absolutely right in the solar system; but do they extend beyond the relatively small distances of the nearest planets?
1653,"The first test lies in the question, do stars attract each other as well as planets?"
1654,We have definite evidence that they do in the double stars.
1655,Figure 7–6 shows a double star—two stars very close together (there is also a third star in the picture so that we will know that the photograph was not turned).
1656,The stars are also shown as they appeared several years later.
1657,"We see that, relative to the “fixed” star, the axis of the pair has rotated, i.e., the two stars are going around each other."
1658,Do they rotate according to Newton’s laws?
1659,Careful measurements of the relative positions of one such double star system are shown in Fig.
1660,7–7.
1661,"There we see a beautiful ellipse, the measures starting in 1862 and going all the way around to 1904 (by now it must have gone around once more)."
1662,"Everything coincides with Newton’s laws, except that the star Sirius A is not at the focus."
1663,Why should that be?
1664,"Because the plane of the ellipse is not in the “plane of the sky.” We are not looking at right angles to the orbit plane, and when an ellipse is viewed at a tilt, it remains an ellipse but the focus is no longer at the same place."
1665,"Thus we can analyze double stars, moving about each other, according to the requirements of the gravitational law."
1666,That the law of gravitation is true at even bigger distances is indicated in Fig.
1667,7–8.
1668,"If one cannot see gravitation acting here, he has no soul."
1669,This figure shows one of the most beautiful things in the sky—a globular star cluster.
1670,All of the dots are stars.
1671,"Although they look as if they are packed solid toward the center, that is due to the fallibility of our instruments."
1672,"Actually, the distances between even the centermost stars are very great and they very rarely collide."
1673,"There are more stars in the interior than farther out, and as we move outward there are fewer and fewer."
1674,It is obvious that there is an attraction among these stars.
1675,"Let us now go further, and look at an entire     galaxy, shown in Fig."
1676,7–9.
1677,The shape of this galaxy indicates an obvious tendency for its matter to agglomerate.
1678,"Of course we cannot prove that the law here is precisely inverse square, only that there is still an attraction, at this enormous dimension, that holds the whole thing together."
1679,"One may say, “Well, that is all very clever but why is it not just a ball?”  Because it is spinning and has angular momentum which it cannot give up as it contracts; it must contract mostly in a plane."
1680,"(Incidentally, if you are looking for a good problem, the exact details of how the arms are formed and what determines the shapes of these galaxies has not been worked out.)"
1681,"It is, however, clear that the shape of the galaxy is due to gravitation even though the complexities of its structure have not yet allowed us to analyze it completely."
1682,"Gravity appears to exist at even bigger dimensions, as indicated by Fig."
1683,"7–10, which shows many “little” things clustered together."
1684,"This is a cluster of galaxies, just like a star cluster."
1685,Thus galaxies attract each other at such distances that they too are agglomerated into clusters.
1686,"Perhaps gravitation exists even over distances of tens of millions of light years; so far as we now know, gravity seems to go out forever inversely as the square of the distance."
1687,"Not only can we understand the nebulae, but from the law of gravitation we can even get some ideas about the origin of the stars."
1688,"If we have a big cloud of dust and gas, as indicated in Fig."
1689,"7–11, the gravitational attractions of the pieces of dust for one another might make them form little lumps."
1690,"Barely visible in the figure are “little” black spots which may be the beginning of the accumulations of dust and gases which, due to their gravitation, begin to form stars."
1691,Whether we have ever seen a star form or not is still debatable.
1692,Figure 7–12 shows the one piece of evidence which suggests that we have.
1693,"Has gas accumulated, has gravity acted hard enough and collected it into a ball big enough that the stellar nuclear reaction starts in the interior and turns it into a star?"
1694,"Perhaps, and perhaps not."
1695,It is unreasonable that in only seven years we should be so lucky as to see a star change itself into visible form; it is much less probable that we should see two!
1696,"Gravitation, therefore, extends over enormous distances."
1697,"But if there is a force between any pair of objects, we ought to be able to measure the force between our own objects."
1698,"Instead of having to watch the stars go around each other, why can we not take a ball of lead and a marble and watch the marble go toward the ball of lead?"
1699,The difficulty of this experiment when done in such a simple manner is the very weakness or delicacy of the force.
1700,"It must be done with extreme care, which means covering the apparatus to keep the air out, making sure it is not electrically charged, and so on; then the force can be measured."
1701,It was first measured by Cavendish with an apparatus which is schematically indicated in Fig.
1702,7–13.
1703,"This first demonstrated the direct force between two large, fixed balls of lead and two smaller balls of lead on the ends of an arm supported by a very fine fiber, called a torsion fiber."
1704,"By measuring how much the fiber gets twisted, one can measure the strength of the force, verify that it is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, and determine how strong it is."
1705,"You say, “We knew it already for the earth.” Yes, but we did not know the mass of the earth."
1706,This is the only way in which the mass of the earth can be determined.
1707,It is hard to exaggerate the importance of the effect on the history of science produced by this great success of the theory of gravitation.
1708,"Compare the confusion, the lack of confidence, the incomplete knowledge that prevailed in the earlier ages, when there were endless debates and paradoxes, with the clarity and simplicity of this law—this fact that all the moons and planets and stars have such a simple rule to govern them, and further that man could understand it and deduce how the planets should move!"
1709,"This is the reason for the success of the sciences in following years, for it gave hope that the other phenomena of the world might also have such beautifully simple laws."
1710,But is this such a simple law?
1711,What about the machinery of it?
1712,"All we have done is to describe how the earth moves around the sun, but we have not said what makes it go."
1713,Newton made no hypotheses about this; he was satisfied to find what it did without getting into the machinery of it.
1714,No     one has since given any machinery.
1715,It is characteristic of the physical laws that they have this abstract character.
1716,"The law of conservation of energy is a theorem concerning quantities that have to be calculated and added together, with no mention of the machinery, and likewise the great laws of mechanics are quantitative mathematical laws for which no machinery is available."
1717,Why can we use mathematics to describe nature without a mechanism behind it?
1718,No one knows.
1719,We have to keep going because we find out more that way.
1720,Many mechanisms for gravitation have been suggested.
1721,"It is interesting to consider one of these, which many people have thought of from time to time."
1722,"At first, one is quite excited and happy when he “discovers” it, but he soon finds that it is not correct."
1723,It was first discovered about 1750.
1724,Suppose there were many particles moving in space at a very high speed in all directions and being only slightly absorbed in going through matter.
1725,"When they are absorbed, they give an impulse to the earth."
1726,"However, since there are as many going one way as another, the impulses all balance."
1727,"But when the sun is nearby, the particles coming toward the earth through the sun are partially absorbed, so fewer of them are coming from the sun than are coming from the other side."
1728,"Therefore, the earth feels a net impulse toward the sun and it does not take one long to see that it is inversely as the square of the distance—because of the variation of the solid angle that the sun subtends as we vary the distance."
1729,What is wrong with that machinery?
1730,It involves some new consequences which are not true.
1731,"This particular idea has the following trouble: the earth, in moving around the sun, would impinge on more particles which are coming from its forward side than from its hind side (when you run in the rain, the rain in your face is stronger than that on the back of your head!)."
1732,"Therefore there would be more impulse given the earth from the front, and the earth would feel a resistance to motion and would be slowing up in its orbit."
1733,"One can calculate how long it would take for the earth to stop as a result of this resistance, and it would not take long enough for the earth to still be in its orbit, so this mechanism does not work."
1734,No machinery has ever been invented that “explains” gravity without also predicting some other phenomenon that does not exist.
1735,Next we shall discuss the possible relation of gravitation to other forces.
1736,There is no explanation of gravitation in terms of other forces at the present time.
1737,"It is not an aspect of electricity or anything like that, so we have no explanation."
1738,"However, gravitation and other forces are very similar, and it is interesting to note analogies."
1739,"For example, the force of electricity between two charged objects looks just like the law of gravitation: the force of electricity is a constant, with a minus sign, times the product of the charges, and varies inversely as the square of the distance."
1740,It is in the opposite direction—likes repel.
1741,But is it still not very remarkable that the two laws involve the same function of distance?
1742,Perhaps gravitation and electricity are much more closely related than we think.
1743,"Many attempts have been made to unify them; the so-called unified field theory is only a very elegant attempt to combine electricity and gravitation; but, in comparing gravitation and electricity, the most interesting thing is the relative     strengths of the forces."
1744,Any theory that contains them both must also deduce how strong the gravity is.
1745,"If we take, in some natural units, the repulsion of two electrons (nature’s universal charge) due to electricity, and the attraction of two electrons due to their masses, we can measure the ratio of electrical repulsion to the gravitational attraction."
1746,The ratio is independent of the distance and is a fundamental constant of nature.
1747,The ratio is shown in Fig.
1748,7–14.
1749,"The question is, where does such a large number come from?"
1750,"It is not accidental, like the ratio of the volume of the earth to the volume of a flea."
1751,"We have considered two natural aspects of the same thing, an electron."
1752,"This fantastic number is a natural constant, so it involves something deep in nature."
1753,Where could such a tremendous number come from?
1754,"Some say that we shall one day find the “universal equation,” and in it, one of the roots will be this number."
1755,It is very difficult to find an equation for which such a fantastic number is a natural root.
1756,Other possibilities have been thought of; one is to relate it to the age of the universe.
1757,"Clearly, we have to find another large number somewhere."
1758,But do we mean the age of the universe in years?
1759,"No, because years are not “natural”; they were devised by men."
1760,"It has about the same number of zeros going off it, so it has been proposed that the gravitational constant is related to the age of the universe."
1761,"If that were the case, the gravitational constant would change with time, because as the universe got older the ratio of the age of the universe to the time which it takes for light to go across a proton would be gradually increasing."
1762,Is it possible that the gravitational constant is changing with time?
1763,Of course the changes would be so small that it is quite difficult to be sure.
1764,"If we calculate what happens to the orbit of the earth when the gravity is changing, we find that the earth was then closer in."
1765,So we do not now believe that the gravity constant is changing with the age of the universe.
1766,"But such arguments as the one we have just given are not very convincing, and the subject is not completely closed."
1767,"It is a fact that the force of gravitation is proportional to the mass, the quantity which is fundamentally a measure of inertia—of how hard it is to hold something which is going around in a circle."
1768,"Therefore two objects, one heavy and one light, going around a larger object in the same circle at the same speed because of gravity, will stay together because to go in a circle requires a force which is stronger for a bigger mass."
1769,"That is, the gravity is stronger for a given mass in just the right     proportion so that the two objects will go around together."
1770,If one object were inside the other it would stay inside; it is a perfect balance.
1771,"Therefore, Gagarin or Titov would find things “weightless” inside a space ship; if they happened to let go of a piece of chalk, for example, it would go around the earth in exactly the same way as the whole space ship, and so it would appear to remain suspended before them in space."
1772,"It is very interesting that this force is exactly proportional to the mass with great precision, because if it were not exactly proportional there would be some effect by which inertia and weight would differ."
1773,The absence of such an effect has been checked with great accuracy by an experiment done first by Eötvös in 1909 and more recently by Dicke.
1774,This is a remarkable experiment.
1775,Another topic deserving discussion is Einstein’s modification of Newton’s law of gravitation.
1776,"In spite of all the excitement it created, Newton’s law of gravitation is not correct!"
1777,It was modified by Einstein to take into account the theory of relativity.
1778,"According to Newton, the gravitational effect is instantaneous, that is, if we were to move a mass, we would at once feel a new force because of the new position of that mass; by such means we could send signals at infinite speed."
1779,"Einstein advanced arguments which suggest that we cannot send     signals faster than the speed of light, so the law of gravitation must be wrong."
1780,"By correcting it to take the delays into account, we have a new law, called Einstein’s law of gravitation."
1781,"One feature of this new law which is quite easy to understand is this: In the Einstein relativity theory, anything which has energy has mass—mass in the sense that it is attracted gravitationally."
1782,"Even light, which has an energy, has a “mass.” When a light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sun there is an attraction on it by the sun."
1783,"Thus the light does not go straight, but is deflected."
1784,"During the eclipse of the sun, for example, the stars which are around the sun should appear displaced from where they would be if the sun were not there, and this has been observed."
1785,"Finally, let us compare gravitation with other theories."
1786,"In recent years we have discovered that all mass is made of tiny particles and that there are several kinds of interactions, such as nuclear forces, etc."
1787,None of these nuclear or electrical forces has yet been found to explain gravitation.
1788,The quantum-mechanical aspects of nature have not yet been carried over to gravitation.
1789,"When the scale is so small that we need the quantum effects, the gravitational effects are so weak that the need for a quantum theory of gravitation has not yet developed."
1790,"On the other hand, for consistency in our physical theories it would be important to see whether Newton’s law modified to Einstein’s law can be further modified to be consistent with the uncertainty principle."
1791,This last modification has not yet been completed.
1792,"In order to find the laws governing the various changes that take place in bodies as time goes on, we must be able to describe the changes and have some way to record them."
1793,"The simplest change to observe in a body is the apparent change in its position with time, which we call motion."
1794,"Let us consider some solid object with a permanent mark, which we shall call a point, that we can observe."
1795,"We shall discuss the motion of the little marker, which might be the radiator cap of an automobile or the center of a falling ball, and shall try to describe the fact that it moves and how it moves."
1796,"These examples may sound trivial, but many subtleties enter into the description of change."
1797,"Some changes are more difficult to describe than the motion of a point on a solid object, for example the speed of drift of a cloud that is drifting very slowly, but rapidly forming or evaporating, or the change of a woman’s mind."
1798,"We do not know a simple way to analyze a change of mind, but since the cloud can be represented or described by many molecules, perhaps we can describe the motion of the cloud in principle by describing the motion of all its individual molecules."
1799,"Likewise, perhaps even the changes in the mind may have a parallel in changes of the atoms inside the brain, but we have no such knowledge yet."
1800,"At any rate, that is why we begin with the motion of points; perhaps we should think of them as atoms, but it is probably better to be more rough in the beginning and simply to think of some kind of small objects—small, that is, compared with the distance moved."
1801,"For instance, in describing the motion of a car that is going a hundred miles, we do not have to distinguish between the front and the back of the car."
1802,"To be sure, there are slight differences, but for rough purposes we say “the car,” and likewise it does not matter that our points are not absolute points; for our present purposes it is not necessary to be extremely precise."
1803,"Also, while we take a first look at this subject we are going to forget about the three dimensions of the world."
1804,"We shall just concentrate on moving in one direction, as in a car on one road."
1805,We shall return to three dimensions after we see how to describe motion in one dimension.
1806,"Now, you may say, “This is all some kind of trivia,” and indeed it is."
1807,"How can we describe such a one-dimensional motion—let us say, of a car?"
1808,Nothing could be simpler.
1809,"Among many possible ways, one would be the following."
1810,"To determine the position of the car at different times, we measure its distance from the starting point and record all the observations."
1811,The first line in the table represents zero distance and zero time—the car has not started yet.
1812,That is one way to describe the motion.
1813,Another way is by means of a graph.
1814,"If we plot the time horizontally and the distance vertically, we obtain a curve something like that shown in Fig."
1815,8–1.
1816,"These observations can be made from the graph, without a table."
1817,"Obviously, for a complete description one would have to know where the car is at the half-minute marks, too, but we suppose that the graph means something, that the car has some position at all the intermediate times."
1818,The motion of a car is complicated.
1819,"For another example we take something that moves in a simpler manner, following more simple laws: a falling ball."
1820,Table 8–2 gives the time in seconds and the distance in feet for a falling body.
1821,8–2.
1822,You might say there ought to be a formula for the first graph too.
1823,"Since we do not know what the function is, there is no way we can write it in definite algebraic form."
1824,"We have now seen two examples of motion, adequately described with very simple ideas, no subtleties."
1825,"However, there are subtleties—several of them."
1826,"In the first place, what do we mean by time and space?"
1827,"It turns out that these deep philosophical questions have to be analyzed very carefully in physics, and this is not so easy to do."
1828,The theory of relativity shows that our ideas of space and time are not as simple as one might think at first sight.
1829,"However, for our present purposes, for the accuracy that we need at first, we need not be very careful about defining things precisely."
1830,"Perhaps you say, “That’s a terrible thing—I learned that in science we have to define everything precisely.” We cannot define anything precisely!"
1831,"If we attempt to, we get into that paralysis of thought that comes to philosophers, who sit opposite each other, one saying to the other, “You don’t know what you are talking about!” The second one says, “What do you mean by know?"
1832,What do you mean by talking?
1833,"What do you mean by you?,” and so on."
1834,"In order to be able to talk constructively, we just have to agree that we are talking about roughly the same thing."
1835,"You know as much about time as we need for the present, but remember that there are some subtleties that have to be discussed; we shall discuss them later."
1836,"Another subtlety involved, and already mentioned, is that it should be possible to imagine that the moving point we are observing is always located somewhere."
1837,"(Of course when we are looking at it, there it is, but maybe when we look away it isn’t there.)"
1838,"It turns out that in the motion of atoms, that idea also is false—we cannot find a marker on an atom and watch it move."
1839,That subtlety we shall have to get around in quantum mechanics.
1840,"But we are first going to learn what the problems are before introducing the complications, and then we shall be in a better position to make corrections, in the light of the more recent knowledge of the subject."
1841,"We shall, therefore, take a simple point of view about time and space."
1842,"We know what these concepts are in a rough way, and those who have driven a car know what speed means."
1843,"Even though we know roughly what “speed” means, there are still some rather deep subtleties; consider that the learned Greeks were never able to adequately describe problems involving velocity."
1844,"The subtlety comes when we try to comprehend exactly what is meant by “speed.” The Greeks got very confused about this, and a new branch of mathematics had to be discovered beyond the geometry and algebra of the Greeks, Arabs, and Babylonians."
1845,"The Greeks were somewhat confused by such problems, being helped, of course, by some very confusing Greeks."
1846,"To show that there were difficulties in reasoning about speed at the time, Zeno produced a large number of paradoxes, of which we shall mention one to illustrate his point that there are obvious difficulties in thinking about motion."
1847,"Therefore, at any moment the tortoise is always ahead of Achilles and Achilles can never catch up with the tortoise.”  What is wrong with that?"
1848,"It is that a finite amount of time can be divided into an infinite number of pieces, just as a length of line can be divided into an infinite number of pieces by dividing repeatedly by two."
1849,"And so, although there are an infinite number of steps (in the argument) to the point at which Achilles reaches the tortoise, it doesn’t mean that there is an infinite amount of time."
1850,We can see from this example that there are indeed some subtleties in reasoning about speed.
1851,"In order to get to the subtleties in a clearer fashion, we remind you of a joke which you surely must have heard."
1852,Just what do we mean?
1853,"What does that mean—kept on accelerating, going faster?"
1854,No—kept on going with the same velocity.
1855,But that is what we are trying to define!
1856,"For if the ball keeps on going the way it is going, it will just keep on going the way it is going."
1857,Thus we need to define the velocity better.
1858,What has to be kept the same?
1859,"The lady can also argue this way: “If I kept on going the way I’m going for one more hour, I would run into that wall at the end of the street!” It is not so easy to say what we mean."
1860,Many physicists think that measurement is the only definition of anything.
1861,We believe that there is something to measure before we build the speedometer.
1862,"Only then can we say, for example, “The speedometer isn’t working right,” or “the speedometer is broken.” That would be a meaningless sentence if the velocity had no meaning independent of the speedometer."
1863,"So we have in our minds, obviously, an idea that is independent of the speedometer, and the speedometer is meant only to measure this idea."
1864,So let us see if we can get a better definition of the idea.
1865,"In fact, the falling ball could not keep going the same way even one second because it would be changing speed, and we shall have to define speed somehow."
1866,"In other words, she does not have to keep on going for the whole hour; the point is that for a moment she is going at that speed."
1867,"In other words, we can find the speed in this way: We ask, how far do we go in a very short time?"
1868,"We divide that distance by the time, and that gives the speed."
1869,"But the time should be made as short as possible, the shorter the better, because some change could take place during that time."
1870,"If we take the time of a falling body as an hour, the idea is ridiculous."
1871,"If we take it as a second, the result is pretty good for a car, because there is not much change in speed, but not for a falling body; so in order to get the speed more and more accurately, we should take a smaller and smaller time interval."
1872,"What we should do is take a millionth of a second, find  out how far the car has gone, and divide that distance by a millionth of a second."
1873,"The result gives the distance per second, which is what we mean by the velocity, so we can define it that way."
1874,"That is a successful answer for the lady, or rather, that is the definition that we are going to use."
1875,"The foregoing definition involves a new idea, an idea that was not available to the Greeks in a general form."
1876,"That idea was to take an infinitesimal distance and the corresponding infinitesimal time, form the ratio, and watch what happens to that ratio as the time that we use gets smaller and smaller and smaller."
1877,"In other words, take a limit of the distance travelled divided by the time required, as the time taken gets smaller and smaller, ad infinitum."
1878,"This idea was invented by Newton and by Leibniz, independently, and is the beginning of a new branch of mathematics, called the differential calculus."
1879,Let us try to define velocity a little better.
1880,So only if the table were completed with an infinite number of entries could we really calculate the velocity from such a table.
1881,"On the other hand, when we have a complete mathematical formula, as in the case of a falling body (Eq."
1882,"8.1), then it is possible to calculate the velocity, because we can calculate the position at any time whatsoever."
1883,We want to find out exactly how fast.
1884,8.1).
1885,"That is closer, very close, but it is still not exact."
1886,It should now be evident what we must do to find the speed exactly.
1887,"When we get used to the words, the ideas are more easily understood."
1888,"For practice, let us find the derivative of a more complicated function."
1889,"Starting from the formula for the motion, we wish to find the velocity at any time."
1890,The process is even more simple than it appears.
1891,After a little practice the process gets easier because one knows what to leave out.
1892,There are many rules or formulas for differentiating various types of functions.
1893,"These can be memorized, or can be found in tables."
1894,A short list is found in Table 8–3.
1895,Now we have to discuss the inverse problem.
1896,"Suppose that instead of a table of distances, we have a table of speeds at different times, starting from zero."
1897,"For the falling ball, such speeds and times are shown in Table 8–4."
1898,"A similar table could be constructed for the velocity of the car, by recording the speedometer reading every minute or half-minute."
1899,"If we know how fast the car is going at any time, can we determine how far it goes?"
1900,This problem is just the inverse of the one solved above; we are given the velocity and asked to find the distance.
1901,How can we find the distance if we know the speed?
1902,"If the speed of the car is not constant, and the lady goes sixty miles an hour for a moment, then slows down, speeds up, and so on, how can we determine how far she has gone?"
1903,That is easy.
1904,"We use the same idea, and express the distance in terms of infinitesimals."
1905,"We proceed similarly for each second, to the end of the run."
1906,"We now have a number of little distances, and the total distance will be the sum of all these little pieces."
1907,"If we take the times short enough, the sum is precise, so we take them smaller and smaller until we obtain the desired accuracy."
1908,"One can get formulas for integrals by taking the formulas for derivatives and running them backwards, because they are related to each other inversely."
1909,Thus one can work out his own table of integrals by differentiating all sorts of functions.
1910,"For every formula with a differential, we get an integral formula if we turn it around."
1911,"Every function can be differentiated analytically, i.e., the process can be carried out algebraically, and leads to a definite function."
1912,But it is not possible in a simple manner to write an analytical value for any integral at will.
1913,"In general, given some particular function, it is not possible to find, analytically, what the integral is."
1914,"One may always try to find a function which, when differentiated, gives some desired function; but one may not find it, and it may not exist, in the sense of being expressible in terms of functions that have already been given names."
1915,"The next step in developing the equations of motion is to introduce another idea which goes beyond the concept of velocity to that of change of velocity, and we now ask, “How does the velocity change?” In previous chapters we have discussed cases in which forces produce changes in velocity."
1916,"From such a performance we can see how fast the speed changes, but only on the average."
1917,"What we shall now discuss is the next level of complexity, which is how fast the velocity is changing."
1918,"In other words, by how many feet per second does the velocity change in a second, that is, how many feet per second, per second?"
1919,Acceleration is defined as the time rate of change of velocity.
1920,"This is a very simple case, for accelerations are usually not constant."
1921,"The reason the acceleration is constant here is that the force on the falling body is constant, and Newton’s law says that the acceleration is proportional to the force."
1922,"As a further example, let us find the acceleration in the problem we have already solved for the velocity."
1923,Recall the rule that the derivative of the two terms on the right equals the sum of the derivatives of the individual terms.
1924,"For reference, we state two very useful formulas, which can be obtained by integration."
1925,Various mathematical notations are used in writing derivatives.
1926,We have another law that the velocity is equal to the integral of the acceleration.
1927,"In the foregoing discussion the motion was in only one dimension, and space permits only a brief discussion of motion in three dimensions."
1928,"At the beginning of this chapter, we opened our discussion of the one-dimensional case of a moving car by observing the distance of the car from its starting point at various times."
1929,"We then discussed velocity in terms of changes of these distances with time, and acceleration in terms of changes in velocity."
1930,We can treat three-dimensional motion analogously.
1931,"It will be simpler to illustrate the motion on a two-dimensional diagram, and then extend the ideas to three dimensions."
1932,"We establish a pair of axes at right angles to each other, and determine the position of the particle at any moment by measuring how far it is from each of the two axes."
1933,The distances are now measured from coordinate planes instead of lines.)
1934,We first find the components of velocity in each direction.
1935,"Now, given the components of velocity, how can we find the velocity along the actual path of motion?"
1936,8–3.
1937,Let us consider one nice example of compound motion in a plane.
1938,"When this equation is plotted we obtain a curve that is called a parabola; any freely falling body that is shot out in any direction will travel in a parabola, as shown in Fig."
1939,8–4.
1940,"The discovery of the laws of dynamics, or the laws of motion, was a dramatic moment in the history of science."
1941,"Before Newton’s time, the motions of things like the planets were a mystery, but after Newton there was complete understanding."
1942,"Even the slight deviations from Kepler’s laws, due to the perturbations of the planets, were computable."
1943,"The motions of pendulums, oscillators with springs and weights in them, and so on, could all be analyzed completely after Newton’s laws were enunciated."
1944,So it is with this chapter: before this chapter we could not calculate how a mass on a spring would move; much less could we calculate the perturbations on the planet Uranus due to Jupiter and Saturn.
1945,"After this chapter we will be able to compute not only the motion of the oscillating mass, but also the perturbations on the planet Uranus produced by Jupiter and Saturn!"
1946,"Galileo made a great advance in the understanding of motion when he discovered the principle of inertia: if an object is left alone, is not disturbed, it continues to move with a constant velocity in a straight line if it was originally moving, or it continues to stand still if it was just standing still."
1947,"Of course this never appears to be the case in nature, for if we slide a block across a table it stops, but that is because it is not left to itself—it is rubbing against the table."
1948,"It required a certain imagination to find the right rule, and that imagination was supplied by Galileo."
1949,"Of course, the next thing which is needed is a rule for finding how an object changes its speed if something is affecting it."
1950,"That is, the contribution of Newton."
1951,Newton wrote down three laws: The First Law was a mere restatement of the Galilean principle of inertia just described.
1952,The Second Law gave a specific way of determining how the velocity changes under different influences called forces.
1953,"The Third Law describes the forces to some extent, and we shall discuss that at another time."
1954,"Here we shall discuss only the Second Law, which asserts that the motion of an object is changed by forces in this way: the time-rate-of-change of a quantity called momentum is proportional to the force."
1955,"We shall state this mathematically shortly, but let us first explain the idea."
1956,Momentum is not the same as velocity.
1957,"A lot of words are used in physics, and they all have precise meanings in physics, although they may not have such precise meanings in everyday language."
1958,"Momentum is an example, and we must define it precisely."
1959,"If we exert a certain push with our arms on an object that is light, it moves easily; if we push just as hard on another object that is much heavier in the usual sense, then it moves much less rapidly."
1960,"Actually, we must change the words from “light” and “heavy” to less massive and more massive, because there is a difference to be understood between the weight of an object and its inertia."
1961,"(How hard it is to get it going is one thing, and how much it weighs is something else.)"
1962,"Weight and inertia are proportional, and on the earth’s surface are often taken to be numerically equal, which causes a certain confusion to the student."
1963,"On Mars, weights would be different but the amount of force needed to overcome inertia would be the same."
1964,"We use the term mass as a quantitative measure of inertia, and we may measure mass, for example, by swinging an object in a circle at a certain speed and measuring how much force we need to keep it in the circle."
1965,In this way we find a certain quantity of mass for every object.
1966,Now the momentum of an object is a product of two parts: its mass and its velocity.
1967,"In writing down any law such as this, we use many intuitive ideas, implications, and assumptions which are at first combined approximately into our “law.”  Later we may have to come back and study in greater detail exactly what each term means, but if we try to do this too soon we shall get confused."
1968,Thus at the beginning we take several things for granted.
1969,"First, that the mass of an object is constant; it isn’t really, but we shall start out with the Newtonian approximation that mass is constant, the same all the time, and that, further, when we put two objects together, their masses add."
1970,"These ideas were of course implied by Newton when he wrote his equation, for otherwise it is meaningless."
1971,"For example, suppose the mass varied inversely as the velocity; then the momentum would never change in any circumstance, so the law means nothing unless you know how the mass changes with velocity."
1972,"At first we say, it does not change."
1973,Then there are some implications concerning force.
1974,"As a rough approximation we think of force as a kind of push or pull that we make with our muscles, but we can define it more accurately now that we have this law of motion."
1975,The most important thing to realize is that this relationship involves not only changes in the magnitude of the momentum or of the velocity but also in their direction.
1976,"If the mass is constant, then Eq."
1977,"Thus we must understand that a change in a velocity, or an acceleration, has a wider meaning than in common language: The velocity of a moving object can change by its speeding up, slowing down (when it slows down, we say it accelerates with a negative acceleration), or changing its direction of motion."
1978,An acceleration at right angles to the velocity was discussed in Chapter 7.
1979,"In order to make our language more precise, we shall make one further definition in our use of the words speed and velocity."
1980,"Ordinarily we think of speed and velocity as being the same, and in ordinary language they are the same."
1981,But in physics we have taken advantage of the fact that there are two words and have chosen to use them to distinguish two ideas.
1982,"We carefully distinguish velocity, which has both magnitude and direction, from speed, which we choose to mean the magnitude of the velocity, but which does not include the direction."
1983,"Suppose, for example, that at a certain instant an object is moving as shown in Fig."
1984,9–1.
1985,In Eq.
1986,"Next, suppose that, because of the action of a force, the velocity changes to some other direction and a different magnitude, as shown in Fig."
1987,9–2.
1988,Newton’s Second Law is given in complete form in Eq.
1989,(9.7).
1990,Let us consider a simple example.
1991,"Equation (9.7) tells us that there would be changes in the velocity in the vertical direction, but no changes in the horizontal direction."
1992,This was demonstrated with a special apparatus in Chapter 7 (see Fig.
1993,7–3).
1994,"A falling body moves horizontally without any change in horizontal motion, while it moves vertically the same way as it would move if the horizontal motion were zero."
1995,"In order to use Newton’s laws, we have to have some formula for the force; these laws say pay attention to the forces."
1996,"If an object is accelerating, some agency is at work; find it."
1997,Our program for the future of dynamics must be to find the laws for the force.
1998,Newton himself went on to give some examples.
1999,In the case of gravity he gave a specific formula for the force.
2000,"In the case of other forces he gave some part of the information in his Third Law, which we will study in the next chapter, having to do with the equality of action and reaction."
2001,"Extending our previous example, what are the forces on objects near the earth’s surface?"
2002,Again we find that the motion in the horizontal direction is at constant velocity.
2003,"As another example, let us suppose that we have been able to build a gadget (Fig."
2004,9–3) which applies a force proportional to the distance and directed oppositely—a spring.
2005,"If we forget about gravity, which is of course balanced out by the initial stretch of the spring, and talk only about excess forces, we see that if we pull the mass down, the spring pulls up, while if we push it up the spring pulls down."
2006,"This machine has been designed carefully so that the force is greater, the more we pull it up, in exact proportion to the displacement from the balanced condition, and the force upward is similarly proportional to how far we pull down."
2007,"If we watch the dynamics of this machine, we see a rather beautiful motion—up, down, up, down, … The question is, will Newton’s equations correctly describe this motion?"
2008,"Let us see whether we can exactly calculate how it moves with this periodic oscillation, by applying Newton’s law (9.7)."
2009,Now let us try to analyze just what Eq.
2010,(9.12) means.
2011,"If we can answer this question our problem is solved, for then we can start with the given condition and compute how it changes for the first instant, the next instant, the next instant, and so on, and in this way we gradually evolve the motion."
2012,Why does the object move at all?
2013,"Therefore the velocity which is zero starts to change, because of the law of motion."
2014,"Once it starts to build up some velocity the object starts to move up, and so on."
2015,Now what about the velocity?
2016,And how are we going to find the acceleration?
2017,That is where the law of dynamics comes in.
2018,The law of dynamics tells us what the acceleration is.
2019,But Eq.
2020,"The velocity changes a little bit because of the force, and the position changes a little bit because of the velocity."
2021,Now let us really solve the problem.
2022,"However, for practical purposes there are some little tricks by which we can increase the accuracy."
2023,Then to go through a reasonable total time interval would take a lot of cycles of computation.
2024,This can be done if we make a subtle improvement in the technique of the analysis.
2025,But the velocity when?
2026,The velocity at the beginning of the time interval is one velocity and the velocity at the end of the time interval is another velocity.
2027,Our improvement is to use the velocity halfway between.
2028,"If we know the speed now, but the speed is changing, then we are not going to get the right answer by going at the same speed as now."
2029,We should use some speed between the “now” speed and the “then” speed at the end of the interval.
2030,"The same considerations also apply to the velocity: to compute the velocity changes, we should use the acceleration midway between the two times at which the velocity is to be found."
2031,Now we are ready to carry through our calculation.
2032,"For convenience, we may arrange the work in the form of a table, with columns for the time, the position, the velocity, and the acceleration, and the in-between lines for the velocity, as shown in Table 9–1."
2033,"Such a table is, of course, just a convenient way of representing the numerical values obtained from the set of equations (9.16), and in fact the equations themselves need never be written."
2034,We just fill in the various spaces in the table one by one.
2035,"This table now gives us a very good idea of the motion: it starts from rest, first picks up a little upward (negative) velocity and it loses some of its distance."
2036,The acceleration is then a little bit less but it is still gaining speed.
2037,Thus the speed decreases.
2038,9–4.
2039,The agreement is within the three significant figure accuracy of our calculation!
2040,"The above analysis is very nice for the motion of an oscillating spring, but can we analyze the motion of a planet around the sun?"
2041,Let us see whether we can arrive at an approximation to an ellipse for the orbit.
2042,"We shall suppose that the sun is infinitely heavy, in the sense that we shall not include its motion."
2043,"Suppose a planet starts at a certain place and is moving with a certain velocity; it goes around the sun in some curve, and we shall try to analyze, by Newton’s laws of motion and his law of gravitation, what the curve is."
2044,How?
2045,At a given moment it is at some position in space.
2046,To analyze this further we must find out what acceleration will be produced by this force.
2047,9–5.
2048,Now how do we make the calculation?
2049,In order to get the accelerations we are going to need Eq.
2050,In Fig.
2051,"The dots represent the positions at the succession of times a tenth of a unit apart; we see that at the start the planet moves rapidly and at the end it moves slowly, and so the shape of the curve is determined."
2052,Thus we see that we really do know how to calculate the motion of planets!
2053,"Now let us see how we can calculate the motion of Neptune, Jupiter, Uranus, or any other planet."
2054,"If we have a great many planets, and let the sun move too, can we do the same thing?"
2055,Of course we can.
2056,We must know the positions of all the planets.
2057,"Thus all we have to do is to make more columns, lots more columns."
2058,"We need nine columns for the motions of Jupiter, nine for the motions of Saturn, and so on."
2059,Then when we have all initial positions and velocities we can calculate all the accelerations from Eq.
2060,"(9.18) by first calculating all the distances, using Eq."
2061,(9.19).
2062,How long will it take to do it?
2063,"If you do it at home, it will take a very long time!"
2064,"Thus it takes only two minutes to follow Jupiter around the sun, with all the perturbations of all the planets correct to one part in a billion, by this method!"
2065,"If we make the interval a thousand times smaller, it is a million times more accurate."
2066,"So, as we said, we began this chapter not knowing how to calculate even the motion of a mass on a spring."
2067,"Now, armed with the tremendous power of Newton’s laws, we can not only calculate such simple motions but also, given only a machine to handle the arithmetic, even the tremendously complex motions of the planets, to as high a degree of precision as we wish!"
2068,"On the basis of Newton’s second law of motion, which gives the relation between the acceleration of any body and the force acting on it, any problem in mechanics can be solved in principle."
2069,"For example, to determine the motion of a few particles, one can use the numerical method developed in the preceding chapter."
2070,But there are good reasons to make a further study of Newton’s laws.
2071,"First, there are quite simple cases of motion which can be analyzed not only by numerical methods, but also by direct mathematical analysis."
2072,"In the same manner, although the motion of one body around the sun, determined by gravitation, can be calculated point by point by the numerical methods of Chapter 9, which show the general shape of the orbit, it is nice also to get the exact shape, which analysis reveals as a perfect ellipse."
2073,"Unfortunately, there are really very few problems which can be solved exactly by analysis."
2074,"In the case of the harmonic oscillator, for example, if the spring force is not proportional to the displacement, but is something more complicated, one must fall back on the numerical method."
2075,"Or if there are two bodies going around the sun, so that the total number of bodies is three, then analysis cannot produce a simple formula for the motion, and in practice the problem must be done numerically."
2076,"That is the famous three-body problem, which so long challenged human powers of analysis; it is very interesting how long it took people to appreciate the fact that perhaps the powers of mathematical analysis were limited and it might be necessary to use the numerical methods."
2077,"Today an enormous number of problems that cannot be done analytically are solved by numerical methods, and the old three-body problem, which was supposed to be so difficult, is solved as a matter of routine in exactly the same manner that was described in the preceding chapter, namely, by doing enough arithmetic."
2078,"However, there are also situations where both methods fail: the simple problems we can do by analysis, and the moderately difficult problems by numerical, arithmetical methods, but the very complicated problems we cannot do by either method."
2079,"A complicated problem is, for example, the collision of two automobiles, or even the motion of the molecules of a gas."
2080,"Anything like the motion of the molecules or atoms of a gas or a block of iron, or the motion of the stars in a globular cluster, instead of just two or three planets going around the sun—such problems we cannot do directly, so we have to seek other means."
2081,"In the situations in which we cannot follow details, we need to know some general properties, that is, general theorems or principles which are consequences of Newton’s laws."
2082,"One of these is the principle of conservation of energy, which was discussed in Chapter 4."
2083,"Another is the principle of conservation of momentum, the subject of this chapter."
2084,"Another reason for studying mechanics further is that there are certain patterns of motion that are repeated in many different circumstances, so it is good to study these patterns in one particular circumstance."
2085,"For example, we shall study collisions; different kinds of collisions have much in common."
2086,"In the flow of fluids, it does not make much difference what the fluid is, the laws of the flow are similar."
2087,"Other problems that we shall study are vibrations and oscillations and, in particular, the peculiar phenomena of mechanical waves—sound, vibrations of rods, and so on."
2088,"In our discussion of Newton’s laws it was explained that these laws are a kind of program that says “Pay attention to the forces,” and that Newton told us only two things about the nature of forces."
2089,"In the case of gravitation, he gave us the complete law of the force."
2090,"In the case of the very complicated forces between atoms, he was not aware of the right laws for the forces; however, he discovered one rule, one general property of forces, which is expressed in his Third Law, and that is the total knowledge that Newton had about the nature of forces—the law of gravitation and this principle, but no other details."
2091,This principle is that action equals reaction.
2092,"What is meant is something of this kind: Suppose we have two small bodies, say particles, and suppose that the first one exerts a force on the second one, pushing it with a certain force."
2093,"Then, simultaneously, according to Newton’s Third Law, the second particle will push on the first with an equal force, in the opposite direction; furthermore, these forces effectively act in the same line."
2094,"This is the hypothesis, or law, that Newton proposed, and it seems to be quite accurate, though not exact (we shall discuss the errors later)."
2095,For the moment we shall take it to be true that action equals reaction.
2096,"Of course, if there is a third particle, not on the same line as the other two, the law does not mean that the total force on the first one is equal to the total force on the second, since the third particle, for instance, exerts its own push on each of the other two."
2097,"The result is that the total effect on the first two is in some other direction, and the forces on the first two particles are, in general, neither equal nor opposite."
2098,"However, the forces on each particle can be resolved into parts, there being one contribution or part due to each other interacting particle."
2099,Then each pair of particles has corresponding components of mutual interaction that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
2100,Now what are the interesting consequences of the above relationship?
2101,The forces between them are equal and opposite; what are the consequences?
2102,We have now obtained the result that the total momentum of the two particles does not change because of any mutual interactions between them.
2103,This statement expresses the law of conservation of momentum in that particular example.
2104,"If we extend the argument to three or more interacting particles in more complicated circumstances, it is evident that so far as internal forces are concerned, the total momentum of all the particles stays constant, since an increase in momentum of one, due to another, is exactly compensated by the decrease of the second, due to the first."
2105,"That is, all the internal forces will balance out, and therefore cannot change the total momentum of the particles."
2106,"Then if there are no forces from the outside (external forces), there are no forces that can change the total momentum; hence the total momentum is a constant."
2107,It is worth describing what happens if there are forces that do not come from the mutual actions of the particles in question: suppose we isolate the interacting particles.
2108,"If there are only mutual forces, then, as before, the total momentum of the particles does not change, no matter how complicated the forces."
2109,"On the other hand, suppose there are also forces coming from the particles outside the isolated group."
2110,"Any force exerted by outside bodies on inside bodies, we call an external force."
2111,"We shall later demonstrate that the sum of all external forces equals the rate of change of the total momentum of all the particles inside, a very useful theorem."
2112,Therefore Eq.
2113,"(10.3) is really three equations, one for each direction."
2114,"In addition to the law of conservation of momentum, there is another interesting consequence of Newton’s Second Law, to be proved later, but merely stated now."
2115,This principle is that the laws of physics will look the same whether we are standing still or moving with a uniform speed in a straight line.
2116,"For example, a child bouncing a ball in an airplane finds that the ball bounces the same as though he were bouncing it on the ground."
2117,"Even though the airplane is moving with a very high velocity, unless it changes its velocity, the laws look the same to the child as they do when the airplane is standing still."
2118,This is the so-called relativity principle.
2119,"As we use it here we shall call it “Galilean relativity” to distinguish it from the more careful analysis made by Einstein, which we shall study later."
2120,"We have just derived the law of conservation of momentum from Newton’s laws, and we could go on from here to find the special laws that describe impacts and collisions."
2121,"But for the sake of variety, and also as an illustration of a kind of reasoning that can be used in physics in other circumstances where, for example, one might not know Newton’s laws and might take a different approach, we shall discuss the laws of impacts and collisions from a completely different point of view."
2122,"We shall base our discussion on the principle of Galilean relativity, stated above, and shall end up with the law of conservation of momentum."
2123,We shall start by assuming that nature would look the same if we run along at a certain speed and watch it as it would if we were standing still.
2124,"Before discussing collisions in which two bodies collide and stick together, or come together and bounce apart, we shall first consider two bodies that are held together by a spring or something else, and are then suddenly released and pushed by the spring or perhaps by a little explosion."
2125,"Further, we shall consider motion in only one direction."
2126,"First, let us suppose that the two objects are exactly the same, are nice symmetrical objects, and then we have a little explosion between them."
2127,This is an illustration of a kind of thinking that is very useful in many problems but would not be brought out if we just started with the formulas.
2128,"The first result from our experiment is that equal objects will have equal speed, but now suppose that we have two objects made of different materials, say copper and aluminum, and we make the two masses equal."
2129,"We shall now suppose that if we do the experiment with two masses that are equal, even though the objects are not identical, the velocities will be equal."
2130,"Someone might object: “But you know, you could do it backwards, you did not have to suppose that."
2131,"You could define equal masses to mean two masses that acquire equal velocities in this experiment.” We follow that suggestion and make a little explosion between the copper and a very large piece of aluminum, so heavy that the copper flies out and the aluminum hardly budges."
2132,"That is too much aluminum, so we reduce the amount until there is just a very tiny piece, then when we make the explosion the aluminum goes flying away, and the copper hardly budges."
2133,That is not enough aluminum.
2134,Evidently there is some right amount in between; so we keep adjusting the amount until the velocities come out equal.
2135,"Very well then—let us turn it around, and say that when the velocities are equal, the masses are equal."
2136,"This appears to be just a definition, and it seems remarkable that we can transform physical laws into mere definitions."
2137,"Nevertheless, there are some physical laws involved, and if we accept this definition of equal masses, we immediately find one of the laws, as follows."
2138,"If we now make the experiment between the aluminum and the gold, there is nothing in logic that says these masses must be equal; however, the experiment shows that they actually are."
2139,"So now, by experiment, we have found a new law."
2140,"A statement of this law might be: If two masses are each equal to a third mass (as determined by equal velocities in this experiment), then they are equal to each other."
2141,(This statement does not follow at all from a similar statement used as a postulate regarding mathematical quantities.)
2142,From this example we can see how quickly we start to infer things if we are careless.
2143,"It is not just a definition to say the masses are equal when the velocities are equal, because to say the masses are equal is to imply the mathematical laws of equality, which in turn makes a prediction about an experiment."
2144,"Again, in logic there is nothing that can decide this question, but experiment shows that it is true."
2145,"So, here is another law, which might be stated: If two bodies have equal masses, as measured by equal velocities at one velocity, they will have equal masses when measured at another velocity."
2146,From these examples we see that what appeared to be only a definition really involved some laws of physics.
2147,In the development that follows we shall assume it is true that equal masses have equal and opposite velocities when an explosion occurs between them.
2148,"We shall make another assumption in the inverse case: If two identical objects, moving in opposite directions with equal velocities, collide and stick together by some kind of glue, then which way will they be moving after the collision?"
2149,"This is again a symmetrical situation, with no preference between right and left, so we assume that they stand still."
2150,"We shall also suppose that any two objects of equal mass, even if the objects are made of different materials, which collide and stick together, when moving with the same velocity in opposite directions will come to rest after the collision."
2151,"We can verify the above assumptions experimentally: first, that if two stationary objects of equal mass are separated by an explosion they will move apart with the same speed, and second, if two objects of equal mass, coming together with the same speed, collide and stick together they will stop."
2152,"This we can do by means of a marvelous invention called an air trough,1 which gets rid of friction, the thing which continually bothered Galileo (Fig."
2153,10–1).
2154,"He could not do experiments by sliding things because they do not slide freely, but, by adding a magic touch, we can today get rid of friction."
2155,"Our objects will slide without difficulty, on and on at a constant velocity, as advertised by Galileo."
2156,This is done by supporting the objects on air.
2157,"Because air has very low friction, an object glides along with practically constant velocity when there is no applied force."
2158,"First, we use two glide blocks which have been made carefully to have the same weight, or mass (their weight was measured really, but we know that this weight is proportional to the mass), and we place a small explosive cap in a closed cylinder between the two blocks (Fig."
2159,10–2).
2160,We shall start the blocks from rest at the center point of the track and force them apart by exploding the cap with an electric spark.
2161,What should happen?
2162,"If the speeds are equal when they fly apart, they should arrive at the ends of the trough at the same time."
2163,"On reaching the ends they will both bounce back with practically opposite velocity, and will come together and stop at the center where they started."
2164,It is a good test; when it is actually done the result is just as we have described (Fig.
2165,10–3).
2166,Now the next thing we would like to figure out is what happens in a less simple situation.
2167,What velocity?
2168,That is the problem.
2169,"To find the answer, we make the assumption that if we ride along in a car, physics will look the same as if we are standing still."
2170,Then what does it look like?
2171,"Since we are riding along with one of the two masses which are coming together, that one appears to us to have zero velocity."
2172,10–4).
2173,In exactly the same manner we can deduce what happens when equal objects having any two velocities hit each other.
2174,What then is the actual speed on the ground?
2175,10–5).
2176,"Thus, using this principle, we can analyze any kind of collision in which two bodies of equal mass hit each other and stick."
2177,"In fact, although we have worked only in one dimension, we can find out a great deal about much more complicated collisions by imagining that we are riding by in a car in some oblique direction."
2178,"The principle is the same, but the details get somewhat complicated."
2179,"We place in the trough three equally massive objects, two of which are initially joined together with our explosive cylinder device, the third being very near to but slightly separated from these and provided with a sticky bumper so that it will stick to another object which hits it."
2180,10–6).
2181,The next problem that we want to work out is what happens if we have two different masses.
2182,What will happen then?
2183,Now the next question we may ask is this.
2184,10–7).
2185,Now we have one against two.
2186,"Using the same arguments, we can predict the result of one against three, two against three, etc."
2187,"The case of two against three, starting from rest, is shown in Fig."
2188,10–8.
2189,"In every case we find that the mass of the first object times its velocity, plus the mass of the second object times its velocity, is equal to the total mass of the final object times its velocity."
2190,"These are all examples, then, of the conservation of momentum."
2191,"Starting from simple, symmetrical cases, we have demonstrated the law for more complex cases."
2192,"We could, in fact, do it for any rational mass ratio, and since every ratio is exceedingly close to a rational ratio, we can handle every ratio as precisely as we wish."
2193,"All the foregoing examples are simple cases where the bodies collide and stick together, or were initially stuck together and later separated by an explosion."
2194,"However, there are situations in which the bodies do not cohere, as, for example, two bodies of equal mass which collide with equal speeds and then rebound."
2195,For a brief moment they are in contact and both are compressed.
2196,"At the instant of maximum compression they both have zero velocity and energy is stored in the elastic bodies, as in a compressed spring."
2197,"This energy is derived from the kinetic energy the bodies had before the collision, which becomes zero at the instant their velocity is zero."
2198,"The loss of kinetic energy is only momentary, however."
2199,The compressed condition is analogous to the cap that releases energy in an explosion.
2200,"The bodies are immediately decompressed in a kind of explosion, and fly apart again; but we already know that case—the bodies fly apart with equal speeds."
2201,"However, this speed of rebound is less, in general, than the initial speed, because not all the energy is available for the explosion, depending on the material."
2202,"If the material is putty no kinetic energy is recovered, but if it is something more rigid, some kinetic energy is usually regained."
2203,In the collision the rest of the kinetic energy is transformed into heat and vibrational energy—the bodies are hot and vibrating.
2204,The vibrational energy also is soon transformed into heat.
2205,"It is possible to make the colliding bodies from highly elastic materials, such as steel, with carefully designed spring bumpers, so that the collision generates very little heat and vibration."
2206,In these circumstances the velocities of rebound are practically equal to the initial velocities; such a collision is called elastic.
2207,"That the speeds before and after an elastic collision are equal is not a matter of conservation of momentum, but a matter of conservation of kinetic energy."
2208,"That the velocities of the bodies rebounding after a symmetrical collision are equal to and opposite each other, however, is a matter of conservation of momentum."
2209,"We might similarly analyze collisions between bodies of different masses, different initial velocities, and various degrees of elasticity, and determine the final velocities and the loss of kinetic energy, but we shall not go into the details of these processes."
2210,"Elastic collisions are especially interesting for systems that have no internal “gears, wheels, or parts.” Then when there is a collision there is nowhere for the energy to be impounded, because the objects that move apart are in the same condition as when they collided."
2211,"Therefore, between very elementary objects, the collisions are always elastic or very nearly elastic."
2212,"For instance, the collisions between atoms or molecules in a gas are said to be perfectly elastic."
2213,"Although this is an excellent approximation, even such collisions are not perfectly elastic; otherwise one could not understand how energy in the form of light or heat radiation could come out of a gas."
2214,"Once in a while, in a gas collision, a low-energy infrared ray is emitted, but this occurrence is very rare and the energy emitted is very small."
2215,"So, for most purposes, collisions of molecules in gases are considered to be perfectly elastic."
2216,"As an interesting example, let us consider an elastic collision between two objects of equal mass."
2217,"If they come together with the same speed, they would come apart at that same speed, by symmetry."
2218,What happens?
2219,We have been through this before.
2220,"We watch the symmetrical collision from a car moving along with one of the objects, and we find that if a stationary body is struck elastically by another body of exactly the same mass, the moving body stops, and the one that was standing still now moves away with the same speed that the other one had; the bodies simply exchange velocities."
2221,This behavior can easily be demonstrated with a suitable impact apparatus.
2222,"More generally, if both bodies are moving, with different velocities, they simply exchange velocity at impact."
2223,Another example of an almost elastic interaction is magnetism.
2224,"If we arrange a pair of U-shaped magnets in our glide blocks, so that they repel each other, when one drifts quietly up to the other, it pushes it away and stands perfectly still, and now the other goes along, frictionlessly."
2225,"The principle of conservation of momentum is very useful, because it enables us to solve many problems without knowing the details."
2226,"We did not know the details of the gas motions in the cap explosion, yet we could predict the velocities with which the bodies came apart, for example."
2227,Another interesting example is rocket propulsion.
2228,Rocket propulsion is essentially the same as the recoil of a gun: there is no need for any air to push against.
2229,In modern times the law of conservation of momentum has undergone certain modifications.
2230,"However, the law is still true today, the modifications being mainly in the definitions of things."
2231,The same holds true in any direction.
2232,"In Chapter 4 we saw that the law of conservation of energy is not valid unless we recognize that energy appears in different forms, electrical energy, mechanical energy, radiant energy, heat energy, and so on."
2233,"In some of these cases, heat energy for example, the energy might be said to be “hidden.” This example might suggest the question, “Are there also hidden forms of momentum—perhaps heat momentum?” The answer is that it is very hard to hide momentum for the following reasons."
2234,"The random motions of the atoms of a body furnish a measure of heat energy, if the squares of the velocities are summed."
2235,"This sum will be a positive result, having no directional character."
2236,"The heat is there, whether or not the body moves as a whole, and conservation of energy in the form of heat is not very obvious."
2237,"On the other hand, if one sums the velocities, which have direction, and finds a result that is not zero, that means that there is a drift of the entire body in some particular direction, and such a gross momentum is readily observed."
2238,"Thus there is no random internal lost momentum, because the body has net momentum only when it moves as a whole."
2239,"Therefore momentum, as a mechanical quantity, is difficult to hide."
2240,"Nevertheless, momentum can be hidden—in the electromagnetic field, for example."
2241,This case is another effect of relativity.
2242,One of the propositions of Newton was that interactions at a distance are instantaneous.
2243,"It turns out that such is not the case; in situations involving electrical forces, for instance, if an electrical charge at one location is suddenly moved, the effects on another charge, at another place, do not appear instantaneously—there is a little delay."
2244,"In those circumstances, even if the forces are equal the momentum will not check out; there will be a short time during which there will be trouble, because for a while the first charge will feel a certain reaction force, say, and will pick up some momentum, but the second charge has felt nothing and has not yet changed its momentum."
2245,In that tiny time the momentum of the particles is not conserved.
2246,"Of course after the second charge has felt the effect of the first one and all is quieted down, the momentum equation will check out all right, but during that small interval momentum is not conserved."
2247,"If we add the field momentum to the momentum of the particles, then momentum is conserved at any moment all the time."
2248,"The fact that the electromagnetic field can possess momentum and energy makes that field very real, and so, for better understanding, the original idea that there are just the forces between particles has to be modified to the idea that a particle makes a field, and a field acts on another particle, and the field itself has such familiar properties as energy content and momentum, just as particles can have."
2249,"To take another example: an electromagnetic field has waves, which we call light; it turns out that light also carries momentum with it, so when light impinges on an object it carries in a certain amount of momentum per second; this is equivalent to a force, because if the illuminated object is picking up a certain amount of momentum per second, its momentum is changing and the situation is exactly the same as if there were a force on it."
2250,"Light can exert pressure by bombarding an object; this pressure is very small, but with sufficiently delicate apparatus it is measurable."
2251,"It is hard to define exactly what is meant by the velocity of a particle, but momentum still exists."
2252,"In spite of the differences, the law of conservation of momentum holds also in quantum mechanics."
2253,In this chapter we introduce a subject that is technically known in physics as symmetry in physical law.
2254,"The word “symmetry” is used here with a special meaning, and therefore needs to be defined."
2255,When is a thing symmetrical—how can we define it?
2256,"When we have a picture that is symmetrical, one side is somehow the same as the other side."
2257,Professor Hermann Weyl has given this definition of symmetry: a thing is symmetrical if one can subject it to a certain operation and it appears exactly the same after the operation.
2258,"We shall adopt the definition of symmetry in Weyl’s more general form, and in that form we shall discuss symmetry of physical laws."
2259,"Suppose we build a complex machine in a certain place, with a lot of complicated interactions, and balls bouncing around with forces between them, and so on."
2260,"Now suppose we build exactly the same kind of equipment at some other place, matching part by part, with the same dimensions and the same orientation, everything the same only displaced laterally by some distance."
2261,"Then, if we start the two machines in the same initial circumstances, in exact correspondence, we ask: will one machine behave exactly the same as the other?"
2262,Will it follow all the motions in exact parallelism?
2263,"Of course the answer may well be no, because if we choose the wrong place for our machine it might be inside a wall and interferences from the wall would make the machine not work."
2264,All of our ideas in physics require a certain amount of common sense in their application; they are not purely mathematical or abstract ideas.
2265,We have to understand what we mean when we say that the phenomena are the same when we move the apparatus to a new position.
2266,"We mean that we move everything that we believe is relevant; if the phenomenon is not the same, we suggest that something relevant has not been moved, and we proceed to look for it."
2267,"If we never find it, then we claim that the laws of physics do not have this symmetry."
2268,"On the other hand, we may find it—we expect to find it—if the laws of physics do have this symmetry; looking around, we may discover, for instance, that the wall is pushing on the apparatus."
2269,"The basic question is, if we define things well enough, if all the essential forces are included inside the apparatus, if all the relevant parts are moved from one place to another, will the laws be the same?"
2270,Will the machinery work the same way?
2271,"It is clear that what we want to do is to move all the equipment and essential influences, but not everything in the world—planets, stars, and all—for if we do that, we have the same phenomenon again for the trivial reason that we are right back where we started."
2272,"No, we cannot move everything."
2273,"But it turns out in practice that with a certain amount of intelligence about what to move, the machinery will work."
2274,"In other words, if we do not go inside a wall, if we know the origin of the outside forces, and arrange that those are moved too, then the machinery will work the same in one location as in another."
2275,"We shall limit our analysis to just mechanics, for which we now have sufficient knowledge."
2276,"These must be measured from some origin, but where do we put the origin?"
2277,"All that Newton would tell us at first is that there is some place that we can measure from, perhaps the center of the universe, such that these laws are correct."
2278,"But we can show immediately that we can never find the center, because if we use some other origin it would make no difference."
2279,"In other words, suppose that there are two people—Joe, who has an origin in one place, and Moe, who has a parallel system whose origin is somewhere else (Fig."
2280,11–1).
2281,"The question is, if Joe knows Newton’s laws, and if Moe tries to write down Newton’s laws, will they also be correct for him?"
2282,Does it make any difference from which origin we measure the points?
2283,"In other words, assuming that equations (11.1) are true, and the Eqs."
2284,Thus the acceleration times the mass is the same as the other fellow’s.
2285,"Therefore the laws as seen by Moe appear the same; he can write Newton’s laws too, with different coordinates, and they will still be right."
2286,"That means that there is no unique way to define the origin of the world, because the laws will appear the same, from whatever position they are observed."
2287,"This is also true: if there is a piece of equipment in one place with a certain kind of machinery in it, the same equipment in another place will behave in the same way."
2288,Why?
2289,"Because one machine, when analyzed by Moe, has exactly the same equations as the other one, analyzed by Joe."
2290,"Since the equations are the same, the phenomena appear the same."
2291,So the proof that an apparatus in a new position behaves the same as it did in the old position is the same as the proof that the equations when displaced in space reproduce themselves.
2292,"Therefore we say that the laws of physics are symmetrical for translational displacements, symmetrical in the sense that the laws do not change when we make a translation of our coordinates."
2293,"Of course it is quite obvious intuitively that this is true, but it is interesting and entertaining to discuss the mathematics of it."
2294,The above is the first of a series of ever more complicated propositions concerning the symmetry of a physical law.
2295,The next proposition is that it should make no difference in which direction we choose the axes.
2296,"In other words, if we build a piece of equipment in some place and watch it operate, and nearby we build the same kind of apparatus but put it up on an angle, will it operate in the same way?"
2297,"Obviously it will not if it is a Grandfather clock, for example!"
2298,"If a pendulum clock stands upright, it works fine, but if it is tilted the pendulum falls against the side of the case and nothing happens."
2299,"The theorem is then false in the case of the pendulum clock, unless we include the earth, which is pulling on the pendulum."
2300,"Therefore we can make a prediction about pendulum clocks if we believe in the symmetry of physical law for rotation: something else is involved in the operation of a pendulum clock besides the machinery of the clock, something outside it that we should look for."
2301,"We may also predict that pendulum clocks will not work the same way when located in different places relative to this mysterious source of asymmetry, perhaps the earth."
2302,"Indeed, we know that a pendulum clock up in an artificial satellite, for example, would not tick either, because there is no effective force, and on Mars it would go at a different rate."
2303,"Pendulum clocks do involve something more than just the machinery inside, they involve something on the outside."
2304,"Once we recognize this factor, we see that we must turn the earth along with the apparatus."
2305,"Of course we do not have to worry about that, it is easy to do; one simply waits a moment or two and the earth turns; then the pendulum clock ticks again in the new position the same as it did before."
2306,"While we are rotating in space our angles are always changing, absolutely; this change does not seem to bother us very much, for in the new position we seem to be in the same condition as in the old."
2307,"This has a certain tendency to confuse one, because it is true that in the new turned position the laws are the same as in the unturned position, but it is not true that as we turn a thing it follows the same laws as it does when we are not turning it."
2308,"If we perform sufficiently delicate experiments, we can tell that the earth is rotating, but not that it had rotated."
2309,"In other words, we cannot locate its angular position, but we can tell that it is changing."
2310,Now we may discuss the effects of angular orientation upon physical laws.
2311,Let us find out whether the same game with Joe and Moe works again.
2312,"This time, to avoid needless complication, we shall suppose that Joe and Moe use the same origin (we have already shown that the axes can be moved by translation to another place)."
2313,The two coordinate systems are shown in Fig.
2314,"11–2, which is restricted to two dimensions."
2315,11–2.
2316,11–3.
2317,"As before, Newton’s laws are assumed to be true in Joe’s system, and are expressed by equations (11.1)."
2318,"The question, again, is whether Moe can apply Newton’s laws—will the results be correct for his system of rotated axes?"
2319,"In other words, if we assume that Eqs."
2320,Behold!
2321,The right sides of Eqs.
2322,"(11.8) and (11.9) are identical, so we conclude that if Newton’s laws are correct on one set of axes, they are also valid on any other set of axes."
2323,"This result, which has now been established for both translation and rotation of axes, has certain consequences: first, no one can claim his particular axes are unique, but of course they can be more convenient for certain particular problems."
2324,"For example, it is handy to have gravity along one axis, but this is not physically necessary."
2325,"Second, it means that any piece of equipment which is completely self-contained, with all the force-generating equipment completely inside the apparatus, would work the same when turned at an angle."
2326,"Not only Newton’s laws, but also the other laws of physics, so far as we know today, have the two properties which we call invariance (or symmetry) under translation of axes and rotation of axes."
2327,These properties are so important that a mathematical technique has been developed to take advantage of them in writing and using physical laws.
2328,The foregoing analysis involved considerable tedious mathematical work.
2329,"To reduce the details to a minimum in the analysis of such questions, a very powerful mathematical machinery has been devised."
2330,"This system, called vector analysis, supplies the title of this chapter; strictly speaking, however, this is a chapter on the symmetry of physical laws."
2331,"By the methods of the preceding analysis we were able to do everything required for obtaining the results that we sought, but in practice we should like to do things more easily and rapidly, so we employ the vector technique."
2332,We began by noting some characteristics of two kinds of quantities that are important in physics.
2333,"(Actually there are more than two, but let us start out with two.)"
2334,"One of them, like the number of potatoes in a sack, we call an ordinary quantity, or an undirected quantity, or a scalar."
2335,Temperature is an example of such a quantity.
2336,"Other quantities that are important in physics do have direction, for instance velocity: we have to keep track of which way a body is going, not just its speed."
2337,"Momentum and force also have direction, as does displacement: when someone steps from one place to another in space, we can keep track of how far he went, but if we wish also to know where he went, we have to specify a direction."
2338,"All quantities that have a direction, like a step in space, are called vectors."
2339,A vector is three numbers.
2340,"That is, we use the same mark to represent the first set of three numbers for one coordinate system, but the second set of three numbers if we are using the other coordinate system."
2341,"This has the advantage that when we change the coordinate system, we do not have to change the letters of our equations."
2342,The three numbers which describe the quantity in a given coordinate system are called the components of the vector in the direction of the coordinate axes of that system.
2343,"That is, we use the same symbol for the three letters that correspond to the same object, as seen from different axes."
2344,"The very fact that we can say “the same object” implies a physical intuition about the reality of a step in space, that is independent of the components in terms of which we measure it."
2345,"Now suppose there is another directed physical quantity, any other quantity, which also has three numbers associated with it, like force, and these three numbers change to three other numbers by a certain mathematical rule, if we change the axes."
2346,"In other words, any physical quantity associated with three numbers which transform as do the components of a step in space is a vector."
2347,That is the reason why vectors are so useful in physics.
2348,Now let us examine some of the properties of vectors.
2349,"As examples of vectors we may mention velocity, momentum, force, and acceleration."
2350,For many purposes it is convenient to represent a vector quantity by an arrow that indicates the direction in which it is acting.
2351,"Why can we represent force, say, by an arrow?"
2352,"Because it has the same mathematical transformation properties as a “step in space.”  We thus represent it in a diagram as if it were a step, using a scale such that one unit of force, or one newton, corresponds to a certain convenient length."
2353,"Thus we can always represent forces by lines, which is very convenient, because once we have drawn the line we no longer need the axes."
2354,"Of course, we can quickly calculate the three components as they change upon turning the axes, because that is just a geometric problem."
2355,"Now we must describe the laws, or rules, for combining vectors in various ways."
2356,Do these form a vector?
2357,"“Well,” we might say, “they are three numbers, and every three numbers form a vector.”  No, not every three numbers form a vector!"
2358,"In order for it to be a vector, not only must there be three numbers, but these must be associated with a coordinate system in such a way that if we turn the coordinate system, the three numbers “revolve” on each other, get “mixed up” in each other, by the precise laws we have already described."
2359,"The answer is, of course, yes, because the prototype transformations of Eq."
2360,(11.5) constitute what we call a linear transformation.
2361,This is shown in Fig.
2362,11–4.
2363,Note that vectors can be added in this way without reference to any coordinate axes.
2364,We leave it as a problem for the student to prove that it is a vector.
2365,Now let us consider vector subtraction.
2366,"We may define subtraction in the same way as addition, but instead of adding, we subtract the components."
2367,It comes to the same thing.
2368,The result is shown in Fig.
2369,11–5.
2370,Next we discuss velocity.
2371,Why is velocity a vector?
2372,"Is that a vector, or not?"
2373,We can find out by differentiating the expressions in Eq.
2374,So the velocity is a vector.
2375,"In fact, we see from this argument that if we differentiate any vector with respect to time we produce a new vector."
2376,"So we have several ways of producing new vectors: (1) multiply by a constant, (2) differentiate with respect to time, (3) add or subtract two vectors."
2377,"In order to write Newton’s laws in vector form, we have to go just one step further, and define the acceleration vector."
2378,"So if force is a vector, then, since we know acceleration is a vector, Eq."
2379,(11.13) will look the same in any coordinate system.
2380,"We write what looks like one law, but really, of course, it is the three laws for any particular set of axes, because any vector equation involves the statement that each of the components is equal."
2381,The fact that the acceleration is the rate of change of the vector velocity helps us to calculate the acceleration in some rather complicated circumstances.
2382,"Suppose, for instance, that a particle is moving on some complicated curve (Fig."
2383,What is the acceleration?
2384,"Answer: Acceleration is the difference in the velocity divided by the small time interval, so we need the difference of the two velocities."
2385,How do we get the difference of the velocities?
2386,No!
2387,That only works when the tails of the vectors are in the same place!
2388,"It has no meaning if we move the vector somewhere else and then draw a line across, so watch out!"
2389,We have to draw a new diagram to subtract the vectors.
2390,In Fig.
2391,"11–7, and now we can discuss the acceleration."
2392,11–8.
2393,11–7 and 11–8.
2394,Now let us examine a little further the properties of vectors.
2395,It is easy to see that the length of a step in space would be the same in any coordinate system.
2396,(11.5) we do indeed find that it is.
2397,So we see that there are other kinds of equations which are true for any two coordinate systems.
2398,Something new is involved.
2399,Out of a vector we can make a scalar.
2400,We have to find a general rule for that.
2401,It is clear what the rule is for the case just considered: add the squares of the components.
2402,The invariance of terms of the form of Eq.
2403,(11.18) then leaves the cross product terms (11.19) invariant also.
2404,Why?
2405,Thus Eq.
2406,What good is the dot product?
2407,Are there any cases in physics where we need it?
2408,"Yes, we need it all the time."
2409,"Momentum has direction; it is a vector, and it is the mass times the velocity vector."
2410,Another example of a dot product is the work done by a force when something is pushed from one place to the other.
2411,It is sometimes very convenient to talk about the component of a vector in a certain direction (say the vertical direction because that is the direction of gravity).
2412,"For such purposes, it is useful to invent what we call a unit vector in the direction that we want to study."
2413,By a unit vector we mean one whose dot product with itself is equal to unity.
2414,"This is a nice way to get the component; in fact, it permits us to get all the components and to write a rather amusing formula."
2415,"When two vectors are at right angles, their dot product is zero."
2416,This discussion of vectors is by no means complete.
2417,"However, rather than try to go more deeply into the subject now, we shall first learn to use in physical situations some of the ideas so far discussed."
2418,"Then, when we have properly mastered this basic material, we shall find it easier to penetrate more deeply into the subject without getting too confused."
2419,"However, we shall undertake a discussion of such matters in a later chapter."
2420,"Although it is interesting and worthwhile to study the physical laws simply because they help us to understand and to use nature, one ought to stop every once in a while and think, “What do they really mean?” The meaning of any statement is a subject that has interested and troubled philosophers from time immemorial, and the meaning of physical laws is even more interesting, because it is generally believed that these laws represent some kind of real knowledge."
2421,"The meaning of knowledge is a deep problem in philosophy, and it is always important to ask, “What does it mean?”"
2422,"What is the meaning of force, mass, and acceleration?” Well, we can intuitively sense the meaning of mass, and we can define acceleration if we know the meaning of position and time."
2423,"We shall not discuss those meanings, but shall concentrate on the new concept of force."
2424,"The answer is equally simple: “If a body is accelerating, then there is a force on it.” That is what Newton’s laws say, so the most precise and beautiful definition of force imaginable might simply be to say that force is the mass of an object times the acceleration."
2425,"Suppose we have a law which says that the conservation of momentum is valid if the sum of all the external forces is zero; then the question arises, “What does it mean, that the sum of all the external forces is zero?” A pleasant way to define that statement would be: “When the total momentum is a constant, then the sum of the external forces is zero.” There must be something wrong with that, because it is just not saying anything new."
2426,"If we have discovered a fundamental law, which asserts that the force is equal to the mass times the acceleration, and then define the force to be the mass times the acceleration, we have found out nothing."
2427,We could also define force to mean that a moving object with no force acting on it continues to move with constant velocity in a straight line.
2428,"If we then observe an object not moving in a straight line with a constant velocity, we might say that there is a force on it."
2429,"Now such things certainly cannot be the content of physics, because they are definitions going in a circle."
2430,"The Newtonian statement above, however, seems to be a most precise definition of force, and one that appeals to the mathematician; nevertheless, it is completely useless, because no prediction whatsoever can be made from a definition."
2431,"One might sit in an armchair all day long and define words at will, but to find out what happens when two balls push against each other, or when a weight is hung on a spring, is another matter altogether, because the way the bodies behave is something completely outside any choice of definitions."
2432,"For example, if we were to choose to say that an object left to itself keeps its position and does not move, then when we see something drifting, we could say that must be due to a “gorce”—a gorce is the rate of change of position."
2433,"Now we have a wonderful new law, everything stands still except when a gorce is acting."
2434,"You see, that would be analogous to the above definition of force, and it would contain no information."
2435,"It implies that if we study the mass times the acceleration and call the product the force, i.e., if we study the characteristics of force as a program of interest, then we shall find that forces have some simplicity; the law is a good program for analyzing nature, it is a suggestion that the forces will be simple."
2436,"Now the first example of such forces was the complete law of gravitation, which was given by Newton, and in stating the law he answered the question, “What is the force?” If there were nothing but gravitation, then the combination of this law and the force law (second law of motion) would be a complete theory, but there is much more than gravitation, and we want to use Newton’s laws in many different situations."
2437,Therefore in order to proceed we have to tell something about the properties of force.
2438,"For example, in dealing with force the tacit assumption is always made that the force is equal to zero unless some physical body is present, that if we find a force that is not equal to zero we also find something in the neighborhood that is a source of the force."
2439,This assumption is entirely different from the case of the “gorce” that we introduced above.
2440,"One of the most important characteristics of force is that it has a material origin, and this is not just a definition."
2441,"Newton also gave one rule about the force: that the forces between interacting bodies are equal and opposite—action equals reaction; that rule, it turns out, is not exactly true."
2442,"The student may object, “I do not like this imprecision, I should like to have everything defined exactly; in fact, it says in some books that any science is an exact subject, in which everything is defined.”  If you insist upon a precise definition of force, you will never get it!"
2443,"First, because Newton’s Second Law is not exact, and second, because in order to understand physical laws you must understand that they are all some kind of approximation."
2444,"Any simple idea is approximate; as an illustration, consider an object, … what is an object?"
2445,"Philosophers are always saying, “Well, just take a chair for example.” The moment they say that, you know that they do not know what they are talking about any more."
2446,What is a chair?
2447,"Well, a chair is a certain thing over there … certain?, how certain?"
2448,"The atoms are evaporating from it from time to time—not many atoms, but a few—dirt falls on it and gets dissolved in the paint; so to define a chair precisely, to say exactly which atoms are chair, and which atoms are air, or which atoms are dirt, or which atoms are paint that belongs to the chair is impossible."
2449,So the mass of a chair can be defined only approximately.
2450,"In the same way, to define the mass of a single object is impossible, because there are not any single, left-alone objects in the world—every object is a mixture of a lot of things, so we can deal with it only as a series of approximations and idealizations."
2451,The trick is the idealizations.
2452,"One may be dissatisfied with the approximate view of nature that physics tries to obtain (the attempt is always to increase the accuracy of the approximation), and may prefer a mathematical definition; but mathematical definitions can never work in the real world."
2453,"A mathematical definition will be good for mathematics, in which all the logic can be followed out completely, but the physical world is complex, as we have indicated in a number of examples, such as those of the ocean waves and a glass of wine."
2454,"When we try to isolate pieces of it, to talk about one mass, the wine and the glass, how can we know which is which, when one dissolves in the other?"
2455,"The forces on a single thing already involve approximation, and if we have a system of discourse about the real world, then that system, at least for the present day, must involve approximations of some kind."
2456,"This system is quite unlike the case of mathematics, in which everything can be defined, and then we do not know what we are talking about."
2457,"In fact, the glory of mathematics is that we do not have to say what we are talking about."
2458,"The glory is that the laws, the arguments, and the logic are independent of what “it” is."
2459,"If we have any other set of objects that obey the same system of axioms as Euclid’s geometry, then if we make new definitions and follow them out with correct logic, all the consequences will be correct, and it makes no difference what the subject was."
2460,"In nature, however, when we draw a line or establish a line by using a light beam and a theodolite, as we do in surveying, are we measuring a line in the sense of Euclid?"
2461,"No, we are making an approximation; the cross hair has some width, but a geometrical line has no width, and so, whether Euclidean geometry can be used for surveying or not is a physical question, not a mathematical question."
2462,"However, from an experimental standpoint, not a mathematical standpoint, we need to know whether the laws of Euclid apply to the kind of geometry that we use in measuring land; so we make a hypothesis that it does, and it works pretty well; but it is not precise, because our surveying lines are not really geometrical lines."
2463,"Whether or not those lines of Euclid, which are really abstract, apply to the lines of experience is a question for experience; it is not a question that can be answered by sheer reason."
2464,"By establishing suitable postulates it is always possible to make a system of mathematics, just as Euclid did, but we cannot make a mathematics of the world, because sooner or later we have to find out whether the axioms are valid for the objects of nature."
2465,"Thus we immediately get involved with these complicated and “dirty” objects of nature, but with approximations ever increasing in accuracy."
2466,"The foregoing considerations show that a true understanding of Newton’s laws requires a discussion of forces, and it is the purpose of this chapter to introduce such a discussion, as a kind of completion of Newton’s laws."
2467,"We have already studied the definitions of acceleration and related ideas, but now we have to study the properties of force, and this chapter, unlike the previous chapters, will not be very precise, because forces are quite complicated."
2468,"To begin with a particular force, let us consider the drag on an airplane flying through the air."
2469,What is the law for that force?
2470,"(Surely there is a law for every force, we must have a law!)"
2471,One can hardly think that the law for that force will be simple.
2472,"Try to imagine what makes a drag on an airplane flying through the air—the air rushing over the wings, the swirling in the back, the changes going on around the fuselage, and many other complications, and you see that there is not going to be a simple law."
2473,"Not at all, because in the first place this law is an empirical thing that is obtained roughly by tests in a wind tunnel."
2474,"The difference is not that it is empirical, but that, as we understand nature, this law is the result of an enormous complexity of events and is not, fundamentally, a simple thing."
2475,"If we continue to study it more and more, measuring more and more accurately, the law will continue to become more complicated, not less."
2476,"In other words, as we study this law of the drag on an airplane more and more closely, we find out that it is “falser” and “falser,” and the more deeply we study it, and the more accurately we measure, the more complicated the truth becomes; so in that sense we consider it not to result from a simple, fundamental process, which agrees with our original surmise."
2477,"For example, if the velocity is extremely low, so low that an ordinary airplane is not flying, as when the airplane is dragged slowly through the air, then the law changes, and the drag friction depends more nearly linearly on the velocity."
2478,"People who say, “Well the coefficient changes slightly,” are dodging the issue."
2479,"Second, there are other great complications: can this force on the airplane be divided or analyzed as a force on the wings, a force on the front, and so on?"
2480,"Indeed, this can be done, if we are concerned about the torques here and there, but then we have to get special laws for the force on the wings, and so on."
2481,"It is an amazing fact that the force on a wing depends upon the other wing: in other words, if we take the airplane apart and put just one wing in the air, then the force is not the same as if the rest of the plane were there."
2482,"The reason, of course, is that some of the wind that hits the front goes around to the wings and changes the force on the wings."
2483,"It seems a miracle that there is such a simple, rough, empirical law that can be used in the design of airplanes, but this law is not in the same class as the basic laws of physics, and further study of it will only make it more and more complicated."
2484,There just is no simple law for determining the coefficient in terms of the shape of the airplane.
2485,"In contrast, the law of gravitation is simple, and further study only indicates its greater simplicity."
2486,"We have just discussed two cases of friction, resulting from fast movement in air and slow movement in honey."
2487,"There is another kind of friction, called dry friction or sliding friction, which occurs when one solid body slides on another."
2488,In this case a force is needed to maintain motion.
2489,"This is called a frictional force, and its origin, also, is a very complicated matter."
2490,"Both surfaces of contact are irregular, on an atomic level."
2491,"There are many points of contact where the atoms seem to cling together, and then, as the sliding body is pulled along, the atoms snap apart and vibration ensues; something like that has to happen."
2492,"Formerly the mechanism of this friction was thought to be very simple, that the surfaces were merely full of irregularities and the friction originated in lifting the slider over the bumps; but this cannot be, for there is no loss of energy in that process, whereas power is in fact consumed."
2493,"The mechanism of power loss is that as the slider snaps over the bumps, the bumps deform and then generate waves and atomic motions and, after a while, heat, in the two bodies."
2494,"Now it is very remarkable that again, empirically, this friction can be described approximately by a simple law."
2495,"This law is that the force needed to overcome friction and to drag one object over another depends upon the normal force (i.e., perpendicular to the surface) between the two surfaces that are in contact."
2496,12–1).
2497,"Although this coefficient is not exactly constant, the formula is a good empirical rule for judging approximately the amount of force that will be needed in certain practical or engineering circumstances."
2498,"If the normal force or the speed of motion gets too big, the law fails because of the excessive heat generated."
2499,"It is important to realize that each of these empirical laws has its limitations, beyond which it does not really work."
2500,"We then tilt the plane at a steeper angle, until the block just begins to slide from its own weight."
2501,"If this law were exactly true, an object would start to slide at some definite inclination."
2502,"This will be true even when one weight is many times as great as the other, and so we conclude that the coefficient of friction is independent of the weight."
2503,"At one place it may stop, at another it may move with acceleration."
2504,"This behavior indicates that the coefficient of friction is only roughly a constant, and varies from place to place along the plane."
2505,The same erratic behavior is observed whether the block is loaded or not.
2506,"Such variations are caused by different degrees of smoothness or hardness of the plane, and perhaps dirt, oxides, or other foreign matter."
2507,"The friction is never due to “copper on copper,” etc., but to the impurities clinging to the copper."
2508,"In experiments of the type described above, the friction is nearly independent of the velocity."
2509,"Many people believe that the friction to be overcome to get something started (static friction) exceeds the force required to keep it sliding (sliding friction), but with dry metals it is very hard to show any difference."
2510,"The opinion probably arises from experiences where small bits of oil or lubricant are present, or where blocks, for example, are supported by springs or other flexible supports so that they appear to bind."
2511,"It is quite difficult to do accurate quantitative experiments in friction, and the laws of friction are still not analyzed very well, in spite of the enormous engineering value of an accurate analysis."
2512,"When the experiment is done at very high speed, care must be taken that the objects do not vibrate relative to one another, since apparent decreases of the friction at high speed are often due to vibrations."
2513,"At any rate, this friction law is another of those semiempirical laws that are not thoroughly understood, and in view of all the work that has been done it is surprising that more understanding of this phenomenon has not come about."
2514,"At the present time, in fact, it is impossible even to estimate the coefficient of friction between two substances."
2515,"For if we tilt the apparatus even to a vertical position, the slider will not fall off—the two pieces of copper stick together!"
2516,"The reason for this unexpected behavior is that when the atoms in contact are all of the same kind, there is no way for the atoms to “know” that they are in different pieces of copper."
2517,"When there are other atoms, in the oxides and greases and more complicated thin surface layers of contaminants in between, the atoms “know” when they are not on the same part."
2518,"When we consider that it is forces between atoms that hold the copper together as a solid, it should become clear that it is impossible to get the right coefficient of friction for pure metals."
2519,The same phenomenon can be observed in a simple home-made experiment with a flat glass plate and a glass tumbler.
2520,"If the tumbler is placed on the plate and pulled along with a loop of string, it slides fairly well and one can feel the coefficient of friction; it is a little irregular, but it is a coefficient."
2521,"If we now wet the glass plate and the bottom of the tumbler and pull again, we find that it binds, and if we look closely we shall find scratches, because the water is able to lift the grease and the other contaminants off the surface, and then we really have a glass-to-glass contact; this contact is so good that it holds tight and resists separation so much that the glass is torn apart; that is, it makes scratches."
2522,We shall next discuss the characteristics of molecular forces.
2523,"These are forces between the atoms, and are the ultimate origin of friction."
2524,Molecular forces have never been satisfactorily explained on a basis of classical physics; it takes quantum mechanics to understand them fully.
2525,"Empirically, however, the force between atoms is illustrated schematically in Fig."
2526,"There are different cases: in the water molecule, for example, the negative charges sit more on the oxygen, and the mean positions of the negative charges and of the positive charges are not at the same point; consequently, another molecule nearby feels a relatively large force, which is called a dipole-dipole force."
2527,"However, for many systems the charges are very much better balanced, in particular for oxygen gas, which is perfectly symmetrical."
2528,"In this case, although the minus charges and the plus charges are dispersed over the molecule, the distribution is such that the center of the minus charges and the center of the plus charges coincide."
2529,"A molecule where the centers do not coincide is called a polar molecule, and charge times the separation between centers is called the dipole moment."
2530,A nonpolar molecule is one in which the centers of the charges coincide.
2531,Why this is we shall learn only when we learn quantum mechanics.
2532,When there are dipoles the forces are greater.
2533,When atoms or molecules get too close they repel with a very large repulsion; that is what keeps us from falling through the floor!
2534,"These molecular forces can be demonstrated in a fairly direct way: one of these is the friction experiment with a sliding glass tumbler; another is to take two very carefully ground and lapped surfaces which are very accurately flat, so that the surfaces can be brought very close together."
2535,An example of such surfaces is the Johansson blocks that are used in machine shops as standards for making accurate length measurements.
2536,"If one such block is slid over another very carefully and the upper one is lifted, the other one will adhere and also be lifted by the molecular forces, exemplifying the direct attraction between the atoms on one block for the atoms on the other block."
2537,Nevertheless these molecular forces of attraction are still not fundamental in the sense that gravitation is fundamental; they are due to the vastly complex interactions of all the electrons and nuclei in one molecule with all the electrons and nuclei in another.
2538,"Any simple-looking formula we get represents a summation of complications, so we still have not got the fundamental phenomena."
2539,"Since the molecular forces attract at large distances and repel at short distances, as shown in Fig."
2540,"12–2, we can make up solids in which all the atoms are held together by their attractions and held apart by the repulsion that sets in when they are too close together."
2541,"12–2 crosses the axis) the forces are zero, which means that they are all balanced, so that the molecules stay that distance apart from one another."
2542,"If the molecules are pulled slightly apart there is a slight attraction, which increases as the separation increases."
2543,"If they are pulled sufficiently hard, they will separate permanently—the bond is broken."
2544,"12–2 is also very small, and can then be approximated by a straight line."
2545,"Therefore, in many circumstances, if the displacement is not too great the force is proportional to the displacement."
2546,"This principle is known as Hooke’s law, or the law of elasticity, which says that the force in a body which tries to restore the body to its original condition when it is distorted is proportional to the distortion."
2547,"This law, of course, holds true only if the distortion is relatively small; when it gets too large the body will be torn apart or crushed, depending on the kind of distortion."
2548,"The amount of force for which Hooke’s law is valid depends upon the material; for instance, for dough or putty the force is very small, but for steel it is relatively large."
2549,"Hooke’s law can be nicely demonstrated with a long coil spring, made of steel and suspended vertically."
2550,"A suitable weight hung on the lower end of the spring produces a tiny twist throughout the length of the wire, which results in a small vertical deflection in each turn and adds up to a large displacement if there are many turns."
2551,"This constant ratio of force to displacement begins to change when the spring is overloaded, i.e., Hooke’s law no longer holds."
2552,We shall now discuss the only remaining forces that are fundamental.
2553,We call them fundamental in the sense that their laws are fundamentally simple.
2554,We shall first discuss electrical force.
2555,Objects carry electrical charges which consist simply of electrons or protons.
2556,"For unlike charges, this law is like the law of gravitation, but for like charges the force is repulsive and the sign (direction) is reversed."
2557,"The constant in the formula depends, of course, upon what units are used for the force, the charge, and the distance."
2558,"In current practice the charge is measured in coulombs, the distance in meters, and the force in newtons."
2559,"Electrical forces are much more complicated than this simple formula indicates, since the formula gives the force between two objects only when the objects are standing still."
2560,We shall consider the more general case shortly.
2561,"In the analysis of forces of the more fundamental kinds (not such forces as friction, but the electrical force or the gravitational force), an interesting and very important concept has been developed."
2562,"Since at first sight the forces are very much more complicated than is indicated by the inverse-square laws and these laws hold true only when the interacting bodies are standing still, an improved method is needed to deal with the very complex forces that ensue when the bodies start to move in a complicated way."
2563,Experience has shown that an approach known as the concept of a “field” is of great utility for the analysis of forces of this type.
2564,What is the point of all this?
2565,The point is to divide the analysis into two parts.
2566,One part says that something produces a field.
2567,The other part says that something is acted on by the field.
2568,"By allowing us to look at the two parts independently, this separation of the analysis simplifies the calculation of a problem in many situations."
2569,"In the case of gravitation, we can do exactly the same thing."
2570,"In spite of how it might at first seem, this separation of one part from another is not a triviality."
2571,"It would be trivial, just another way of writing the same thing, if the laws of force were simple, but the laws of force are so complicated that it turns out that the fields have a reality that is almost independent of the objects which create them."
2572,"One can do something like shake a charge and produce an effect, a field, at a distance; if one then stops moving the charge, the field keeps track of all the past, because the interaction between two particles is not instantaneous."
2573,It is desirable to have some way to remember what happened previously.
2574,"If the force upon some charge depends upon where another charge was yesterday, which it does, then we need machinery to keep track of what went on yesterday, and that is the character of a field."
2575,"So when the forces get more complicated, the field becomes more and more real, and this technique becomes less and less of an artificial separation."
2576,"In analyzing forces by the use of fields, we need two kinds of laws pertaining to fields."
2577,"The first is the response to a field, and that gives the equations of motion."
2578,"For example, the law of response of a mass to a gravitational field is that the force is equal to the mass times the gravitational field; or, if there is also a charge on the body, the response of the charge to the electric field equals the charge times the electric field."
2579,The second part of the analysis of nature in these situations is to formulate the laws which determine the strength of the field and how it is produced.
2580,These laws are sometimes called the field equations.
2581,"We shall learn more about them in due time, but shall write down a few things about them now."
2582,"First, the most remarkable fact of all, which is true exactly and which can be easily understood, is that the total electric field produced by a number of sources is the vector sum of the electric fields produced by the first source, the second source, and so on."
2583,Can the same methods be applied to gravitation?
2584,We simply added all the force vectors to get the resultant force on a planet.
2585,"If we divide out the mass of the planet in question, we get Eq."
2586,(12.10).
2587,Equations (12.6) and (12.10) express what is known as the principle of superposition of fields.
2588,This principle states that the total field due to all the sources is the sum of the fields due to each source.
2589,"So far as we know today, for electricity this is an absolutely guaranteed law, which is true even when the force law is complicated because of the motions of the charges."
2590,"There are apparent violations, but more careful analysis has always shown these to be due to the overlooking of certain moving charges."
2591,"However, although the principle of superposition applies exactly for electrical forces, it is not exact for gravity if the field is too strong, and Newton’s equation (12.10) is only approximate, according to Einstein’s gravitational theory."
2592,"Closely related to electrical force is another kind, called magnetic force, and this too is analyzed in terms of a field."
2593,Some of the qualitative relations between electrical and magnetic forces can be illustrated by an experiment with an electron-ray tube (Fig.
2594,12–3).
2595,At one end of such a tube is a source that emits a stream of electrons.
2596,Within the tube are arrangements for accelerating the electrons to a high speed and sending some of them in a narrow beam to a fluorescent screen at the other end of the tube.
2597,"A spot of light glows in the center of the screen where the electrons strike, and this enables us to trace the electron path."
2598,"On the way to the screen the electron beam passes through a narrow space between a pair of parallel metal plates, which are arranged, say, horizontally."
2599,"A voltage can be applied across the plates, so that either plate can be made negative at will."
2600,"When such a voltage is present, there is an electric field between the plates."
2601,"The first part of the experiment is to apply a negative voltage to the lower plate, which means that extra electrons have been placed on the lower plate."
2602,"Since like charges repel, the light spot on the screen instantly shifts upward."
2603,"(We could also say this in another way—that the electrons “felt” the field, and responded by deflecting upward.)"
2604,"We next reverse the voltage, making the upper plate negative."
2605,"The light spot on the screen now jumps below the center, showing that the electrons in the beam were repelled by those in the plate above them."
2606,"(Or we could say again that the electrons had “responded” to the field, which is now in the reverse direction.)"
2607,The second part of the experiment is to disconnect the voltage from the plates and test the effect of a magnetic field on the electron beam.
2608,"This is done by means of a horseshoe magnet, whose poles are far enough apart to more or less straddle the tube."
2609,"Suppose we hold the magnet below the tube in the same orientation as the letter U, with its poles up and part of the tube in between."
2610,"We note that the light spot is deflected, say, upward, as the magnet approaches the tube from below."
2611,So it appears that the magnet repels the electron beam.
2612,"However, it is not that simple, for if we invert the magnet without reversing the poles side-for-side, and now approach the tube from above, the spot still moves upward, so the electron beam is not repelled; instead, it appears to be attracted this time."
2613,"Now we start again, restoring the magnet to its original U orientation and holding it below the tube, as before."
2614,"Behold, the spot now jumps downward, and stays down, even if we invert the magnet and approach from above, as before."
2615,"To understand this peculiar behavior, we have to have a new combination of forces."
2616,We explain it thus: Across the magnet from one pole to the other there is a magnetic field.
2617,This field has a direction which is always away from one particular pole (which we could mark) and toward the other.
2618,"Inverting the magnet did not change the direction of the field, but reversing the poles side-for-side did reverse its direction."
2619,"Although we shall not at the present time give the correct law of force between charges moving in an arbitrary manner, one relative to the other, because it is too complicated, we shall give one aspect of it: the complete law of the forces if the fields are known."
2620,"The force on a charged object depends upon its motion; if, when the object is standing still at a given place, there is some force, this is taken to be proportional to the charge, the coefficient being what we call the electric field."
2621,The next kind of force we shall discuss might be called a pseudo force.
2622,"In Chapter 11 we discussed the relationship between two people, Joe and Moe, who use different coordinate systems."
2623,"If we suppose that the laws of motion are correct for Joe, how do they look for Moe?"
2624,"This proves the law that we used in Chapter 10, namely, that if we move in a straight line with uniform velocity the laws of physics will look the same to us as when we are standing still."
2625,That is the Galilean transformation.
2626,"In other words, here is an apparent, mysterious new force of unknown origin which arises, of course, because Moe has the wrong coordinate system."
2627,This is an example of a pseudo force; other examples occur in coordinate systems that are rotating.
2628,"Another example of pseudo force is what is often called “centrifugal force.” An observer in a rotating coordinate system, e.g., in a rotating box, will find mysterious forces, not accounted for by any known origin of force, throwing things outward toward the walls."
2629,"These forces are due merely to the fact that the observer does not have Newton’s coordinate system, which is the simplest coordinate system."
2630,"Pseudo force can be illustrated by an interesting experiment in which we push a jar of water along a table, with acceleration."
2631,"Gravity, of course, acts downward on the water, but because of the horizontal acceleration there is also a pseudo force acting horizontally and in a direction opposite to the acceleration."
2632,"The resultant of gravity and pseudo force makes an angle with the vertical, and during the acceleration the surface of the water will be perpendicular to the resultant force, i.e., inclined at an angle with the table, with the water standing higher in the rearward side of the jar."
2633,"When the push on the jar stops and the jar decelerates because of friction, the pseudo force is reversed, and the water stands higher in the forward side of the jar (Fig."
2634,12–4).
2635,One very important feature of pseudo forces is that they are always proportional to the masses; the same is true of gravity.
2636,"The possibility exists, therefore, that gravity itself is a pseudo force."
2637,Is it not possible that perhaps gravitation is due simply to the fact that we do not have the right coordinate system?
2638,"After all, we can always get a force proportional to the mass if we imagine that a body is accelerating."
2639,"For instance, a man shut up in a box that is standing still on the earth finds himself held to the floor of the box with a certain force that is proportional to his mass."
2640,"But if there were no earth at all and the box were standing still, the man inside would float in space."
2641,"Einstein put forward the famous hypothesis that accelerations give an imitation of gravitation, that the forces of acceleration (the pseudo forces) cannot be distinguished from those of gravity; it is not possible to tell how much of a given force is gravity and how much is pseudo force."
2642,"It might seem all right to consider gravity to be a pseudo force, to say that we are all held down because we are accelerating upward, but how about the people in Madagascar, on the other side of the earth—are they accelerating too?"
2643,"Einstein found that gravity could be considered a pseudo force only at one point at a time, and was led by his considerations to suggest that the geometry of the world is more complicated than ordinary Euclidean geometry."
2644,"The present discussion is only qualitative, and does not pretend to convey anything more than the general idea."
2645,"To give a rough idea of how gravitation could be the result of pseudo forces, we present an illustration which is purely geometrical and does not represent the real situation."
2646,"Suppose that we all lived in two dimensions, and knew nothing of a third."
2647,"We think we are on a plane, but suppose we are really on the surface of a sphere."
2648,"And suppose that we shoot an object along the ground, with no forces on it."
2649,Where will it go?
2650,"It will appear to go in a straight line, but it has to remain on the surface of a sphere, where the shortest distance between two points is along a great circle; so it goes along a great circle."
2651,"If we shoot another object similarly, but in another direction, it goes along another great circle."
2652,"Because we think we are on a plane, we expect that these two bodies will continue to diverge linearly with time, but careful observation will show that if they go far enough they move closer together again, as though they were attracting each other."
2653,But they are not attracting each other—there is just something “weird” about this geometry.
2654,"This particular illustration does not describe correctly the way in which Einstein’s geometry is “weird,” but it illustrates that if we distort the geometry sufficiently it is possible that all gravitation is related in some way to pseudo forces; that is the general idea of the Einsteinian theory of gravitation."
2655,"We conclude this chapter with a brief discussion of the only other known forces, which are called nuclear forces."
2656,"These forces are within the nuclei of atoms, and although they are much discussed, no one has ever calculated the force between two nuclei, and indeed at present there is no known law for nuclear forces."
2657,"With particles so small and at such a tiny distance, only the quantum-mechanical laws are valid, not the Newtonian laws."
2658,"In nuclear analysis we no longer think in terms of forces, and in fact we can replace the force concept with a concept of the energy of interaction of two particles, a subject that will be discussed later."
2659,"So far as they are understood today, the laws of nuclear force are very complex; we do not understand them in any simple way, and the whole problem of analyzing the fundamental machinery behind nuclear forces is unsolved."
2660,In Chapter 4 we discussed the conservation of energy.
2661,"In that discussion, we did not use Newton’s laws, but it is, of course, of great interest to see how it comes about that energy is in fact conserved in accordance with these laws."
2662,"For clarity we shall start with the simplest possible example, and then develop harder and harder examples."
2663,"The simplest example of the conservation of energy is a vertically falling object, one that moves only in a vertical direction."
2664,"What do we mean, show it is true?"
2665,"From Newton’s Second Law we can easily tell how the object moves, and it is easy to find out how the velocity varies with time, namely, that it increases proportionally with the time, and that the height varies as the square of the time."
2666,"So if we measure the height from a zero point where the object is stationary, it is no miracle that the height turns out to be equal to the square of the velocity times a number of constants."
2667,"However, let us look at it a little more closely."
2668,"Let us find out directly from Newton’s Second Law how the kinetic energy should change, by taking the derivative of the kinetic energy with respect to time and then using Newton’s laws."
2669,Q.E.D.
2670,"Now let us look into this further and see whether it can be generalized, and thus advance our understanding."
2671,"Does it work only for a freely falling body, or is it more general?"
2672,"We expect from our discussion of the conservation of energy that it would work for an object moving from one point to another in some kind of frictionless curve, under the influence of gravity (Fig."
2673,13–1).
2674,We would like to understand why the law is still correct.
2675,"Let us follow the same analysis, finding the time rate of change of the kinetic energy."
2676,"In order to understand exactly how the conservation of energy works in general in mechanics, we shall now discuss a number of concepts which will help us to analyze it."
2677,"First, we discuss the rate of change of kinetic energy in general in three dimensions."
2678,Thus the right side of Eq.
2679,"Because the concepts of kinetic energy, and energy in general, are so important, various names have been given to the important terms in equations such as these."
2680,We thus have a marvelous theorem: the rate of change of kinetic energy of an object is equal to the power expended by the forces acting on it.
2681,"However, to study the conservation of energy, we want to analyze this still more closely."
2682,If we multiply both sides of Eq.
2683,"It means that if an object is moving in any way under the influence of a force, moving in some kind of curved path, then the change in K.E."
2684,This integral also has a name; it is called the work done by the force on the object.
2685,We see immediately that power equals work done per second.
2686,We also see that it is only a component of force in the direction of motion that contributes to the work done.
2687,A word about units.
2688,A newton-meter is called a joule; work is measured in joules.
2689,"Power, then, is joules per second, and that is also called a watt (W)."
2690,"If we multiply watts by time, the result is the work done."
2691,"The work done by the electrical company in our houses, technically, is equal to the watts times the time."
2692,Now we take another example of the law of conservation of energy.
2693,"Consider an object which initially has kinetic energy and is moving very fast, and which slides against the floor with friction."
2694,It stops.
2695,"At the start the kinetic energy is not zero, but at the end it is zero; there is work done by the forces, because whenever there is friction there is always a component of force in a direction opposite to that of the motion, and so energy is steadily lost."
2696,But now let us take a mass on the end of a pivot swinging in a vertical plane in a gravitational field with no friction.
2697,"What happens here is different, because when the mass is going up the force is downward, and when it is coming down, the force is also downward."
2698,Thus the kinetic energy with which the mass comes back to the bottom is the same as it had when it left; that is the principle of the conservation of energy.
2699,(Note that when there are friction forces the conservation of energy seems at first sight to be invalid.
2700,We have to find another form of energy.
2701,"It turns out, in fact, that heat is generated in an object when it rubs another with friction, but at the moment we supposedly do not know that.)"
2702,"The next problem to be discussed is much more difficult than the above; it has to do with the case when the forces are not constant, or simply vertical, as they were in the cases we have worked out."
2703,"We want to consider a planet, for example, moving around the sun, or a satellite in the space around the earth."
2704,13–2).
2705,Will there be a law of conservation of energy in these circumstances?
2706,"The only difference is that in this case, the force is changing as we go along, it is not just a constant."
2707,"Now certainly when a body falls toward the earth, the kinetic energy increases as the distance fallen increases, just as it does when we do not worry about the variation of force with height."
2708,We now have the formula for the potential energy in a gravitational field for vertical motion.
2709,Now we have an interesting problem.
2710,Can we make perpetual motion in a gravitational field?
2711,The gravitational field varies; in different places it is in different directions and has different strengths.
2712,"Could we do something like this, using a fixed, frictionless track: start at some point and lift an object out to some other point, then move it around an arc to a third point, then lower it a certain distance, then move it in at a certain slope and pull it out some other way, so that when we bring it back to the starting point, a certain amount of work has been done by the gravitational force, and the kinetic energy of the object is increased?"
2713,"Can we design the curve so that it comes back moving a little bit faster than it did before, so that it goes around and around and around, and gives us perpetual motion?"
2714,"Since perpetual motion is impossible, we ought to find out that this is also impossible."
2715,We ought to discover the following proposition: since there is no friction the object should come back with neither higher nor lower velocity—it should be able to keep going around and around any closed path.
2716,"Stated in another way, the total work done in going around a complete cycle should be zero for gravity forces, because if it is not zero we can get energy out by going around."
2717,"(If the work turns out to be less than zero, so that we get less speed when we go around one way, then we merely go around the other way, because the forces, of course, depend only upon the position, not upon the direction; if one way is plus, the other way would be minus, so unless it is zero we will get perpetual motion by going around either way.)"
2718,Is the work really zero?
2719,Let us try to demonstrate that it is.
2720,"First we shall explain more or less why it is zero, and then we shall examine it a little better mathematically."
2721,Suppose that we use a simple path such as that shown in Fig.
2722,Of course we may wonder whether this is too trivial a curve.
2723,What if we use a real curve?
2724,Let us try it on a real curve.
2725,"First of all, we might like to assert that a real curve could always be imitated sufficiently well by a series of sawtooth jiggles like those of Fig."
2726,"13–4, and that therefore, etc., Q.E.D., but without a little analysis, it is not obvious at first that the work done going around even a small triangle is zero."
2727,"Let us magnify one of the triangles, as shown in Fig."
2728,13–4.
2729,We also suppose that the triangle is so small that the force is essentially constant over the entire triangle.
2730,Now let us calculate the work done in going around the other two sides of the triangle.
2731,We have proved previously that the answer is zero for any path composed of a series of notches like those of Fig.
2732,"13–3, and also that we do the same work if we cut across the corners instead of going along the notches (so long as the notches are fine enough, and we can always make them very fine); therefore, the work done in going around any path in a gravitational field is zero."
2733,This is a very remarkable result.
2734,It tells us something we did not previously know about planetary motion.
2735,"It tells us that when a planet moves around the sun (without any other objects around, no other forces) it moves in such a manner that the square of the speed at any point minus some constants divided by the radius at that point is always the same at every point on the orbit."
2736,"For example, the closer the planet is to the sun, the faster it is going, but by how much?"
2737,"By the following amount: if instead of letting the planet go around the sun, we were to change the direction (but not the magnitude) of its velocity and make it move radially, and then we let it fall from some special radius to the radius of interest, the new speed would be the same as the speed it had in the actual orbit, because this is just another example of a complicated path."
2738,"So long as we come back to the same distance, the kinetic energy will be the same."
2739,"So, whether the motion is the real, undisturbed one, or is changed in direction by channels, by frictionless constraints, the kinetic energy with which the planet arrives at a point will be the same."
2740,"Thus, when we make a numerical analysis of the motion of the planet in its orbit, as we did earlier, we can check whether or not we are making appreciable errors by calculating this constant quantity, the energy, at every step, and it should not change."
2741,Why?
2742,"Either because for the numerical method we use finite intervals, or else because we made a slight mistake somewhere in arithmetic."
2743,Let us consider the energy in another case: the problem of a mass on a spring.
2744,"When we displace the mass from its balanced position, the restoring force is proportional to the displacement."
2745,"In those circumstances, can we work out a law for conservation of energy?"
2746,Let us see how this works.
2747,We pull the mass down; it is standing still and so its speed is zero.
2748,"Now we release the mass and things begin to happen (the details not to be discussed), but at any instant the kinetic plus potential energy must be a constant."
2749,Now we go on to the more general consideration of what happens when there are large numbers of objects.
2750,What happens then?
2751,We differentiate each side with respect to time and get zero.
2752,(13.5).
2753,In Eq.
2754,In Eq.
2755,"Therefore, by matching the terms one by one, we see that Eqs."
2756,"(13.16) and (13.15) are precisely the same, but of opposite sign, so that the time derivative of the kinetic plus potential energy is indeed zero."
2757,"Thus we see that, for many objects, the kinetic energy is the sum of the contributions from each individual object, and that the potential energy is also simple, it being also just a sum of contributions, the energies between all the pairs."
2758,We can understand why it should be the energy of every pair this way: Suppose that we want to find the total amount of work that must be done to bring the objects to certain distances from each other.
2759,"We may do this in several steps, bringing them in from infinity where there is no force, one by one."
2760,"First we bring in number one, which requires no work, since no other objects are yet present to exert force on it."
2761,"Now, and this is an important point, suppose we bring in the next object to position three."
2762,"Proceeding in this way, we see that the total work required to assemble the given configuration of objects is precisely the value given in Eq."
2763,(13.14) as the potential energy.
2764,It is because gravity obeys the principle of superposition of forces that we can write the potential energy as a sum over each pair of particles.
2765,Now we shall calculate the fields which are met in a few physical circumstances involving distributions of mass.
2766,"We have not so far considered distributions of mass, only particles, so it is interesting to calculate the forces when they are produced by more than just one particle."
2767,"First we shall find the gravitational force on a mass that is produced by a plane sheet of material, infinite in extent."
2768,"13–5), will of course be directed toward the sheet."
2769,Why?
2770,Have we made a mistake?
2771,"One might think that the farther away we go, the weaker the force would be."
2772,But no!
2773,"If we are close, most of the matter is pulling at an unfavorable angle; if we are far away, more of the matter is situated more favorably to exert a pull toward the plane."
2774,"At any distance, the matter which is most effective lies in a certain cone."
2775,"When we are farther away the force is smaller by the inverse square, but in the same cone, in the same angle, there is much more matter, larger by just the square of the distance!"
2776,"This analysis can be made rigorous by just noticing that the differential contribution in any given cone is in fact independent of the distance, because of the reciprocal variation of the strength of the force from a given mass, and the amount of mass included in the cone, with changing distance."
2777,"The force is not really constant of course, because when we go on the other side of the sheet it is reversed in sign."
2778,What is the field?
2779,Outside the two plates it is zero.
2780,Why?
2781,"Because one attracts and the other repels, the force being independent of distance, so that the two balance out!"
2782,"Now we come to a most interesting and important problem, whose solution we have been assuming all the time, namely, that the force produced by the earth at a point on the surface or outside it is the same as if all the mass of the earth were located at its center."
2783,"The validity of this assumption is not obvious, because when we are close, some of the mass is very close to us, and some is farther away, and so on."
2784,"When we add the effects all together, it seems a miracle that the net force is exactly the same as we would get if we put all the mass in the middle!"
2785,We now demonstrate the correctness of this miracle.
2786,"In order to do so, however, we shall consider a thin uniform hollow shell instead of the whole earth."
2787,"(The potential energy is easier to work with than is the field because we do not have to worry about angles, we merely add the potential energies of all the pieces of mass.)"
2788,(It is a general rule that the area of a zone of a sphere is proportional to its axial width.)
2789,"The earth can be imagined as a series of spherical shells, each one of which contributes an energy which depends only on its mass and the distance from its center to the particle; adding them all together we get the total mass, and therefore the earth acts as though all the material were at the center!"
2790,But notice what happens if our point is on the inside of the shell.
2791,Therefore no force; no work is done when we move about inside.
2792,"If the potential energy is the same no matter where an object is placed inside the sphere, there can be no force on it."
2793,"So there is no force inside, there is only a force outside, and the force outside is the same as though the mass were all at the center."
2794,In the preceding chapter we have presented a great many new ideas and results that play a central role in physics.
2795,These ideas are so important that it seems worthwhile to devote a whole chapter to a closer examination of them.
2796,"In the present chapter we shall not repeat the “proofs” or the specific tricks by which the results were obtained, but shall concentrate instead upon a discussion of the ideas themselves."
2797,"In learning any subject of a technical nature where mathematics plays a role, one is confronted with the task of understanding and storing away in the memory a huge body of facts and ideas, held together by certain relationships which can be “proved” or “shown” to exist between them."
2798,It is easy to confuse the proof itself with the relationship which it establishes.
2799,"Clearly, the important thing to learn and to remember is the relationship, not the proof."
2800,"In any particular circumstance we can either say “it can be shown that” such and such is true, or we can show it."
2801,"In almost all cases, the particular proof that is used is concocted, first of all, in such form that it can be written quickly and easily on the chalkboard or on paper, and so that it will be as smooth-looking as possible."
2802,"Consequently, the proof may look deceptively simple, when in fact, the author might have worked for hours trying different ways of calculating the same thing until he has found the neatest way, so as to be able to show that it can be shown in the shortest amount of time!"
2803,"The thing to be remembered, when seeing a proof, is not the proof itself, but rather that it can be shown that such and such is true."
2804,"Of course, if the proof involves some mathematical procedures or “tricks” that one has not seen before, attention should be given not to the trick exactly, but to the mathematical idea involved."
2805,"It is certain that in all the demonstrations that are made in a course such as this, not one has been remembered from the time when the author studied freshman physics."
2806,"Quite the contrary: he merely remembers that such and such is true, and to explain how it can be shown he invents a demonstration at the moment it is needed."
2807,"Anyone who has really learned a subject should be able to follow a similar procedure, but it is no use remembering the proofs."
2808,"That is why, in this chapter, we shall avoid the proofs of the various statements made previously, and merely summarize the results."
2809,The first idea that has to be digested is work done by a force.
2810,"The physical word “work” is not the word in the ordinary sense of “Workers of the world unite!,” but is a different idea."
2811,It is evident that no work whatsoever is done by a force which is at right angles to the displacement.
2812,This is the meaning of the “line integral.”
2813,"It is all very well to say that it is a marvelous formula, but it is another thing to understand what it means, or what some of the consequences are."
2814,The word “work” in physics has a meaning so different from that of the word as it is used in ordinary circumstances that it must be observed carefully that there are some peculiar circumstances in which it appears not to be the same.
2815,"For example, according to the physical definition of work, if one holds a hundred-pound weight off the ground for a while, he is doing no work."
2816,"Nevertheless, everyone knows that he begins to sweat, shake, and breathe harder, as if he were running up a flight of stairs."
2817,"Yet running upstairs is considered as doing work (in running downstairs, one gets work out of the world, according to physics), but in simply holding an object in a fixed position, no work is done."
2818,"Clearly, the physical definition of work differs from the physiological definition, for reasons we shall briefly explore."
2819,It is a fact that when one holds a weight he has to do “physiological” work.
2820,Why should he sweat?
2821,Why should he need to consume food to hold the weight up?
2822,"Why is the machinery inside him operating at full throttle, just to hold the weight up?"
2823,"Actually, the weight could be held up with no effort by just placing it on a table; then the table, quietly and calmly, without any supply of energy, is able to maintain the same weight at the same height!"
2824,The physiological situation is something like the following.
2825,"There are two kinds of muscles in the human body and in other animals: one kind, called striated or skeletal muscle, is the type of muscle we have in our arms, for example, which is under voluntary control; the other kind, called smooth muscle, is like the muscle in the intestines or, in the clam, the greater adductor muscle that closes the shell."
2826,"The smooth muscles work very slowly, but they can hold a “set”; that is to say, if the clam tries to close its shell in a certain position, it will hold that position, even if there is a very great force trying to change it."
2827,"It will hold a position under load for hours and hours without getting tired because it is very much like a table holding up a weight, it “sets” into a certain position, and the molecules just lock there temporarily with no work being done, no effort being generated by the clam."
2828,The fact that we have to generate effort to hold up a weight is simply due to the design of striated muscle.
2829,"What happens is that when a nerve impulse reaches a muscle fiber, the fiber gives a little twitch and then relaxes, so that when we hold something up, enormous volleys of nerve impulses are coming in to the muscle, large numbers of twitches are maintaining the weight, while the other fibers relax."
2830,"We can see this, of course: when we hold a heavy weight and get tired, we begin to shake."
2831,"The reason is that the volleys are coming irregularly, and the muscle is tired and not reacting fast enough."
2832,Why such an inefficient scheme?
2833,"We do not know exactly why, but evolution has not been able to develop fast smooth muscle."
2834,Smooth muscle would be much more effective for holding up weights because you could just stand there and it would lock in; there would be no work involved and no energy would be required.
2835,"However, it has the disadvantage that it is very slow-operating."
2836,"Returning now to physics, we may ask why we want to calculate the work done."
2837,"The answer is that it is interesting and useful to do so, since the work done on a particle by the resultant of all the forces acting on it is exactly equal to the change in kinetic energy of that particle."
2838,"Another interesting feature of forces and work is this: suppose that we have a sloping or a curved track, and a particle that must move along the track, but without friction."
2839,Or we may have a pendulum with a string and a weight; the string constrains the weight to move in a circle about the pivot point.
2840,"The pivot point may be changed by having the string hit a peg, so that the path of the weight is along two circles of different radii."
2841,"These are examples of what we call fixed, frictionless constraints."
2842,"In motion with a fixed frictionless constraint, no work is done by the constraint because the forces of constraint are always at right angles to the motion."
2843,"By the “forces of constraint” we mean those forces which are applied to the object directly by the constraint itself—the contact force with the track, or the tension in the string."
2844,"The forces involved in the motion of a particle on a slope moving under the influence of gravity are quite complicated, since there is a constraint force, a gravitational force, and so on."
2845,"However, if we base our calculation of the motion on conservation of energy and the gravitational force alone, we get the right result."
2846,"This seems rather strange, because it is not strictly the right way to do it—we should use the resultant force."
2847,"Nevertheless, the work done by the gravitational force alone will turn out to be the change in the kinetic energy, because the work done by the constraint part of the force is zero (Fig."
2848,14–1).
2849,The important feature here is that if a force can be analyzed as the sum of two or more “pieces” then the work done by the resultant force in going along a certain curve is the sum of the works done by the various “component” forces into which the force is analyzed.
2850,"In nature there are certain forces, that of gravity, for example, which have a very remarkable property which we call “conservative” (no political ideas involved, it is again one of those “crazy words”)."
2851,"If we calculate how much work is done by a force in moving an object from one point to another along some curved path, in general the work depends upon the curve, but in special cases it does not."
2852,"If it does not depend upon the curve, we say that the force is a conservative force."
2853,"To demonstrate this idea, consider the following."
2854,14–2).
2855,"Since the conservation of energy depends only upon changes, it does not matter if we add a constant to the potential energy."
2856,Let us now discuss the formulas for the potential energy for a number of cases.
2857,"If we have a gravitational field that is uniform, if we are not going to heights comparable with the radius of the earth, then the force is a constant vertical force and the work done is simply the force times the vertical distance."
2858,"It makes no difference, because only differences in potential energy count."
2859,Again we could add any constant we wish.
2860,"Now let us actually use one of these formulas, to see whether we understand what it means."
2861,Question: How fast do we have to shoot a rocket away from the earth in order for it to leave?
2862,"Solution: The kinetic plus potential energy must be a constant; when it “leaves,” it will be millions of miles away, and if it is just barely able to leave, we may suppose that it is moving with zero speed out there, just barely going."
2863,At the end of the motion the two energies must be equal.
2864,At what speed must a satellite travel in order to keep going around the earth?
2865,"We need, in other words, twice as much energy (because energy goes as the square of the velocity) to leave the earth as we do to go around it."
2866,"Therefore the first thing that was done historically with satellites was to get one to go around the earth, which requires a speed of five miles per second."
2867,"The next thing was to send a satellite away from the earth permanently; this required twice the energy, or about seven miles per second."
2868,"Now, continuing our discussion of the characteristics of potential energy, let us consider the interaction of two molecules, or two atoms, two oxygen atoms for instance."
2869,"When they are very far apart, the force is one of attraction, which varies as the inverse seventh power of the distance, and when they are very close the force is a very large repulsion."
2870,"Thus there is no force at this point, and so it is the equilibrium point."
2871,This is the way an oxygen molecule looks when it is cold.
2872,"When we try to push the atoms very close together the energy goes up very rapidly, because they repel each other."
2873,The reason we bring this out is that the idea of force is not particularly suitable for quantum mechanics; there the idea of energy is most natural.
2874,"We find that although forces and velocities “dissolve” and disappear when we consider the more advanced forces between nuclear matter and between molecules and so on, the energy concept remains."
2875,"Therefore we find curves of potential energy in quantum mechanics books, but very rarely do we ever see a curve for the force between two molecules, because by that time people who are doing analyses are thinking in terms of energy rather than of force."
2876,"Next we note that if several conservative forces are acting on an object at the same time, then the potential energy of the object is the sum of the potential energies from each of the separate forces."
2877,"This is the same proposition that we mentioned before, because if the force can be represented as a vector sum of forces, then the work done by the total force is the sum of the works done by the partial forces, and it can therefore be analyzed as changes in the potential energies of each of them separately."
2878,Thus the total potential energy is the sum of all the little pieces.
2879,"We could generalize this to the case of a system of many objects interacting with one another, like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, etc., or oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, etc., which are acting with respect to one another in pairs due to forces all of which are conservative."
2880,"In these circumstances the kinetic energy in the entire system is simply the sum of the kinetic energies of all of the particular atoms or planets or whatever, and the potential energy of the system is the sum, over the pairs of particles, of the potential energy of mutual interaction of a single pair, as though the others were not there."
2881,"(This is really not true for molecular forces, and the formula is somewhat more complicated; it certainly is true for Newtonian gravitation, and it is true as an approximation for molecular forces."
2882,"For molecular forces there is a potential energy, but it is sometimes a more complicated function of the positions of the atoms than simply a sum of terms from pairs.)"
2883,(13.14).
2884,Equation (13.14) expressed mathematically the following proposition: that the total kinetic energy plus the total potential energy does not change with time.
2885,"As the various planets wheel about, and turn and twist and so on, if we calculate the total kinetic energy and the total potential energy we find that the total remains constant."
2886,We have spent a considerable time discussing conservative forces; what about nonconservative forces?
2887,"We shall take a deeper view of this than is usual, and state that there are no nonconservative forces!"
2888,"As a matter of fact, all the fundamental forces in nature appear to be conservative."
2889,This is not a consequence of Newton’s laws.
2890,"In fact, so far as Newton himself knew, the forces could be nonconservative, as friction apparently is."
2891,"When we say friction apparently is, we are taking a modern view, in which it has been discovered that all the deep forces, the forces between the particles at the most fundamental level, are conservative."
2892,"If, for example, we analyze a system like that great globular star cluster that we saw a picture of, with the thousands of stars all interacting, then the formula for the total potential energy is simply one term plus another term, etc., summed over all pairs of stars, and the kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic energies of all the individual stars."
2893,"But the globular cluster as a whole is drifting in space too, and, if we were far enough away from it and did not see the details, could be thought of as a single object."
2894,"Then if forces were applied to it, some of those forces might end up driving it forward as a whole, and we would see the center of the whole thing moving."
2895,"On the other hand, some of the forces can be, so to speak, “wasted” in increasing the kinetic or potential energy of the “particles” inside."
2896,"Let us suppose, for instance, that the action of these forces expands the whole cluster and makes the particles move faster."
2897,"The total energy of the whole thing is really conserved, but seen from the outside with our crude eyes which cannot see the confusion of motions inside, and just thinking of the kinetic energy of the motion of the whole object as though it were a single particle, it would appear that energy is not conserved, but this is due to a lack of appreciation of what it is that we see."
2898,"And that, it turns out, is the case: the total energy of the world, kinetic plus potential, is a constant when we look closely enough."
2899,"When we study matter in the finest detail at the atomic level, it is not always easy to separate the total energy of a thing into two parts, kinetic energy and potential energy, and such separation is not always necessary."
2900,"It is almost always possible to do it, so let us say that it is always possible, and that the potential-plus-kinetic energy of the world is constant."
2901,"Thus the total potential-plus-kinetic energy inside the whole world is constant, and if the “world” is a piece of isolated material, the energy is constant if there are no external forces."
2902,"But as we have seen, some of the kinetic and potential energy of a thing may be internal, for instance the internal molecular motions, in the sense that we do not notice it."
2903,"We know that in a glass of water everything is jiggling around, all the parts are moving all the time, so there is a certain kinetic energy inside, which we ordinarily may not pay any attention to."
2904,"We do not notice the motion of the atoms, which produces heat, and so we do not call it kinetic energy, but heat is primarily kinetic energy."
2905,"Internal potential energy may also be in the form, for instance, of chemical energy: when we burn gasoline energy is liberated because the potential energies of the atoms in the new atomic arrangement are lower than in the old arrangement."
2906,"It is not strictly possible to treat heat as being pure kinetic energy, for a little of the potential gets in, and vice versa for chemical energy, so we put the two together and say that the total kinetic and potential energy inside an object is partly heat, partly chemical energy, and so on."
2907,"Anyway, all these different forms of internal energy are sometimes considered as “lost” energy in the sense described above; this will be made clearer when we study thermodynamics."
2908,"As another example, when friction is present it is not true that kinetic energy is lost, even though a sliding object stops and the kinetic energy seems to be lost."
2909,"The kinetic energy is not lost because, of course, the atoms inside are jiggling with a greater amount of kinetic energy than before, and although we cannot see that, we can measure it by determining the temperature."
2910,"Of course if we disregard the heat energy, then the conservation of energy theorem will appear to be false."
2911,Another situation in which energy conservation appears to be false is when we study only part of a system.
2912,"Naturally, the conservation of energy theorem will appear not to be true if something is interacting with something else on the outside and we neglect to take that interaction into account."
2913,"In classical physics potential energy involved only gravitation and electricity, but now we have nuclear energy and other energies also."
2914,"Light, for example, would involve a new form of energy in the classical theory, but we can also, if we want to, imagine that the energy of light is the kinetic energy of a photon, and then our formula (14.2) would still be right."
2915,We shall now discuss a few of the ideas associated with potential energy and with the idea of a field.
2916,"When an object is put in a field, the force on it is equal to its mass times the value of the field vector at the point where the object is put."
2917,We can also do the same with the potential energy.
2918,"In the last chapter we used this formula, that the potential is the sum of the potentials from all the different objects, to calculate the potential due to a spherical shell of matter by adding the contributions to the potential at a point from all parts of the shell."
2919,The result of this calculation is shown graphically in Fig.
2920,14–4.
2921,"When the potential is constant, there is no field, or when the potential energy is constant there is no force, because if we move an object from one place to another anywhere inside the sphere the work done by the force is exactly zero."
2922,Why?
2923,"Because the work done in moving the object from one place to the other is equal to minus the change in the potential energy (or, the corresponding field integral is the change of the potential)."
2924,"But the potential energy is the same at any two points inside, so there is zero change in potential energy, and therefore no work is done in going between any two points inside the shell."
2925,The only way the work can be zero for all directions of displacement is that there is no force at all.
2926,"This gives us a clue as to how we can obtain the force or the field, given the potential energy."
2927,"It will not do to know the potential at only this one point, as we shall see; it requires knowledge of the potential at neighboring points as well."
2928,Why?
2929,Of course this is not exact.
2930,(14.14) mean precisely the same as Eqs.
2931,One more example of fields and potentials has to do with the electrical case.
2932,It is easy to show from Eq.
2933,"(12.11) that the force on a particle due to magnetic fields is always at right angles to its velocity, and also at right angles to the field."
2934,"Since the force due to magnetism on a moving charge is at right angles to the velocity, no work is done by the magnetism on the moving charge because the motion is at right angles to the force."
2935,"Therefore, in calculating theorems of kinetic energy in electric and magnetic fields we can disregard the contribution from the magnetic field, since it does not change the kinetic energy.)"
2936,We suppose that there is only an electric field.
2937,This is called a parallel-plate capacitor.
2938,14–5).
2939,We would like to know how much work would be done in carrying a charge from one plate to the other.
2940,"When we say a pair of plates is charged to a certain voltage, what we mean is that the difference in electrical potential of the two plates is so-and-so many volts."
2941,"For over 200 years the equations of motion enunciated by Newton were believed to describe nature correctly, and the first time that an error in these laws was discovered, the way to correct it was also discovered."
2942,Both the error and its correction were discovered by Einstein in 1905.
2943,"For those who want to learn just enough about it so they can solve problems, that is all there is to the theory of relativity—it just changes Newton’s laws by introducing a correction factor to the mass."
2944,From the formula itself it is easy to see that this mass increase is very small in ordinary circumstances.
2945,"Actually, the correctness of the formula has been amply confirmed by the observation of many kinds of particles, moving at speeds ranging up to practically the speed of light."
2946,"However, because the effect is ordinarily so small, it seems remarkable that it was discovered theoretically before it was discovered experimentally."
2947,"Empirically, at a sufficiently high velocity, the effect is very large, but it was not discovered that way."
2948,Therefore it is interesting to see how a law that involved so delicate a modification (at the time when it was first discovered) was brought to light by a combination of experiments and physical reasoning.
2949,"Contributions to the discovery were made by a number of people, the final result of whose work was Einstein’s discovery."
2950,There are really two Einstein theories of relativity.
2951,"This chapter is concerned with the Special Theory of Relativity, which dates from 1905."
2952,"In 1915 Einstein published an additional theory, called the General Theory of Relativity."
2953,This latter theory deals with the extension of the Special Theory to the case of the law of gravitation; we shall not discuss the General Theory here.
2954,"The principle of relativity was first stated by Newton, in one of his corollaries to the laws of motion: “The motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among themselves, whether that space is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a straight line.” This means, for example, that if a space ship is drifting along at a uniform speed, all experiments performed in the space ship and all the phenomena in the space ship will appear the same as if the ship were not moving, provided, of course, that one does not look outside."
2955,That is the meaning of the principle of relativity.
2956,"This is a simple enough idea, and the only question is whether it is true that in all experiments performed inside a moving system the laws of physics will appear the same as they would if the system were standing still."
2957,Let us first investigate whether Newton’s laws appear the same in the moving system.
2958,15–1.
2959,The relationship of the coordinates in the two systems is clear from the diagram.
2960,The principle of relativity has been used in mechanics for a long time.
2961,"It was employed by various people, in particular Huygens, to obtain the rules for the collision of billiard balls, in much the same way as we used it in Chapter 10 to discuss the conservation of momentum."
2962,"In the 19th century interest in it was heightened as the result of investigations into the phenomena of electricity, magnetism, and light."
2963,"A long series of careful studies of these phenomena by many people culminated in Maxwell’s equations of the electromagnetic field, which describe electricity, magnetism, and light in one uniform system."
2964,"However, the Maxwell equations did not seem to obey the principle of relativity."
2965,"That is, if we transform Maxwell’s equations by the substitution of equations (15.2), their form does not remain the same; therefore, in a moving space ship the electrical and optical phenomena should be different from those in a stationary ship."
2966,"Thus one could use these optical phenomena to determine the speed of the ship; in particular, one could determine the absolute speed of the ship by making suitable optical or electrical measurements."
2967,"This is analogous to the case of sound, the speed of sound waves being likewise independent of the motion of the source."
2968,"This independence of the motion of the source, in the case of light, brings up an interesting problem:"
2969,"In any case, by measuring the speed of the light going past the car (if the Galilean transformation is correct for light), one could determine the speed of the car."
2970,"A number of experiments based on this general idea were performed to determine the velocity of the earth, but they all failed—they gave no velocity at all."
2971,"We shall discuss one of these experiments in detail, to show exactly what was done and what was the matter; something was the matter, of course, something was wrong with the equations of physics."
2972,What could it be?
2973,"When the failure of the equations of physics in the above case came to light, the first thought that occurred was that the trouble must lie in the new Maxwell equations of electrodynamics, which were only 20 years old at the time."
2974,"It seemed almost obvious that these equations must be wrong, so the thing to do was to change them in such a way that under the Galilean transformation the principle of relativity would be satisfied."
2975,"When this was tried, the new terms that had to be put into the equations led to predictions of new electrical phenomena that did not exist at all when tested experimentally, so this attempt had to be abandoned."
2976,"Then it gradually became apparent that Maxwell’s laws of electrodynamics were correct, and the trouble must be sought elsewhere."
2977,Equations (15.3) are known as a Lorentz transformation.
2978,"Einstein, following a suggestion originally made by Poincaré, then proposed that all the physical laws should be of such a kind that they remain unchanged under a Lorentz transformation."
2979,"In other words, we should change, not the laws of electrodynamics, but the laws of mechanics."
2980,How shall we change Newton’s laws so that they will remain unchanged by the Lorentz transformation?
2981,"If this goal is set, we then have to rewrite Newton’s equations in such a way that the conditions we have imposed are satisfied."
2982,(15.1).
2983,"When this change is made, Newton’s laws and the laws of electrodynamics will harmonize."
2984,"Then if we use the Lorentz transformation in comparing Moe’s measurements with Joe’s, we shall never be able to detect whether either is moving, because the form of all the equations will be the same in both coordinate systems!"
2985,"It is interesting to discuss what it means that we replace the old transformation between the coordinates and time with a new one, because the old one (Galilean) seems to be self-evident, and the new one (Lorentz) looks peculiar."
2986,"We wish to know whether it is logically and experimentally possible that the new, and not the old, transformation can be correct."
2987,"To find that out, it is not enough to study the laws of mechanics but, as Einstein did, we too must analyze our ideas of space and time in order to understand this transformation."
2988,"We shall have to discuss these ideas and their implications for mechanics at some length, so we say in advance that the effort will be justified, since the results agree with experiment."
2989,"As mentioned above, attempts were made to determine the absolute velocity of the earth through the hypothetical “ether” that was supposed to pervade all space."
2990,The most famous of these experiments is one performed by Michelson and Morley in 1887.
2991,"It was 18 years later before the negative results of the experiment were finally explained, by Einstein."
2992,The Michelson-Morley experiment was performed with an apparatus like that shown schematically in Fig.
2993,15–2.
2994,Let us see why.
2995,We are now able to compare the times taken by the two beams of light.
2996,"In expressions (15.4) and (15.5) the numerators are identical, and represent the time that would be taken if the apparatus were at rest."
2997,The denominators represent the modifications in the times caused by the motion of the apparatus.
2998,"In fact, we surely cannot make them exactly equal."
2999,"Any small difference in length then becomes unimportant, and what we look for is a shift in the interference fringes when we rotate the apparatus."
3000,"The apparatus was amply sensitive to observe such an effect, but no time difference was found—the velocity of the earth through the ether could not be detected."
3001,The result of the experiment was null.
3002,The result of the Michelson-Morley experiment was very puzzling and most disturbing.
3003,The first fruitful idea for finding a way out of the impasse came from Lorentz.
3004,Therefore Eq.
3005,(15.4) must be changed in accordance with Eq.
3006,(15.6).
3007,"So if the apparatus shrinks in the manner just described, we have a way of understanding why the Michelson-Morley experiment gives no effect at all."
3008,"Although the contraction hypothesis successfully accounted for the negative result of the experiment, it was open to the objection that it was invented for the express purpose of explaining away the difficulty, and was too artificial."
3009,"It was ultimately recognized, as Poincaré pointed out, that a complete conspiracy is itself a law of nature!"
3010,"Poincaré then proposed that there is such a law of nature, that it is not possible to discover an ether wind by any experiment; that is, there is no way to determine an absolute velocity."
3011,"In checking out whether the contraction idea is in harmony with the facts in other experiments, it turns out that everything is correct provided that the times are also modified, in the manner expressed in the fourth equation of the set (15.3)."
3012,15.5).
3013,"In other words, when the outsider sees the man in the space ship lighting a cigar, all the actions appear to be slower than normal, while to the man inside, everything moves at a normal rate."
3014,"So not only must the lengths shorten, but also the time-measuring instruments (“clocks”) must apparently slow down."
3015,"This slowing of the clocks in a moving system is a very peculiar phenomenon, and is worth an explanation."
3016,"In order to understand this, we have to watch the machinery of the clock and see what happens when it is moving."
3017,"Since that is rather difficult, we shall take a very simple kind of clock."
3018,"The one we choose is rather a silly kind of clock, but it will work in principle: it is a rod (meter stick) with a mirror at each end, and when we start a light signal between the mirrors, the light keeps going up and down, making a click every time it comes down, like a standard ticking clock."
3019,"We give one of these clocks to the man to take along in his space ship, and he mounts the rod perpendicular to the direction of motion of the ship; then the length of the rod will not change."
3020,How do we know that perpendicular lengths do not change?
3021,Now let us see what happens to the moving clock.
3022,"Before the man took it aboard, he agreed that it was a nice, standard clock, and when he goes along in the space ship he will not see anything peculiar."
3023,"If he did, he would know he was moving—if anything at all changed because of the motion, he could tell he was moving."
3024,"But the principle of relativity says this is impossible in a uniformly moving system, so nothing has changed."
3025,"On the other hand, when the external observer looks at the clock going by, he sees that the light, in going from mirror to mirror, is “really” taking a zigzag path, since the rod is moving sidewise all the while."
3026,We have already analyzed such a zigzag motion in connection with the Michelson-Morley experiment.
3027,"That is, it takes a longer time for light to go from end to end in the moving clock than in the stationary clock."
3028,"Therefore the apparent time between clicks is longer for the moving clock, in the same proportion as shown in the hypotenuse of the triangle (that is the source of the square root expressions in our equations)."
3029,"Not only does this particular kind of clock run more slowly, but if the theory of relativity is correct, any other clock, operating on any principle whatsoever, would also appear to run slower, and in the same proportion—we can say this without further analysis."
3030,Why is this so?
3031,"To answer the above question, suppose we had two other clocks made exactly alike with wheels and gears, or perhaps based on radioactive decay, or something else."
3032,Then we adjust these clocks so they both run in precise synchronism with our first clocks.
3033,"When light goes up and back in the first clocks and announces its arrival with a click, the new models also complete some sort of cycle, which they simultaneously announce by some doubly coincident flash, or bong, or other signal."
3034,"One of these clocks is taken into the space ship, along with the first kind."
3035,"Perhaps this clock will not run slower, but will continue to keep the same time as its stationary counterpart, and thus disagree with the other moving clock."
3036,"Ah no, if that should happen, the man in the ship could use this mismatch between his two clocks to determine the speed of his ship, which we have been supposing is impossible."
3037,"We need not know anything about the machinery of the new clock that might cause the effect—we simply know that whatever the reason, it will appear to run slow, just like the first one."
3038,"Now if all moving clocks run slower, if no way of measuring time gives anything but a slower rate, we shall just have to say, in a certain sense, that time itself appears to be slower in a space ship."
3039,"All the phenomena there—the man’s pulse rate, his thought processes, the time he takes to light a cigar, how long it takes to grow up and get old—all these things must be slowed down in the same proportion, because he cannot tell he is moving."
3040,"The biologists and medical men sometimes say it is not quite certain that the time it takes for a cancer to develop will be longer in a space ship, but from the viewpoint of a modern physicist it is nearly certain; otherwise one could use the rate of cancer development to determine the speed of the ship!"
3041,"They come to the earth in cosmic rays, and can also be produced artificially in the laboratory."
3042,"Some of them disintegrate in midair, but the remainder disintegrate only after they encounter a piece of material and stop."
3043,How can that be?
3044,"The answer is that different muons move at various speeds, some of which are very close to the speed of light."
3045,"The average life has been measured quite accurately for muons of different velocities, and the values agree closely with the formula."
3046,"We do not know why the muon disintegrates or what its machinery is, but we do know its behavior satisfies the principle of relativity."
3047,"That is the utility of the principle of relativity—it permits us to make predictions, even about things that otherwise we do not know much about."
3048,"What does this contraction mean, in terms of measurements made by Joe and Moe?"
3049,"In an analogous way, because of the difference in time scales, the denominator expression is introduced into the fourth equation of the Lorentz transformation."
3050,Now what does that mean?
3051,How can the clocks be synchronized?
3052,There are many ways.
3053,"One way, involving very little calculation, would be first to locate exactly the midpoint between the clocks."
3054,"Then from this station we send out a light signal which will go both ways at the same speed and will arrive at both clocks, clearly, at the same time."
3055,This simultaneous arrival of the signals can be used to synchronize the clocks.
3056,Let us see what else we can discover in the Lorentz transformation.
3057,"So the Lorentz transformation is analogous to a rotation, only it is a “rotation” in space and time, which appears to be a strange concept."
3058,"Similarly, Eq."
3059,"(15.9) shows that there is a certain combination which includes time, that is invariant to a Lorentz transformation."
3060,"Thus, the analogy to a rotation is complete, and is of such a kind that vectors, i.e., quantities involving “components” which transform the same way as the coordinates and time, are also useful in connection with relativity."
3061,"Thus we contemplate an extension of the idea of vectors, which we have so far considered to have only space components, to include a time component."
3062,"That is, we expect that there will be vectors with four components, three of which are like the components of an ordinary vector, and with these will be associated a fourth component, which is the analog of the time part."
3063,"This concept will be analyzed further in the next chapters, where we shall find that if the ideas of the preceding paragraph are applied to momentum, the transformation gives three space parts that are like ordinary momentum components, and a fourth component, the time part, which is the energy."
3064,"We are now ready to investigate, more generally, what form the laws of mechanics take under the Lorentz transformation."
3065,15.1).
3066,We shall do this in the next chapter.]
3067,"When this change is made in the formula for momentum, conservation of momentum still works."
3068,Now let us see how momentum varies with speed.
3069,What happens if a constant force acts on a body for a long time?
3070,In Newtonian mechanics the body keeps picking up speed until it goes faster than light.
3071,But this is impossible in relativistic mechanics.
3072,"In relativity, the body keeps picking up, not speed, but momentum, which can continually increase because the mass is increasing."
3073,"After a while there is practically no acceleration in the sense of a change of velocity, but the momentum continues to increase."
3074,"Of course, whenever a force produces very little change in the velocity of a body, we say that the body has a great deal of inertia, and that is exactly what our formula for relativistic mass says (see Eq."
3075,"The light, of course, because light always travels faster.1 How much earlier?"
3076,"When the electrons are going that fast their masses are enormous, but their speed cannot exceed the speed of light."
3077,Now let us look at some further consequences of relativistic change of mass.
3078,Consider the motion of the molecules in a small tank of gas.
3079,"When the gas is heated, the speed of the molecules is increased, and therefore the mass is also increased and the gas is heavier."
3080,If Eq.
3081,"As an interesting result, we shall find the formula (15.1) for the variation of mass with speed, which we have merely assumed up to now."
3082,"Then we apply a force to the body, which starts it moving and gives it kinetic energy; therefore, since the energy has increased, the mass has increased—this is implicit in the original assumption."
3083,"So long as the force continues, the energy and the mass both continue to increase."
3084,"So, Eq."
3085,Since Eq.
3086,Substituting these values into Eq.
3087,(15.12).
3088,This experiment furnishes a direct determination of the energy associated with the existence of the rest mass of a particle.
3089,"In this chapter we shall continue to discuss the principle of relativity of Einstein and Poincaré, as it affects our ideas of physics and other branches of human thought."
3090,"Poincaré made the following statement of the principle of relativity: “According to the principle of relativity, the laws of physical phenomena must be the same for a fixed observer as for an observer who has a uniform motion of translation relative to him, so that we have not, nor can we possibly have, any means of discerning whether or not we are carried along in such a motion.”"
3091,"When this idea descended upon the world, it caused a great stir among philosophers, particularly the “cocktail-party philosophers,” who say, “Oh, it is very simple: Einstein’s theory says all is relative!”  In fact, a surprisingly large number of philosophers, not only those found at cocktail parties (but rather than embarrass them, we shall just call them “cocktail-party philosophers”), will say, “That all is relative is a consequence of Einstein, and it has profound influences on our ideas.” In addition, they say “It has been demonstrated in physics that phenomena depend upon your frame of reference.” We hear that a great deal, but it is difficult to find out what it means."
3092,Probably the frames of reference that were originally referred to were the coordinate systems which we use in the analysis of the theory of relativity.
3093,So the fact that “things depend upon your frame of reference” is supposed to have had a profound effect on modern thought.
3094,"One might well wonder why, because, after all, that things depend upon one’s point of view is so simple an idea that it certainly cannot have been necessary to go to all the trouble of the physical relativity theory in order to discover it."
3095,"That what one sees depends upon his frame of reference is certainly known to anybody who walks around, because he sees an approaching pedestrian first from the front and then from the back; there is nothing deeper in most of the philosophy which is said to have come from the theory of relativity than the remark that “A person looks different from the front than from the back.” The old story about the elephant that several blind men describe in different ways is another example, perhaps, of the theory of relativity from the philosopher’s point of view."
3096,"But certainly there must be deeper things in the theory of relativity than just this simple remark that “A person looks different from the front than from the back.” Of course relativity is deeper than this, because we can make definite predictions with it."
3097,It certainly would be rather remarkable if we could predict the behavior of nature from such a simple observation alone.
3098,"There is another school of philosophers who feel very uncomfortable about the theory of relativity, which asserts that we cannot determine our absolute velocity without looking at something outside, and who would say, “It is obvious that one cannot measure his velocity without looking outside."
3099,"It is self-evident that it is meaningless to talk about the velocity of a thing without looking outside; the physicists are rather stupid for having thought otherwise, but it has just dawned on them that this is the case."
3100,"If only we philosophers had realized what the problems were that the physicists had, we could have decided immediately by brainwork that it is impossible to tell how fast one is moving without looking outside, and we could have made an enormous contribution to physics.” These philosophers are always with us, struggling in the periphery to try to tell us something, but they never really understand the subtleties and depths of the problem."
3101,"Our inability to detect absolute motion is a result of experiment and not a result of plain thought, as we can easily illustrate."
3102,"In the first place, Newton believed that it was true that one could not tell how fast he is going if he is moving with uniform velocity in a straight line."
3103,"In fact, Newton first stated the principle of relativity, and one quotation made in the last chapter was a statement of Newton’s."
3104,"Why then did the philosophers not make all this fuss about “all is relative,” or whatever, in Newton’s time?"
3105,Because it was not until Maxwell’s theory of electrodynamics was developed that there were physical laws that suggested that one could measure his velocity without looking outside; soon it was found experimentally that one could not.
3106,"Now, is it absolutely, definitely, philosophically necessary that one should not be able to tell how fast he is moving without looking outside?"
3107,"One of the consequences of relativity was the development of a philosophy which said, “You can only define what you can measure!"
3108,"Since it is self-evident that one cannot measure a velocity without seeing what he is measuring it relative to, therefore it is clear that there is no meaning to absolute velocity."
3109,"The physicists should have realized that they can talk only about what they can measure.” But that is the whole problem: whether or not one can define absolute velocity is the same as the problem of whether or not one can detect in an experiment, without looking outside, whether he is moving."
3110,"In other words, whether or not a thing is measurable is not something to be decided a priori by thought alone, but something that can be decided only by experiment."
3111,"That is a shocking fact to them; the very ones who claim it is obvious find, when you give them a specific fact, that it is not obvious."
3112,"Finally, there is even a philosophy which says that one cannot detect any motion except by looking outside."
3113,It is simply not true in physics.
3114,"True, one cannot perceive a uniform motion in a straight line, but if the whole room were rotating we would certainly know it, for everybody would be thrown to the wall—there would be all kinds of “centrifugal” effects."
3115,"That the earth is turning on its axis can be determined without looking at the stars, by means of the so-called Foucault pendulum, for example."
3116,Therefore it is not true that “all is relative”; it is only uniform velocity that cannot be detected without looking outside.
3117,Uniform rotation about a fixed axis can be.
3118,"When this is told to a philosopher, he is very upset that he did not really understand it, because to him it seems impossible that one should be able to determine rotation about an axis without looking outside."
3119,"If the philosopher is good enough, after some time he may come back and say, “I understand."
3120,"We really do not have such a thing as absolute rotation; we are really rotating relative to the stars, you see."
3121,And so some influence exerted by the stars on the object must cause the centrifugal force.”
3122,"Now, for all we know, that is true; we have no way, at the present time, of telling whether there would have been centrifugal force if there were no stars and nebulae around."
3123,"We have not been able to do the experiment of removing all the nebulae and then measuring our rotation, so we simply do not know."
3124,We must admit that the philosopher may be right.
3125,"He comes back, therefore, in delight and says, “It is absolutely necessary that the world ultimately turn out to be this way: absolute rotation means nothing; it is only relative to the nebulae.” Then we say to him, “Now, my friend, is it or is it not obvious that uniform velocity in a straight line, relative to the nebulae should produce no effects inside a car?”  Now that the motion is no longer absolute, but is a motion relative to the nebulae, it becomes a mysterious question, and a question that can be answered only by experiment."
3126,"What, then, are the philosophic influences of the theory of relativity?"
3127,"If we limit ourselves to influences in the sense of what kind of new ideas and suggestions are made to the physicist by the principle of relativity, we could describe some of them as follows."
3128,"The first discovery is, essentially, that even those ideas which have been held for a very long time and which have been very accurately verified might be wrong."
3129,"It was a shocking discovery, of course, that Newton’s laws are wrong, after all the years in which they seemed to be accurate."
3130,"Of course it is clear, not that the experiments were wrong, but that they were done over only a limited range of velocities, so small that the relativistic effects would not have been evident."
3131,"But nevertheless, we now have a much more humble point of view of our physical laws—everything can be wrong!"
3132,"Secondly, if we have a set of “strange” ideas, such as that time goes slower when one moves, and so forth, whether we like them or do not like them is an irrelevant question."
3133,The only relevant question is whether the ideas are consistent with what is found experimentally.
3134,"In other words, the “strange ideas” need only agree with experiment, and the only reason that we have to discuss the behavior of clocks and so forth is to demonstrate that although the notion of the time dilation is strange, it is consistent with the way we measure time."
3135,"Finally, there is a third suggestion which is a little more technical but which has turned out to be of enormous utility in our study of other physical laws, and that is to look at the symmetry of the laws or, more specifically, to look for the ways in which the laws can be transformed and leave their form the same."
3136,"When we discussed the theory of vectors, we noted that the fundamental laws of motion are not changed when we rotate the coordinate system, and now we learn that they are not changed when we change the space and time variables in a particular way, given by the Lorentz transformation."
3137,So this idea of studying the patterns or operations under which the fundamental laws are not changed has proved to be a very useful one.
3138,"To continue our discussion of the Lorentz transformation and relativistic effects, we consider a famous so-called “paradox” of Peter and Paul, who are supposed to be twins, born at the same time."
3139,"When they are old enough to drive a space ship, Paul flies away at very high speed."
3140,"Because Peter, who is left on the ground, sees Paul going so fast, all of Paul’s clocks appear to go slower, his heart beats go slower, his thoughts go slower, everything goes slower, from Peter’s point of view."
3141,"Of course, Paul notices nothing unusual, but if he travels around and about for a while and then comes back, he will be younger than Peter, the man on the ground!"
3142,That is actually right; it is one of the consequences of the theory of relativity which has been clearly demonstrated.
3143,"Just as the muons last longer when they are moving, so also will Paul last longer when he is moving."
3144,"This is called a “paradox” only by the people who believe that the principle of relativity means that all motion is relative; they say, “Heh, heh, heh, from the point of view of Paul, can’t we say that Peter was moving and should therefore appear to age more slowly?"
3145,"By symmetry, the only possible result is that both should be the same age when they meet.” But in order for them to come back together and make the comparison, Paul must either stop at the end of the trip and make a comparison of clocks or, more simply, he has to come back, and the one who comes back must be the man who was moving, and he knows this, because he had to turn around."
3146,"When he turned around, all kinds of unusual things happened in his space ship—the rockets went off, things jammed up against one wall, and so on—while Peter felt nothing."
3147,"So the way to state the rule is to say that the man who has felt the accelerations, who has seen things fall against the walls, and so on, is the one who would be the younger; that is the difference between them in an “absolute” sense, and it is certainly correct."
3148,"When we discussed the fact that moving muons live longer, we used as an example their straight-line motion in the atmosphere."
3149,"But we can also make muons in a laboratory and cause them to go in a curve with a magnet, and even under this accelerated motion, they last exactly as much longer as they do when they are moving in a straight line."
3150,"Although no one has arranged an experiment explicitly so that we can get rid of the paradox, one could compare a muon which is left standing with one that had gone around a complete circle, and it would surely be found that the one that went around the circle lasted longer."
3151,"Although we have not actually carried out an experiment using a complete circle, it is really not necessary, of course, because everything fits together all right."
3152,"This may not satisfy those who insist that every single fact be demonstrated directly, but we confidently predict the result of the experiment in which Paul goes in a complete circle."
3153,The main difference between the relativity of Einstein and the relativity of Newton is that the laws of transformation connecting the coordinates and times between relatively moving systems are different.
3154,"Of course other directions of motion are possible, but the most general Lorentz transformation is rather complicated, with all four quantities mixed up together."
3155,"We shall continue to use this simpler form, since it contains all the essential features of relativity."
3156,Let us now discuss more of the consequences of this transformation.
3157,"First, it is interesting to solve these equations in reverse."
3158,"The result is very interesting, since it tells us how a system of coordinates “at rest” looks from the point of view of one that is “moving.” Of course, since the motions are relative and of uniform velocity, the man who is “moving” can say, if he wishes, that it is really the other fellow who is moving and he himself who is at rest."
3159,"And since he is moving in the opposite direction, he should get the same transformation, but with the opposite sign of velocity."
3160,"That is precisely what we find by manipulation, so that is consistent."
3161,"If it did not come out that way, we would have real cause to worry!"
3162,Next we discuss the interesting problem of the addition of velocities in relativity.
3163,This is a special case of the more general problem exemplified by the following.
3164,"This is very unnerving, because it is not supposed to be going faster than the speed of light!"
3165,The general problem is as follows.
3166,"In order to get the velocity as seen by the man on the outside, we must divide his distance by his time, not by the other man’s time!"
3167,Now let us see what happens.
3168,"Suppose that you are moving inside the space ship at half the speed of light, and that the space ship itself is going at half the speed of light."
3169,Let us take a limiting case.
3170,"Just for fun, suppose that inside the space ship the man was observing light itself."
3171,How will it look to the man on the ground?
3172,"This is good, for it is, in fact, what the Einstein theory of relativity was designed to do in the first place—so it had better work!"
3173,"Of course, there are cases in which the motion is not in the direction of the uniform translation."
3174,"We found this result by substituting and combining the transformation equations, but we can also see the result directly from the principle of relativity for the following reason (it is always good to look again to see whether we can see the reason)."
3175,We have already (Fig.
3176,15.3).
3177,16–1).
3178,"This fact must still be true when the whole system is moving, because the physical phenomenon of coincidence will be a coincidence in any frame."
3179,That is why the square root appears in any vertical velocity.
3180,"We learned in the last chapter that the mass of an object increases with velocity, but no demonstration of this was given, in the sense that we made no arguments analogous to those about the way clocks have to behave."
3181,"However, we can show that, as a consequence of relativity plus a few other reasonable assumptions, the mass must vary in this way."
3182,"(We have to say “a few other assumptions” because we cannot prove anything unless we have some laws which we assume to be true, if we expect to make meaningful deductions.)"
3183,"To avoid the need to study the transformation laws of force, we shall analyze a collision, where we need know nothing about the laws of force, except that we shall assume the conservation of momentum and energy."
3184,"Also, we shall assume that the momentum of a particle which is moving is a vector and is always directed in the direction of the velocity."
3185,"However, we shall not assume that the momentum is a constant times the velocity, as Newton did, but only that it is some function of velocity."
3186,"Suppose that we have two particles, like two protons, that are absolutely equal, and they are moving toward each other with exactly equal velocities."
3187,Their total momentum is zero.
3188,Now what can happen?
3189,"After the collision, their directions of motion must be exactly opposite to each other, because if they are not exactly opposite, there will be a nonzero total vector momentum, and momentum would not have been conserved."
3190,"Also they must have the same speeds, since they are exactly similar objects; in fact, they must have the same speed they started with, since we suppose that the energy is conserved in these collisions."
3191,"So the diagram of an elastic collision, a reversible collision, will look like Fig."
3192,"16–2(a): all the arrows are the same length, all the speeds are equal."
3193,"Next, we notice that this same collision can be viewed differently by turning the axes, and just for convenience we shall turn the axes, so that the horizontal splits it evenly, as in Fig."
3194,16–2(b).
3195,"It is the same collision redrawn, only with the axes turned."
3196,Now here is the real trick: let us look at this collision from the point of view of someone riding along in a car that is moving with a speed equal to the horizontal component of the velocity of one particle.
3197,Then how does the collision look?
3198,"That is, the collision appears as shown in Fig."
3199,16–3(a).
3200,"If we knew that, we could get the correct expression for the momentum, using the law of conservation of momentum in the vertical direction."
3201,"But we can get the upward velocity, simply by looking at the same collision going the other way!"
3202,If we look at the collision of Fig.
3203,16–3(b).
3204,16.7).
3205,(16.10) is the right formula for the mass.
3206,"Now, let us accept that momentum is conserved and that the mass depends upon the velocity according to (16.10) and go on to find what else we can conclude."
3207,Let us consider what is commonly called an inelastic collision.
3208,16–4(a).
3209,"If we assume the conservation of momentum and the principle of relativity, we can demonstrate an interesting fact about the mass of the new object which has been formed."
3210,What we see is shown in Fig.
3211,16–4(b).
3212,"Momentum must be conserved, so let us estimate the momentum in the upward direction before and after the collision."
3213,"Astonishing as that may seem, in order for the conservation of momentum to work when two objects come together, the mass that they form must be greater than the rest masses of the objects, even though the objects are at rest after the collision!"
3214,Now we continue this discussion.
3215,"This means, of course, that energy has inertia."
3216,"In the last chapter we discussed the heating of a gas, and showed that because the gas molecules are moving and moving things are heavier, when we put energy into the gas its molecules move faster and so the gas gets heavier."
3217,"But in fact the argument is completely general, and our discussion of the inelastic collision shows that the mass is there whether or not it is kinetic energy."
3218,"In other words, if two particles come together and produce potential or any other form of energy; if the pieces are slowed down by climbing hills, doing work against internal forces, or whatever; then it is still true that the mass is the total energy that has been put in."
3219,"So we see that the conservation of mass which we have deduced above is equivalent to the conservation of energy, and therefore there is no place in the theory of relativity for strictly inelastic collisions, as there was in Newtonian mechanics."
3220,"Of course we know from the law of conservation of energy that there is more kinetic energy inside, but that does not affect the mass, according to Newton’s laws."
3221,"But now we see that this is impossible; because of the kinetic energy involved in the collision, the resulting object will be heavier; therefore, it will be a different object."
3222,"When the mass is different, we can tell that it is different."
3223,"So, necessarily, the conservation of energy must go along with the conservation of momentum in the theory of relativity."
3224,This has interesting consequences.
3225,How much energy will they have given to the material when they have stopped?
3226,"This much energy is left in the material in some form, as heat, potential energy, or whatever."
3227,"This equation was used to estimate how much energy would be liberated under fission in the atomic bomb, for example."
3228,"(Although the fragments are not exactly equal, they are nearly equal.)"
3229,"The mass of the uranium atom was known—it had been measured ahead of time—and the atoms into which it split, iodine, xenon, and so on, all were of known mass."
3230,"By masses, we do not mean the masses while the atoms are moving, we mean the masses when the atoms are at rest."
3231,"Of course, all that meant was that he could tell us ahead of time how much energy would be released if we told him what process would occur."
3232,"The energy that should be liberated when an atom of uranium undergoes fission was estimated about six months before the first direct test, and as soon as the energy was in fact liberated, someone measured it directly (and if Einstein’s formula had not worked, they would have measured it anyway), and the moment they measured it they no longer needed the formula."
3233,"Of course, we should not belittle Einstein, but rather should criticize the newspapers and many popular descriptions of what causes what in the history of physics and technology."
3234,The problem of how to get the thing to occur in an effective and rapid manner is a completely different matter.
3235,The result is just as significant in chemistry.
3236,"For instance, if we were to weigh the carbon dioxide molecule and compare its mass with that of the carbon and the oxygen, we could find out how much energy would be liberated when carbon and oxygen form carbon dioxide."
3237,The only trouble here is that the differences in masses are so small that it is technically very difficult to do.
3238,"But we have discovered, in nature, particles of various kinds which undergo reactions just like the one we have treated above, in which with all the study in the world, we cannot see the parts inside."
3239,"Therefore we have a new idea: we do not have to know what things are made of inside; we cannot and need not identify, inside a particle, which of the energy is rest energy of the parts into which it is going to disintegrate."
3240,The theory of relativity shows us that the relationships of positions and times as measured in one coordinate system and another are not what we would have expected on the basis of our intuitive ideas.
3241,"It is very important that we thoroughly understand the relations of space and time implied by the Lorentz transformation, and therefore we shall consider this matter more deeply in this chapter."
3242,"An analogy is useful: When we look at an object, there is an obvious thing we might call the “apparent width,” and another we might call the “depth.” But the two ideas, width and depth, are not fundamental properties of the object, because if we step aside and look at the same thing from a different angle, we get a different width and a different depth, and we may develop some formulas for computing the new ones from the old ones and the angles involved."
3243,Equations (17.2) are these formulas.
3244,One might say that a given depth is a kind of “mixture” of all depth and all width.
3245,"If it were impossible ever to move, and we always saw a given object from the same position, then this whole business would be irrelevant—we would always see the “true” width and the “true” depth, and they would appear to have quite different qualities, because one appears as a subtended optical angle and the other involves some focusing of the eyes or even intuition; they would seem to be very different things and would never get mixed up."
3246,"It is because we can walk around that we realize that depth and width are, somehow or other, just two different aspects of the same thing."
3247,Can we not look at the Lorentz transformations in the same way?
3248,Here also we have a mixture—of positions and the time.
3249,A difference between a space measurement and a time measurement produces a new space measurement.
3250,"In other words, in the space measurements of one man there is mixed in a little bit of the time, as seen by the other."
3251,"Our analogy permits us to generate this idea: The “reality” of an object that we are looking at is somehow greater (speaking crudely and intuitively) than its “width” and its “depth” because they depend upon how we look at it; when we move to a new position, our brain immediately recalculates the width and the depth."
3252,"But our brain does not immediately recalculate coordinates and time when we move at high speed, because we have had no effective experience of going nearly as fast as light to appreciate the fact that time and space are also of the same nature."
3253,"It is as though we were always stuck in the position of having to look at just the width of something, not being able to move our heads appreciably one way or the other; if we could, we understand now, we would see some of the other man’s time—we would see “behind,” so to speak, a little bit."
3254,"Thus we shall try to think of objects in a new kind of world, of space and time mixed together, in the same sense that the objects in our ordinary space-world are real, and can be looked at from different directions."
3255,"We shall then consider that objects occupying space and lasting for a certain length of time occupy a kind of a “blob” in a new kind of world, and that we look at this “blob” from different points of view when we are moving at different velocities."
3256,"This new world, this geometrical entity in which the “blobs” exist by occupying position and taking up a certain amount of time, is called space-time."
3257,"), and time, vertically."
3258,"Now, how does a moving particle, say, look on such a diagram?"
3259,17–1 a).
3260,17–1 b).
3261,"So a particle, for example, which starts to drift out and then slows up should have a motion something like that shown in Fig."
3262,17–1(c).
3263,"A particle, in other words, which is permanent and does not disintegrate is represented by a line in space-time."
3264,"A particle which disintegrates would be represented by a forked line, because it would turn into two other things which would start from that point."
3265,What about light?
3266,17–1 d).
3267,17–2(a).
3268,"But this is wrong, because Eq."
3269,(17.1) is not exactly the same mathematical transformation as Eq.
3270,(17.2).
3271,"(Of course, it is not impossible that the algebraic quantities could be written as cosine and sine, but actually they cannot.)"
3272,"But still, the two expressions are very similar."
3273,"As we shall see, it is not really possible to think of space-time as a real, ordinary geometry because of that difference in sign."
3274,17–2(b).
3275,"We shall not deal with the geometry, since it does not help much; it is easier to work with the equations."
3276,"Although the geometry of space-time is not Euclidean in the ordinary sense, there is a geometry which is very similar, but peculiar in certain respects."
3277,"If this idea of geometry is right, there ought to be some functions of coordinates and time which are independent of the coordinate system."
3278,"For example, under ordinary rotations, if we take two points, one at the origin, for simplicity, and the other one somewhere else, both systems would have the same origin, and the distance from here to the other point is the same in both."
3279,That is one property that is independent of the particular way of measuring it.
3280,Now what about space-time?
3281,"One of the confusions that could be caused by someone with no experience would be to measure widths, say, by the angle subtended at the eye, and measure depth in a different way, like the strain on the muscles needed to focus them, so that the depths would be measured in feet and the widths in meters."
3282,"Then one would get an enormously complicated mess of equations in making transformations such as (17.2), and would not be able to see the clarity and simplicity of the thing for a very simple technical reason, that the same thing is being measured in two different units."
3283,Now in Eqs.
3284,(17.1) and (17.3) nature is telling us that time and space are equivalent; time becomes space; they should be measured in the     same units.
3285,What distance is a “second”?
3286,It is easy to figure out from (17.3) what it is.
3287,Or another way that we could make the units equal is to measure time in meters.
3288,What is a meter of time?
3289,"If time and space are measured in the same units, as suggested, then the equations are obviously much simplified."
3290,"The difference between space-time and ordinary space, and the character of an interval as related to the distance, is very interesting."
3291,"According to formula (17.5), if we consider a point which in a given coordinate system had zero time, and only space, then the interval squared would be negative and we would have an imaginary interval, the square root of a negative number."
3292,Intervals can be either real or imaginary in the theory.
3293,"The square of an interval may be either positive or negative, unlike distance, which has a positive square."
3294,"When an interval is imaginary, we say that the two points have a space-like interval between them (instead of imaginary), because the interval is more like space than like time."
3295,"On the other hand, if two objects are at the same place in a given coordinate system, but differ only in time, then the square of the time is positive and the distances are zero and the interval squared is positive; this is called a time-like interval."
3296,"Where light goes from a given point is always separated from it by a zero interval, as we see from Eq."
3297,(17.5).
3298,"The space-time region surrounding a given space-time point can be separated into three regions, as shown in Fig."
3299,17–3.
3300,"In one region we have space-like intervals, and in two regions, time-like intervals."
3301,"(Unfortunately, that is the way life is.)"
3302,"So this is the world whose future can be affected by us, and we may call that the affective future."
3303,"What we mean by “right now” is a mysterious thing which we cannot define and we cannot affect, but it can affect us later, or we could have affected it if we had done something far enough in the past."
3304,"When we look at the star Alpha Centauri, we see it as it was four years ago; we might wonder what it is like “now.” “Now” means at the same time from our special coordinate system."
3305,"We can only see Alpha Centauri by the light that has come from our past, up to four years ago, but we do not know what it is doing “now”; it will take four years before what it is doing “now” can affect us."
3306,"Alpha Centauri “now” is an idea or concept of our mind; it is not something that is really definable physically at the moment, because we have to wait to observe it; we cannot even define it right “now.” Furthermore, the “now” depends on the coordinate system."
3307,"If, for example, Alpha Centauri were moving, an observer there would not agree with us because he would put his axes at an angle, and his “now” would be a different time."
3308,We have already talked about the fact that simultaneity is not a unique thing.
3309,"There are fortune tellers, or people who tell us they can know the future, and there are many wonderful stories about the man who suddenly discovers that he has knowledge about the affective future."
3310,"Well, there are lots of paradoxes produced by that because if we know something is going to happen, then we can make sure we will avoid it by doing the right thing at the right time, and so on."
3311,But actually there is no fortune teller who can even tell us the present!
3312,"There is no one who can tell us what is really happening right now, at any reasonable distance, because that is unobservable."
3313,Let us now return to our consideration of the analogy of the Lorentz transformation and rotations of the space axes.
3314,"We have learned the utility of collecting together other quantities which have the same transformation properties as the coordinates, to form what we call vectors, directed lines."
3315,"But, somehow or other, the velocity “itself” has a greater reality than do any of its particular components, and we represent it by a directed line."
3316,"Is it possible, then, to associate with some of our known “three-vectors” a fourth object, that we could call the “time component,” in such a manner that the four objects together would “rotate” the same way as position and time in space-time?"
3317,(17.4).
3318,Now what would the momentum and energy look like in a new coordinate system?
3319,"To find out, we shall have to transform Eq."
3320,"(17.6), which we can do because we know how the velocity transforms."
3321,"(Later, we can do the more general case.)"
3322,(17.10) and (17.11).
3323,To prove this would require our going back and studying the case of motion up and down.
3324,"Actually, we did study the case of motion up and down in the last chapter."
3325,"Since the momentum is a four-vector, it can be represented on a space-time diagram of a moving particle as an “arrow” tangent to the path, as shown in Fig."
3326,17–4.
3327,"This arrow has a time component equal to the energy, and its space components represent its three-vector momentum; this arrow is more “real” than either the energy or the momentum, because those just depend on how we look at the diagram."
3328,The notation for four-vectors is different than it is for three-vectors.
3329,"We could, of course, use any notation we want; do not laugh at notations; invent them, they are powerful."
3330,"In fact, mathematics is, to a large extent, invention of better notations."
3331,"The whole idea of a four-vector, in fact, is an improvement in notation so that the transformations can be remembered easily."
3332,"To add four-vectors, we add the corresponding components."
3333,"If there is an equation among four-vectors, then the equation is true for each component."
3334,This law alone would be impossible in relativity because it is incomplete; it is like talking about only two of the components of a three-vector.
3335,"It is incomplete because if we rotate the axes, we mix the various components, so we must include all three components in our law."
3336,"Thus, in relativity, we must complete the law of conservation of momentum by extending it to include the time component."
3337,"This is absolutely necessary to go with the other three, or there cannot be relativistic invariance."
3338,The conservation of energy is the fourth equation which goes with the conservation of momentum to make a valid four-vector relationship in the geometry of space and time.
3339,"You say, “In which axes?”  It makes no difference."
3340,"The law is true for each component, using any axes."
3341,"In vector analysis we discussed one other thing, the dot product of two vectors."
3342,Let us now consider the corresponding thing in space-time.
3343,17.3).
3344,How can we write that?
3345,"This quantity, then, will be the same in any coordinate system, and we may call it the square of the length of the four-vector."
3346,"For instance, what is the square of the length of the four-vector momentum of a single particle?"
3347,It must be something which is the same in every coordinate system.
3348,"In particular, it must be the same for a coordinate system which is moving right along with the particle, in which the particle is standing still."
3349,"If the particle is standing still, it would have no momentum."
3350,"So in that coordinate system, it is purely its energy, which is the same as its rest mass."
3351,"A photon of light, for example."
3352,"A photon is like a particle, in that it carries an energy and a momentum."
3353,"That is to say, the rest mass is zero."
3354,Let us look at that again; that is quite curious.
3355,"If it is a particle of zero rest mass, what happens when it stops?"
3356,It never stops!
3357,"We cannot say that it is zero; the photon really can (and does) have energy even though it has no rest mass, but this it possesses by perpetually going at the speed of light!"
3358,"The formulas for the energy of a photon as seen from a moving system are, of course, given by Eq."
3359,The different energies after transformation means that there are different frequencies.
3360,"This is called the Doppler effect, and one can calculate it easily from Eq."
3361,"As Minkowski said, “Space of itself, and time of itself will sink into mere shadows, and only a kind of union between them shall survive.”"
3362,"(The photos for chapter 19, which includes the summary for this lecture, are missing from the Caltech Archives.)"
3363,"In the previous chapters we have been studying the mechanics of points, or small particles whose internal structure does not concern us."
3364,For the next few chapters we shall study the application of Newton’s laws to more complicated things.
3365,"When the world becomes more complicated, it also becomes more interesting, and we shall find that the phenomena associated with the mechanics of a more complex object than just a point are really quite striking."
3366,"The more complicated objects we deal with can be of several kinds: water flowing, galaxies whirling, and so on."
3367,"The simplest “complicated” object to analyze, at the start, is what we call a rigid body, a solid object that is turning as it moves about."
3368,"However, even such a simple object may have a most complex motion, and we shall therefore first consider the simplest aspects of such motion, in which an extended body rotates about a fixed axis."
3369,A given point on such a body then moves in a plane perpendicular to this axis.
3370,Such rotation of a body about a fixed axis is called plane rotation or rotation in two dimensions.
3371,"We shall later generalize the results to three dimensions, but in doing so we shall find that, unlike the case of ordinary particle mechanics, rotations are subtle and hard to understand unless we first get a solid grounding in two dimensions."
3372,"The first interesting theorem concerning the motion of complicated objects can be observed at work if we throw an object made of a lot of blocks and spokes, held together by strings, into the air."
3373,"Of course we know it goes in a parabola, because we studied that for a particle."
3374,"But now our object is not a particle; it wobbles and it jiggles, and so on."
3375,It does go in a parabola though; one can see that.
3376,What goes in a parabola?
3377,"Certainly not the point on the corner of the block, because that is jiggling about; neither is it the end of the wooden stick, or the middle of the wooden stick, or the middle of the block."
3378,"But something goes in a parabola, there is an effective “center” which moves in a parabola."
3379,"So our first theorem about complicated objects is to demonstrate that there is a mean position which is mathematically definable, but not necessarily a point of the material itself, which goes in a parabola."
3380,"That is called the theorem of the center of the mass, and the proof of it is as follows."
3381,"We may consider any object as being made of lots of little particles, the atoms, with various forces among them."
3382,"In the next few chapters our moving objects will be ones in which all the parts are moving at speeds very much slower than the speed of light, and we shall use the nonrelativistic approximation for all quantities."
3383,Now the total force on all the particles is the same as the external force.
3384,Why?
3385,"Although there are all kinds of forces on the particles because of the strings, the wigglings, the pullings and pushings, and the atomic forces, and who knows what, and we have to add all these together, we are rescued by Newton’s Third Law."
3386,"Between any two particles the action and reaction are equal, so that when we add all the equations together, if any two particles have forces between them it cancels out in the sum; therefore the net result is only those forces which arise from other particles which are not included in whatever object we decide to sum over."
3387,So if Eq.
3388,"(18.3) is the sum over a certain number of the particles, which together are called “the object,” then the external force on the total object is equal to the sum of all the forces on all its constituent particles."
3389,Now it would be nice if we could write Eq.
3390,(18.3) as the total mass times some acceleration.
3391,We can.
3392,This point is called the center of mass of the body.
3393,"We shall discuss this important theorem in more detail in a later chapter, and we shall therefore limit our remarks to two points: First, if the external forces are zero, if the object were floating in empty space, it might whirl, and jiggle, and twist, and do all kinds of things."
3394,"But the center of mass, this artificially invented, calculated position, somewhere in the middle, will move with a constant velocity."
3395,"In particular, if it is initially at rest, it will stay at rest."
3396,"So if we have some kind of a box, perhaps a space ship, with people in it, and we calculate the location of the center of mass and find it is standing still, then the center of mass will continue to stand still if no external forces are acting on the box."
3397,"Of course, the space ship may move a little in space, but that is because the people are walking back and forth inside; when one walks toward the front, the ship goes toward the back so as to keep the average position of all the masses in exactly the same place."
3398,Is rocket propulsion therefore absolutely impossible because one cannot move the center of mass?
3399,"No; but of course we find that to propel an interesting part of the rocket, an uninteresting part must be thrown away."
3400,"In other words, if we start with a rocket at zero velocity and we spit some gas out the back end, then this little blob of gas goes one way as the rocket ship goes the other, but the center of mass is still exactly where it was before."
3401,So we simply move the part that we are interested in against the part we are not interested in.
3402,"The second point concerning the center of mass, which is the reason we introduced it into our discussion at this time, is that it may be treated separately from the “internal” motions of an object, and may therefore be ignored in our discussion of rotation."
3403,Now let us discuss rotations.
3404,"Of course an ordinary object does not simply rotate, it wobbles, shakes, and bends, so to simplify matters we shall discuss the motion of a nonexistent ideal object which we call a rigid body."
3405,"This means an object in which the forces between the atoms are so strong, and of such character, that the little forces that are needed to move it do not bend it."
3406,Its shape stays essentially the same as it moves about.
3407,"If we wish to study the motion of such a body, and agree to ignore the motion of its center of mass, there is only one thing left for it to do, and that is to turn."
3408,We have to describe that.
3409,How?
3410,"Suppose there is some line in the body which stays put (perhaps it includes the center of mass and perhaps not), and the body is rotating about this particular line as an axis."
3411,How do we define the rotation?
3412,"That is easy enough, for if we mark a point somewhere on the object, anywhere except on the axis, we can always tell exactly where the object is, if we only know where this point has gone to."
3413,The only thing needed to describe the position of that point is an angle.
3414,So rotation consists of a study of the variations of the angle with time.
3415,"In order to study rotation, we observe the angle through which a body has turned."
3416,"Of course, we are not referring to any particular angle inside the object itself; it is not that we draw some angle on the object."
3417,"We are talking about the angular change of the position of the whole thing, from one time to another."
3418,"First, let us study the kinematics of rotations."
3419,"The angle will change with time, and just as we talked about position and velocity in one dimension, we may talk about angular position and angular velocity in plane rotation."
3420,"In fact, there is a very interesting relationship between rotation in two dimensions and one-dimensional displacement, in which almost every quantity has its analog."
3421,"The greater the angular velocity, the faster the object is turning, the faster the angle changes."
3422,That would be the analog of the ordinary acceleration.
3423,"Now of course we shall have to relate the dynamics of rotation to the laws of dynamics of the particles of which the object is made, so we must find out how a particular particle moves when the angular velocity is such and such."
3424,18–1).
3425,Let us now move on to consider the dynamics of rotation.
3426,"Here a new concept, force, must be introduced."
3427,"Let us inquire whether we can invent something which we shall call the torque (L. torquere, to twist) which bears the same relationship to rotation as force does to linear movement."
3428,"A force is the thing that is needed to make linear motion, and the thing that makes something rotate is a “rotary force” or a “twisting force,” i.e., a torque."
3429,"Qualitatively, a torque is a “twist”; what is a torque quantitatively?"
3430,"We shall get to the theory of torques quantitatively by studying the work done in turning an object, for one very nice way of defining a force is to say how much work it does when it acts through a given displacement."
3431,"We are going to try to maintain the analogy between linear and angular quantities by equating the work that we do when we turn something a little bit when there are forces acting on it, to the torque times the angle it turns through."
3432,"In other words, the definition of the torque is going to be so arranged that the theorem of work has an absolute analog: force times distance is work, and torque times angle is going to be work."
3433,That tells us what torque is.
3434,"Consider, for instance, a rigid body of some kind with various forces acting on it, and an axis about which the body rotates."
3435,How much work would be done if we were to turn the object through a very small angle?
3436,That is easy.
3437,This “strange combination” is what we call the torque.
3438,"So, defining the change in work as the torque times the angle, we now have the formula for torque in terms of the forces."
3439,"(Obviously, torque is not a completely new idea independent of Newtonian mechanics—torque must have a definite definition in terms of the force.)"
3440,"Thus torques add by the ordinary laws of algebra, but we shall later see that this is only because we are working in a plane."
3441,"It is like one-dimensional kinematics, where the forces simply add algebraically, but only because they are all in the same direction."
3442,It is more complicated in three dimensions.
3443,"Now we pause briefly to note that our foregoing introduction of torque, through the idea of work, gives us a most important result for an object in equilibrium: if all the forces on an object are in balance both for translation and rotation, not only is the net force zero, but the total of all the torques is also zero, because if an object is in equilibrium, no work is done by the forces for a small displacement."
3444,"So there are two conditions for equilibrium: that the sum of the forces is zero, and that the sum of the torques is zero."
3445,Prove that it suffices to be sure that the sum of torques about any one axis (in two dimensions) is zero.
3446,In Fig.
3447,Therefore we see that the torque is also equal to the tangential component of force (perpendicular to the radius) times the radius.
3448,"That makes sense in terms of our ordinary idea of the torque, because if the force were completely radial, it would not put any “twist” on the body; it is evident that the twisting effect should involve only the part of the force which is not pulling out from the center, and that means the tangential component."
3449,"Furthermore, it is clear that a given force is more effective on a long arm than near the axis."
3450,"In fact, if we take the case where we push right on the axis, we are not twisting at all!"
3451,"So it makes sense that the amount of twist, or torque, is proportional both to the radial distance and to the tangential component of the force."
3452,There is still a third formula for the torque which is very interesting.
3453,18–2.
3454,Therefore the formula for the torque can also be written as the magnitude of the force times the length of the lever arm.
3455,The torque is also often called the moment of the force.
3456,"The origin of this term is obscure, but it may be related to the fact that “moment” is derived from the Latin movimentum, and that the capability of a force to move an object (using the force on a lever or crowbar) increases with the length of the lever arm."
3457,In mathematics “moment” means weighted by how far away it is from an axis.
3458,"Although we have so far considered only the special case of a rigid body, the properties of torques and their mathematical relationships are interesting also even when an object is not rigid."
3459,"To prove this, we shall suppose that there is a system of particles on which there are some forces acting and find out what happens to the system as a result of the torques due to these forces."
3460,"First, of course, we should consider just one particle."
3461,In Fig.
3462,But let us see what the torque does.
3463,"So we have found that there is also a rotational analog for the momentum, and that this analog, the angular momentum, is given by an expression in terms of the components of linear momentum that is just like the formula for torque in terms of the force components!"
3464,"Thus, if we want to know the angular momentum of a particle about an axis, we take only the component of the momentum that is tangential, and multiply it by the radius."
3465,"In other words, what counts for angular momentum is not how fast it is going away from the origin, but how much it is going around the origin."
3466,Only the tangential part of the momentum counts for angular momentum.
3467,"Furthermore, the farther out the line of the momentum extends, the greater the angular momentum."
3468,which is obtained by extending the line of the momentum and finding the perpendicular distance to the axis.
3469,Thus the angular momentum is the magnitude of the momentum times the momentum lever arm.
3470,"Before proceeding to a treatment of more than one particle, let us apply the above results to a planet going around the sun."
3471,In which direction is the force?
3472,The force is toward the sun.
3473,"What, then, is the torque on the object?"
3474,"But there is no tangential force, so there is no torque about an axis at the sun!"
3475,"Therefore, the angular momentum of the planet going around the sun must remain constant."
3476,Let us see what that means.
3477,"The tangential component of velocity, times the mass, times the radius, will be constant, because that is the angular momentum, and the rate of change of the angular momentum is the torque, and, in this problem, the torque is zero."
3478,"Of course since the mass is also a constant, this means that the tangential velocity times the radius is a constant."
3479,But this is something we already knew for the motion of a planet.
3480,18–3)?
3481,How much area will it sweep through?
3482,"In other words, the area that is swept through in unit time will be equal to the velocity times the lever arm of the velocity (times one-half)."
3483,"Thus the rate of change of area is proportional to the angular momentum, which is constant."
3484,"So Kepler’s law about equal areas in equal times is a word description of the statement of the law of conservation of angular momentum, when there is no torque produced by the force."
3485,"Now we shall go on to consider what happens when there is a large number of particles, when an object is made of many pieces with many forces acting between them and on them from the outside."
3486,"Just as the total momentum of an object is the sum of the momenta of all the parts, so the angular momentum is the sum of the angular momenta of all the parts."
3487,There are all those internal forces and all the outside forces to be considered.
3488,"But, if we take Newton’s law of action and reaction to say, not simply that the action and reaction are equal, but also that they are directed exactly oppositely along the same line (Newton may or may not actually have said this, but he tacitly assumed it), then the two torques on the reacting objects, due to their mutual interaction, will be equal and opposite because the lever arms for any axis are equal."
3489,"Therefore the internal torques balance out pair by pair, and so we have the remarkable theorem that the rate of change of the total angular momentum about any axis is equal to the external torque about that axis!"
3490,"This theorem is true for any collection of objects, whether they form a rigid body or not."
3491,"One extremely important case of the above theorem is the law of conservation of angular momentum: if no external torques act upon a system of particles, the angular momentum remains constant."
3492,"A special case of great importance is that of a rigid body, that is, an object of a definite shape that is just turning around."
3493,"Consider an object that is fixed in its geometrical dimensions, and which is rotating about a fixed axis."
3494,Various parts of the object bear the same relationship to one another at all times.
3495,Now let us try to find the total angular momentum of this object.
3496,This is the analog of the law that the momentum is mass times velocity.
3497,"Equations (18.21) and (18.22) say that a body has inertia for turning which depends, not just on the masses, but on how far away they are from the axis."
3498,"So, if we have two objects of the same mass, when we put the masses farther away from the axis, the inertia for turning will be higher."
3499,This is easily demonstrated by the apparatus shown in Fig.
3500,"The moment of inertia is the inertia against turning, and is the sum of the contributions of all the masses, times their distances squared, from the axis."
3501,There is one important difference between mass and moment of inertia which is very dramatic.
3502,"The mass of an object never changes, but its moment of inertia can be changed."
3503,"If we stand on a frictionless rotatable stand with our arms outstretched, and hold some weights in our hands as we rotate slowly, we may change our moment of inertia by drawing our arms in, but our mass does not change."
3504,"When we do this, all kinds of wonderful things happen, because of the law of the conservation of angular momentum: If the external torque is zero, then the angular momentum, the moment of inertia times omega, remains constant."
3505,"That is, if we reduce the moment of inertia, we have to increase the angular velocity."
3506,Let us now discuss the center of mass in a little more detail.
3507,But suppose one of them were twice as heavy as the others.
3508,"It does not have to be in the material of the body, for the body could be a circle, like a hoop, and the center of mass is in the center of the hoop, not in the hoop itself."
3509,"Of course, if an object is symmetrical in some way, for instance, a rectangle, so that it has a plane of symmetry, the center of mass lies somewhere on the plane of symmetry."
3510,"In the case of a rectangle there are two planes, and that locates it uniquely."
3511,Another interesting proposition is the following very curious one.
3512,19–1).
3513,Then the center of mass of the whole object can be calculated as follows.
3514,The center of mass of these two point masses is then the center of mass of the whole object.
3515,"In other words, if the centers of mass of various parts of an object have been worked out, we do not have to start all over again to find the center of mass of the whole object; we just have to put the pieces together, treating each one as a point mass situated at the center of mass of that piece."
3516,Let us see why that is.
3517,"The theorem concerning the motion of the center of mass is very interesting, and has played an important part in the development of our understanding of physics."
3518,Suppose we assume that Newton’s law is right for the small component parts of a much larger object.
3519,"Then this theorem shows that Newton’s law is also correct for the larger object, even if we do not study the details of the object, but only the total force acting on it and its mass."
3520,"In other words, Newton’s law has the peculiar property that if it is right on a certain small scale, then it will be right on a larger scale."
3521,"(There ought to be a good word, out of the Greek, perhaps, to describe a law which reproduces the same law on a larger scale.)"
3522,"Of course, one might suspect that the first laws that would be discovered by human beings would be those that would reproduce themselves on a larger scale."
3523,Why?
3524,"Because the actual scale of the fundamental gears and wheels of the universe are of atomic dimensions, which are so much finer than our observations that we are nowhere near that scale in our ordinary observations."
3525,So the first things that we would discover must be true for objects of no special size relative to an atomic scale.
3526,"If the laws for small particles did not reproduce themselves on a larger scale, we would not discover those laws very easily."
3527,What about the reverse problem?
3528,Must the laws on a small scale be the same as those on a larger scale?
3529,"Of course it is not necessarily so in nature, that at an atomic level the laws have to be the same as on a large scale."
3530,"Suppose that the true laws of motion of atoms were given by some strange equation which does not have the property that when we go to a larger scale we reproduce the same law, but instead has the property that if we go to a larger scale, we can approximate it by a certain expression such that, if we extend that expression up and up, it keeps reproducing itself on a larger and larger scale."
3531,"That is possible, and in fact that is the way it works."
3532,"Newton’s laws are the “tail end” of the atomic laws, extrapolated to a very large size."
3533,"The actual laws of motion of particles on a fine scale are very peculiar, but if we take large numbers of them and compound them, they approximate, but only approximate, Newton’s laws."
3534,"Newton’s laws then permit us to go on to a higher and higher scale, and it still seems to be the same law."
3535,"In fact, it becomes more and more accurate as the scale gets larger and larger."
3536,"This self-reproducing factor of Newton’s laws is thus really not a fundamental feature of nature, but is an important historical feature."
3537,We would never discover the fundamental laws of the atomic particles at first observation because the first observations are much too crude.
3538,"In fact, it turns out that the fundamental atomic laws, which we call quantum mechanics, are quite different from Newton’s laws, and are difficult to understand because all our direct experiences are with large-scale objects and the small-scale atoms behave like nothing we see on a large scale."
3539,"So we cannot say, “An atom is just like a planet going around the sun,” or anything like that."
3540,It is like nothing we are familiar with because there is nothing like it.
3541,"As we apply quantum mechanics to larger and larger things, the laws about the behavior of many atoms together do not reproduce themselves, but produce new laws, which are Newton’s laws, which then continue to reproduce themselves from, say, micro-microgram size, which still is billions and billions of atoms, on up to the size of the earth, and above."
3542,Let us now return to the center of mass.
3543,"The center of mass is sometimes called the center of gravity, for the reason that, in many cases, gravity may be considered uniform."
3544,"Let us suppose that we have small enough dimensions that the gravitational force is not only proportional to the mass, but is everywhere parallel to some fixed line."
3545,Then consider an object in which there are gravitational forces on each of its constituent masses.
3546,"Now the question is, where can we apply a single force to balance the gravitational force on the whole thing, so that the entire object, if it is a rigid body, will not turn?"
3547,"The answer is that this force must go through the center of mass, and we show this in the following way."
3548,"In order that the body will not turn, the torque produced by all the forces must add up to zero, because if there is a torque, there is a change of angular momentum, and thus a rotation."
3549,"So we must calculate the total of all the torques on all the particles, and see how much torque there is about any given axis; it should be zero if this axis is at the center of mass."
3550,"In other words, when an object is supported at its center of mass, there is no torque on it because of a parallel gravitational field."
3551,"In case the object is so large that the nonparallelism of the gravitational forces is significant, then the center where one must apply the balancing force is not simple to describe, and it departs slightly from the center of mass."
3552,That is why one must distinguish between the center of mass and the center of gravity.
3553,The fact that an object supported exactly at the center of mass will balance in all positions has another interesting consequence.
3554,"If, instead of gravitation, we have a pseudo force due to acceleration, we may use exactly the same mathematical procedure to find the position to support it so that there are no torques produced by the inertial force of acceleration."
3555,"Suppose that the object is held in some manner inside a box, and that the box, and everything contained in it, is accelerating."
3556,"We know that, from the point of view of someone at rest relative to this accelerating box, there will be an effective force due to inertia."
3557,"That is, to make the object go along with the box, we have to push on it to accelerate it, and this force is “balanced” by the “force of inertia,” which is a pseudo force equal to the mass times the acceleration of the box."
3558,Thus the inertial force due to accelerating an object has no torque about the center of mass.
3559,This fact has a very interesting consequence.
3560,"In an inertial frame that is not accelerating, the torque is always equal to the rate of change of the angular momentum."
3561,"However, about an axis through the center of mass of an object which is accelerating, it is still true that the torque is equal to the rate of change of the angular momentum."
3562,"Even if the center of mass is accelerating, we may still choose one special axis, namely, one passing through the center of mass, such that it will still be true that the torque is equal to the rate of change of angular momentum around that axis."
3563,"Thus the theorem that torque equals the rate of change of angular momentum is true in two general cases: (1) a fixed axis in inertial space, (2) an axis through the center of mass, even though the object may be accelerating."
3564,"The mathematical techniques for the calculation of centers of mass are in the province of a mathematics course, and such problems provide good exercise in integral calculus."
3565,"After one has learned calculus, however, and wants to know how to locate centers of mass, it is nice to know certain tricks which can be used to do so."
3566,One such trick makes use of what is called the theorem of Pappus.
3567,"It works like this: if we take any closed area in a plane and generate a solid by moving it through space such that each point is always moved perpendicular to the plane of the area, the resulting solid has a total volume equal to the area of the cross section times the distance that the center of mass moved!"
3568,"Certainly this is true if we move the area in a straight line perpendicular to itself, but if we move it in a circle or in some other curve, then it generates a rather peculiar volume."
3569,"For a curved path, the outside goes around farther, and the inside goes around less, and these effects balance out."
3570,"So if we want to locate the center of mass of a plane sheet of uniform density, we can remember that the volume generated by spinning it about an axis is the distance that the center of mass goes around, times the area of the sheet."
3571,"19–2), we might solve the problem in the following way."
3572,This generates a cone.
3573,"In fact, the center of mass of any uniform triangular area is where the three medians, the lines from the vertices through the centers of the opposite sides, all meet."
3574,"Clue: Slice the triangle up into a lot of little pieces, each parallel to a base."
3575,"Note that the median line bisects every piece, and therefore the center of mass must lie on this line."
3576,Now let us try a more complicated figure.
3577,Suppose that it is desired to find the position of the center of mass of a uniform semicircular disc—a disc sliced in half.
3578,Where is the center of mass?
3579,"For a full disc, it is at the center, of course, but a half-disc is more difficult."
3580,Spin it around this edge as axis to generate a sphere.
3581,"There is another theorem of Pappus which is a special case of the above one, and therefore equally true."
3582,"Suppose that, instead of the solid semicircular disc, we have a semicircular piece of wire with uniform mass density along the wire, and we want to find its center of mass."
3583,"In this case there is no mass in the interior, only on the wire."
3584,"Then it turns out that the area which is swept by a plane curved line, when it moves as before, is the distance that the center of mass moves times the length of the line."
3585,"(The line can be thought of as a very narrow area, and the previous theorem can be applied to it.)"
3586,Now let us discuss the problem of finding the moments of inertia of various objects.
3587,"Note that it is not the three-dimensional distance, only the two-dimensional distance squared, even for a three-dimensional object."
3588,"As a simple example, consider a rod rotating about a perpendicular axis through one end (Fig."
3589,19–3).
3590,But let us notice a few things about the moment of inertia.
3591,"Of course, we could go on to compute the moments of inertia of various other bodies of interest."
3592,"However, while such computations provide a certain amount of important exercise in the calculus, they are not basically of interest to us as such."
3593,"There is, however, an interesting theorem which is very useful."
3594,"Suppose we have an object, and we want to find its moment of inertia around some axis."
3595,That means we want the inertia needed to carry it by rotation about that axis.
3596,"This theorem is called the parallel-axis theorem, and may be easily proved."
3597,Thus we arrive at Eq.
3598,"(19.7), just as we guessed."
3599,Let us check (19.7) for one example.
3600,Let us just see whether it works for the rod.
3601,"Since one-quarter plus one-twelfth is one-third, we have made no fundamental error."
3602,"Incidentally, we did not really need to use an integral to find the moment of inertia (19.5)."
3603,There is always another way to do it!
3604,One further property of the moment of inertia is worth mentioning because it is often helpful in finding the moment of inertia of certain kinds of objects.
3605,"The moments of inertia of a number of elementary shapes having uniform mass densities are given in Table 19–1, and the moments of inertia of some other objects, which may be deduced from Table 19–1, using the above properties, are given in Table 19–2."
3606,Now let us go on to discuss dynamics further.
3607,"In the analogy between linear motion and angular motion that we discussed in Chapter 18, we used the work theorem, but we did not talk about kinetic energy."
3608,We can immediately guess the correct answer by using our analogies.
3609,"At the end of Chapter 18 we pointed out that there are some interesting phenomena associated with an object which is not rigid, but which changes from one rigid condition with a definite moment of inertia, to another rigid condition."
3610,Now what about the energy?
3611,That is an interesting question.
3612,"With our arms pulled in, we turn faster, but our moment of inertia is less, and it looks as though the energies might be equal."
3613,"So we had a certain energy when our arms were out, and when we pulled them in, we were turning faster and had more kinetic energy."
3614,What happened to the theorem of the conservation of energy?
3615,Somebody must have done some work.
3616,We did work!
3617,When did we do any work?
3618,"When we move a weight horizontally, we do not do any work."
3619,"If we hold a thing out and pull it in, we do not do any work."
3620,But that is when we are not rotating!
3621,"When we are rotating, there is centrifugal force on the weights."
3622,"They are trying to fly out, so when we are going around we have to pull the weights in against the centrifugal force."
3623,"So, the work we do against the centrifugal force ought to agree with the difference in rotational energy, and of course it does."
3624,That is where the extra kinetic energy comes from.
3625,"There is still another interesting feature which we can treat only descriptively, as a matter of general interest."
3626,"This feature is a little more advanced, but is worth pointing out because it is quite curious and produces many interesting effects."
3627,Consider that turntable experiment again.
3628,"Consider the body and the arms separately, from the point of view of the man who is rotating."
3629,"After the weights are pulled in, the whole object is spinning faster, but observe, the central part of the body is not changed, yet it is turning faster after the event than before."
3630,"So, if we were to draw a circle around the inner body, and consider only objects inside the circle, their angular momentum would change; they are going faster."
3631,Therefore there must be a torque exerted on the body while we pull in our arms.
3632,"No torque can be exerted by the centrifugal force, because that is radial."
3633,"So that means that among the forces that are developed in a rotating system, centrifugal force is not the entire story, there is another force."
3634,"This other force is called Coriolis force, and it has the very strange property that when we move something in a rotating system, it seems to be pushed sidewise."
3635,"Like the centrifugal force, it is an apparent force."
3636,"But if we live in a system that is rotating, and move something radially, we find that we must also push it sidewise to move it radially."
3637,This sidewise push which we have to exert is what turned our body around.
3638,Now let us develop a formula to show how this Coriolis force really works.
3639,Suppose Moe is sitting on a carousel that appears to him to be stationary.
3640,"But from the point of view of Joe, who is standing on the ground and who knows the right laws of mechanics, the carousel is going around."
3641,"Suppose that we have drawn a radial line on the carousel, and that Moe is moving some mass radially along this line."
3642,We would like to demonstrate that a sidewise force is required to do that.
3643,We can do this by paying attention to the angular momentum of the mass.
3644,"(To walk along the radius in a carousel, one has to lean over and push sidewise."
3645,Try it sometime.)
3646,"Now that we have a formula for the Coriolis force, let us look at the situation a little more carefully, to see whether we can understand the origin of this force from a more elementary point of view."
3647,"We note that the Coriolis force is the same at every radius, and is evidently present even at the origin!"
3648,"But it is especially easy to understand it at the origin, just by looking at what happens from the inertial system of Joe, who is standing on the ground."
3649,This is the Coriolis force.
3650,This is not the only case in which the Coriolis force occurs.
3651,"We can also show that if an object is moving with constant speed around the circumference of a circle, there is also a Coriolis force."
3652,Why?
3653,"Now from Moe’s point of view, this centripetal force has three pieces."
3654,Let us try to understand it.
3655,Would Moe appreciate the first term?
3656,"In addition, Moe is quite aware that there is another centripetal force that would act even on objects which are standing still on his carousel."
3657,This is the third term.
3658,"In fact, one expression has a minus sign relative to the other."
3659,"The force is always in the same direction, relative to the velocity, no matter in which direction the velocity is."
3660,"In this chapter we shall discuss one of the most remarkable and amusing consequences of mechanics, the behavior of a rotating wheel."
3661,"In order to do this we must first extend the mathematical formulation of rotational motion, the principles of angular momentum, torque, and so on, to three-dimensional space."
3662,"We shall not use these equations in all their generality and study all their consequences, because this would take many years, and we must soon turn to other subjects."
3663,In an introductory course we can present only the fundamental laws and apply them to a very few situations of special interest.
3664,"First, we notice that if we have a rotation in three dimensions, whether of a rigid body or any other system, what we deduced for two dimensions is still right."
3665,"This being true, we can use any other pair of axes and get another equation."
3666,That these three equations can be deduced for the motion of a single particle is quite clear.
3667,Thus we would have laws that the external torque associated with any plane is equal to the rate of change of the angular momentum associated with that plane.
3668,This is just a generalization of what we wrote in two dimensions.
3669,"But now one may say, “Ah, but there are more planes; after all, can we not take some other plane at some angle, and calculate the torque on that plane from the forces?"
3670,There is nothing new.
3671,This property we shall now analyze.
3672,He therefore has new torques and angular momenta which he would work out.
3673,"What we must now do is to find the relationship between the new torques and the old torques, so we will be able to make a connection from one set of axes to the other."
3674,"Someone may say, “That looks just like what we did with vectors.” And indeed, that is exactly what we are intending to do."
3675,"Then he may say, “Well, isn’t torque just a vector?” It does turn out to be a vector, but we do not know that right away without making an analysis."
3676,So in the following steps we shall make the analysis.
3677,"We shall not discuss every step in detail, since we only want to illustrate how it works."
3678,We digress at this point to note that in such cases as this one may get the wrong sign for some quantity if the coordinates are not handled in the right way.
3679,   or
3680,"It is merely the relationship between the axes used by one man and the axes used by the other, and is supposedly constant.)"
3681,"We wanted to get a rule for finding torques in new axes in terms of torques in old axes, and now we have the rule."
3682,How can we ever remember that rule?
3683,"Although a torque is a twist on a plane, and it has no a priori vector character, mathematically it does behave like a vector."
3684,"This vector is at right angles to the plane of the twist, and its length is proportional to the strength of the twist."
3685,The three components of such a quantity will transform like a real vector.
3686,"So we represent torques by vectors; with each plane on which the torque is supposed to be acting, we associate a line at right angles, by a rule."
3687,But “at right angles” leaves the sign unspecified.
3688,"That is, somebody has to define “right” and “left” for us."
3689,Why is torque a vector?
3690,"It is a miracle of good luck that we can associate a single axis with a plane, and therefore that we can associate a vector with the torque; it is a special property of three-dimensional space."
3691,"In two dimensions, the torque is an ordinary scalar, and there need be no direction associated with it."
3692,"In three dimensions, it is a vector."
3693,"There would be six of them, and one cannot represent six quantities as one vector in four dimensions."
3694,"We have then, in addition to the ordinary scalar product in the theory of vector analysis, a new kind of product, called the vector product."
3695,Of course the relationship in components is given in Eq.
3696,(20.9) and from that one can determine what the relationship is in geometry.
3697,; these are ordinary polar vectors.
3698,Vectors which involve just one cross product in their definition are called axial vectors or pseudo vectors.
3699,"In order to complete the mathematical properties of vectors, we should know all the rules for their multiplication, using dot and cross products."
3700,"In our applications at the moment, we will need very little of this, but for the sake of completeness we shall write down all of the rules for vector multiplication so that we can use the results later."
3701,Now let us ask whether any equations in physics can be written using the cross product.
3702,"The answer, of course, is that a great many equations can be so written."
3703,"Another theorem: If the total external torque is zero, then the total vector angular momentum of the system is a constant."
3704,This is called the law of conservation of angular momentum.
3705,"If there is no torque on a given system, its angular momentum cannot change."
3706,What about angular velocity?
3707,Is it a vector?
3708,"We have already discussed turning a solid object about a fixed axis, but for a moment suppose that we are turning it simultaneously about two axes."
3709,"It might be turning about an axis inside a box, while the box is turning about some other axis."
3710,The net result of such combined motions is that the object simply turns about some new axis!
3711,The wonderful thing about this new axis is that it can be figured out this way.
3712,"That is to say, simply, angular velocity is a vector, where we draw the magnitudes of the rotations in the three planes as projections at right angles to those planes.1"
3713,"As a simple application of the use of the angular velocity vector, we may evaluate the power being expended by the torque acting on a rigid body."
3714,All the formulas that we wrote for plane rotation can be generalized to three dimensions.
3715,Let us now return to the law of conservation of angular momentum.
3716,"This law may be demonstrated with a rapidly spinning wheel, or gyroscope, as follows (see Fig."
3717,20–1).
3718,"If we sit on a swivel chair and hold the spinning wheel with its axis horizontal, the wheel has an angular momentum about the horizontal axis."
3719,"Angular momentum around a vertical axis cannot change because of the (frictionless) pivot of the chair, so if we turn the axis of the wheel into the vertical, then the wheel would have angular momentum about the vertical axis, because it is now spinning about this axis."
3720,"But the system (wheel, ourself, and chair) cannot have a vertical component, so we and the chair have to turn in the direction opposite to the spin of the wheel, to balance it."
3721,First let us analyze in more detail the thing we have just described.
3722,"What is surprising, and what we must understand, is the origin of the forces which turn us and the chair around as we turn the axis of the gyroscope toward the vertical."
3723,"Therefore its angular velocity is about that axis and, it turns out, its angular momentum is likewise in that direction."
3724,"Since the major part of the angular momentum is due to the spin on the axis (very little is contributed by the slow turning), we see that the angular momentum vector has changed."
3725,What is the change in angular momentum?
3726,How are these forces applied?
3727,"By our hands, as we try to rotate the axis of the wheel into the vertical direction."
3728,But Newton’s Third Law demands that equal and opposite forces (and equal and opposite torques) act on us.
3729,This result can be generalized for a rapidly spinning top.
3730,"In the familiar case of a spinning top, gravity acting on its center of mass furnishes a torque about the point of contact with the floor (see Fig."
3731,20–3).
3732,"This torque is in the horizontal direction, and causes the top to precess with its axis moving in a circular cone about the vertical."
3733,"We may now claim to understand the precession of gyroscopes, and indeed we do, mathematically."
3734,"However, this is a mathematical thing which, in a sense, appears as a “miracle.” It will turn out, as we go to more and more advanced physics, that many simple things can be deduced mathematically more rapidly than they can be really understood in a fundamental or simple sense."
3735,"This is a strange characteristic, and as we get into more and more advanced work there are circumstances in which mathematics will produce results which no one has really been able to understand in any direct fashion."
3736,"An example is the Dirac equation, which appears in a very simple and beautiful form, but whose consequences are hard to understand."
3737,"In our particular case, the precession of a top looks like some kind of a miracle involving right angles and circles, and twists and right-hand screws."
3738,What we should try to do is to understand it in a more physical way.
3739,How can we explain the torque in terms of the real forces and the accelerations?
3740,"We note that when the wheel is precessing, the particles that are going around the wheel are not really moving in a plane because the wheel is precessing (see Fig."
3741,20–4).
3742,As we explained previously (Fig.
3743,"19–4), the particles which are crossing through the precession axis are moving in curved paths, and this requires application of a lateral force."
3744,"This is supplied by our pushing on the axle, which then communicates the force to the rim through the spokes."
3745,"“Wait,” someone says, “what about the particles that are going back on the other side?” It does not take long to decide that there must be a force in the opposite direction on that side."
3746,The net force that we have to apply is therefore zero.
3747,"The forces balance out, but one of them must be applied at one side of the wheel, and the other must be applied at the other side of the wheel."
3748,"We could apply these forces directly, but because the wheel is solid we are allowed to do it by pushing on the axle, since forces can be carried up through the spokes."
3749,"What we have so far proved is that if the wheel is precessing, it can balance the torque due to gravity or some other applied torque."
3750,But all we have shown is that this is a solution of an equation.
3751,"That is, if the torque is given, and if we get the spinning started right, then the wheel will precess smoothly and uniformly."
3752,But we have not proved (and it is not true) that a uniform precession is the most general motion a spinning body can undergo as the result of a given torque.
3753,The general motion involves also a “wobbling” about the mean precession.
3754,This “wobbling” is called nutation.
3755,"Some people like to say that when one exerts a torque on a gyroscope, it turns and it precesses, and that the torque produces the precession."
3756,"It is very strange that when one suddenly lets go of a gyroscope, it does not fall under the action of gravity, but moves sidewise instead!"
3757,"Why is it that the downward force of the gravity, which we know and feel, makes it go sidewise?"
3758,"All the formulas in the world like (20.15) are not going to tell us, because (20.15) is a special equation, valid only after the gyroscope is precessing nicely."
3759,"What really happens, in detail, is the following."
3760,"If we were to hold the axis absolutely fixed, so that it cannot precess in any manner (but the top is spinning) then there is no torque acting, not even a torque from gravity, because it is balanced by our fingers."
3761,"But if we suddenly let go, then there will instantaneously be a torque from gravity."
3762,"Anyone in his right mind would think that the top would fall, and that is what it starts to do, as can be seen if the top is not spinning too fast."
3763,"The gyro actually does fall, as we would expect."
3764,"But as soon as it falls, it is then turning, and if this turning were to continue, a torque would be required."
3765,"In the absence of a torque in this direction, the gyro begins to “fall” in the direction opposite that of the missing force."
3766,"This gives the gyro a component of motion around the vertical axis, as it would have in steady precession."
3767,"But the actual motion “overshoots” the steady precessional velocity, and the axis actually rises again to the level from which it started."
3768,The path followed by the end of the axle is a cycloid (the path followed by a pebble that is stuck in the tread of an automobile tire).
3769,"Ordinarily, this motion is too quick for the eye to follow, and it damps out quickly because of the friction in the gimbal bearings, leaving only the steady precessional drift (Fig."
3770,20–5).
3771,"The slower the wheel spins, the more obvious the nutation is."
3772,"When the motion settles down, the axis of the gyro is a little bit lower than it was at the start."
3773,Why?
3774,"(These are the more complicated details, but we bring them in because we do not want the reader to get the idea that the gyroscope is an absolute miracle."
3775,"It is a wonderful thing, but it is not a miracle.)"
3776,"If we were holding the axis absolutely horizontally, and suddenly let go, then the simple precession equation would tell us that it precesses, that it goes around in a horizontal plane."
3777,But that is impossible!
3778,"Although we neglected it before, it is true that the wheel has some moment of inertia about the precession axis, and if it is moving about that axis, even slowly, it has a weak angular momentum about the axis."
3779,Where did it come from?
3780,"If the pivots are perfect, there is no torque about the vertical axis."
3781,How then does it get to precess if there is no change in the angular momentum?
3782,"The answer is that the cycloidal motion of the end of the axis damps down to the average, steady motion of the center of the equivalent rolling circle."
3783,"That is, it settles down a little bit low."
3784,"Because it is low, the spin angular momentum now has a small vertical component, which is exactly what is needed for the precession."
3785,"So you see it has to go down a little, in order to go around."
3786,"It has to yield a little bit to the gravity; by turning its axis down a little bit, it maintains the rotation about the vertical axis."
3787,"That, then, is the way a gyroscope works."
3788,"Before we leave the subject of rotations in three dimensions, we shall discuss, at least qualitatively, a few effects that occur in three-dimensional rotations that are not self-evident."
3789,"The main effect is that, in general, the angular momentum of a rigid body is not necessarily in the same direction as the angular velocity."
3790,"Consider a wheel that is fastened onto a shaft in a lopsided fashion, but with the axis through the center of gravity, to be sure (Fig."
3791,20–6).
3792,"When we spin the wheel around the axis, anybody knows that there will be shaking at the bearings because of the lopsided way we have it mounted."
3793,"Qualitatively, we know that in the rotating system there is centrifugal force acting on the wheel, trying to throw its mass as far as possible from the axis."
3794,This tends to line up the plane of the wheel so that it is perpendicular to the axis.
3795,"To resist this tendency, a torque is exerted by the bearings."
3796,"If there is a torque exerted by the bearings, there must be a rate of change of angular momentum."
3797,How can there be a rate of change of angular momentum when we are simply turning the wheel about the axis?
3798,What is the angular momentum?
3799,"The moments of inertia about these two axes are different, so the angular momentum components, which (in these particular, special axes only) are equal to the moments of inertia times the corresponding angular velocity components, are in a different ratio than are the angular velocity components."
3800,Therefore the angular momentum vector is in a direction in space not along the axis.
3801,"When we turn the object, we have to turn the angular momentum vector in space, so we must exert torques on the shaft."
3802,"Although it is much too complicated to prove here, there is a very important and interesting property of the moment of inertia which is easy to describe and to use, and which is the basis of our above analysis."
3803,"This property is the following: Any rigid body, even an irregular one like a potato, possesses three mutually perpendicular axes through the CM, such that the moment of inertia about one of these axes has the greatest possible value for any axis through the CM, the moment of inertia about another of the axes has the minimum possible value, and the moment of inertia about the third axis is intermediate between these two (or equal to one of them)."
3804,"These axes are called the principal axes of the body, and they have the important property that if the body is rotating about one of them, its angular momentum is in the same direction as the angular velocity."
3805,"For a body having axes of symmetry, the principal axes are along the symmetry axes."
3806,"In the study of physics, usually the course is divided into a series of subjects, such as mechanics, electricity, optics, etc., and one studies one subject after the other."
3807,"For example, this course has so far dealt mostly with mechanics."
3808,"But a strange thing occurs again and again: the equations which appear in different fields of physics, and even in other sciences, are often almost exactly the same, so that many phenomena have analogs in these different fields."
3809,"To take the simplest example, the propagation of sound waves is in many ways analogous to the propagation of light waves."
3810,If we study acoustics in great detail we discover that much of the work is the same as it would be if we were studying optics in great detail.
3811,So the study of a phenomenon in one field may permit an extension of our knowledge in another field.
3812,"It is best to realize from the first that such extensions are possible, for otherwise one might not understand the reason for spending a great deal of time and energy on what appears to be only a small part of mechanics."
3813,"The harmonic oscillator, which we are about to study, has close analogs in many other fields; although we start with a mechanical example of a weight on a spring, or a pendulum with a small swing, or certain other mechanical devices, we are really studying a certain differential equation."
3814,"This equation appears again and again in physics and in other sciences, and in fact it is a part of so many phenomena that its close study is well worth our while."
3815,"Some of the phenomena involving this equation are the oscillations of a mass on a spring; the oscillations of charge flowing back and forth in an electrical circuit; the vibrations of a tuning fork which is generating sound waves; the analogous vibrations of the electrons in an atom, which generate light waves; the equations for the operation of a servosystem, such as a thermostat trying to adjust a temperature; complicated interactions in chemical reactions; the growth of a colony of bacteria in interaction with the food supply and the poisons the bacteria produce; foxes eating rabbits eating grass, and so on; all these phenomena follow equations which are very similar to one another, and this is the reason why we study the mechanical oscillator in such detail."
3816,The equations are called linear differential equations with constant coefficients.
3817,"A linear differential equation with constant coefficients is a differential equation consisting of a sum of several terms, each term being a derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable, and multiplied by some constant."
3818,"Perhaps the simplest mechanical system whose motion follows a linear differential equation with constant coefficients is a mass on a spring: first the spring stretches to balance the gravity; once it is balanced, we then discuss the vertical displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position (Fig."
3819,21–1).
3820,We have already analyzed Eq.
3821,(21.3) in detail numerically; when we first introduced the subject of mechanics we solved this equation (see Eq.
3822,9.12) to find the motion.
3823,By numerical integration we found a curve (Fig.
3824,"We assume that in the meantime the Mathematics Department has brought forth a function which, when differentiated twice, is equal to itself with a minus sign."
3825,"(There are, of course, ways of getting at this function in a direct fashion, but they are more complicated than already knowing what the answer is.)"
3826,"We were wrong in the last figure because of the errors of numerical analysis, but it was very close!"
3827,"Now to go further with the original problem, we restore the time units to real seconds."
3828,What is the solution then?
3829,Thus we discover to our horror that we did not succeed in solving Eq.
3830,"(21.2), but we got Eq."
3831,(21.3) again!
3832,"That fact illustrates one of the most important properties of linear differential equations: if we multiply a solution of the equation by any constant, it is again a solution."
3833,The mathematical reason for this is clear.
3834,The physics of it is the following.
3835,"If we have a weight on a spring, and pull it down twice as far, the force is twice as much, the resulting acceleration is twice as great, the velocity it acquires in a given time is twice as great, the distance covered in a given time is twice as great; but it has to cover twice as great a distance in order to get back to the origin because it is pulled down twice as far."
3836,"So it takes the same time to get back to the origin, irrespective of the initial displacement."
3837,"In other words, with a linear equation, the motion has the same time pattern, no matter how “strong” it is."
3838,"That was the wrong thing to do—it only taught us that we can multiply the solution by anything, and it satisfies the same equation, but not a different equation."
3839,"In other words, Eq."
3840,Now we try Eq.
3841,So at last we have solved the equation that we really wanted to solve.
3842,"That is because it has more inertia, and so, while the forces are the same, it takes longer to get the mass moving."
3843,"Or, if the spring is stronger, it will move more quickly, and that is right: the period is less if the spring is stronger."
3844,"Note that the period of oscillation of a mass on a spring does not depend in any way on how it has been started, how far down we pull it."
3845,"The period is determined, but the amplitude of the oscillation is not determined by the equation of motion (21.2)."
3846,"The amplitude is determined, in fact, by how we let go of it, by what we call the initial conditions or starting conditions."
3847,"Actually, we have not quite found the most general possible solution of Eq."
3848,(21.2).
3849,There are other solutions.
3850,Such a motion is not represented by a cosine—it is represented by a sine.
3851,This also corresponds to shifting the origin of time to some new instant.
3852,That is determined by the differential equation.
3853,"The other constants are not determined by the equation, but by how the motion is started."
3854,Let us put it differently.
3855,The fact that cosines are involved in the solution of Eq.
3856,(21.2) suggests that there might be some relationship to circles.
3857,"This is artificial, of course, because there is no circle actually involved in the linear motion—it just goes up and down."
3858,"We may point out that we have, in fact, already solved that differential equation when we were studying the mechanics of circular motion."
3859,"We have already worked that out geometrically; it is the magnitude of the acceleration times the cosine of the projection angle, with a minus sign because it is toward the center."
3860,"As a check on this, one can devise an experiment to show that the up-and-down motion of a mass on a spring is the same as that of a point going around in a circle."
3861,In Fig.
3862,"21–3 an arc light projected on a screen casts shadows of a crank pin on a shaft and of a vertically oscillating mass, side by side."
3863,"If we let go of the mass at the right time from the right place, and if the shaft speed is carefully adjusted so that the frequencies match, each should follow the other exactly."
3864,"One can also check the numerical solution we obtained earlier with the cosine function, and see whether that agrees very well."
3865,"Here we may point out that because uniform motion in a circle is so closely related mathematically to oscillatory up-and-down motion, we can analyze oscillatory motion in a simpler way if we imagine it to be a projection of something going in a circle."
3866,"If we do this, we will be able to analyze our one-dimensional oscillator with circular motions, which is a lot easier than having to solve a differential equation."
3867,"The trick in doing this is to use complex numbers, a procedure we shall introduce in the next chapter."
3868,Of course these are determined by how we start the motion.
3869,"If we start the motion with just a small displacement, that is one type of oscillation; if we start with an initial displacement and then push up when we let go, we get still a different motion."
3870,These are called the initial conditions.
3871,We would like to connect the initial conditions with the constants.
3872,"Although this can be done using any one of the forms (21.6), it turns out to be easiest if we use Eq."
3873,(21.6c).
3874,This is the most general way we can start the motion.
3875,"That is the end of our solution, but there is one physically interesting thing to check, and that is the conservation of energy."
3876,"Since there are no frictional losses, energy ought to be conserved."
3877,This variation of the kinetic energy is just the opposite of that of the potential energy.
3878,But the total energy ought to be a constant.
3879,"The average potential energy is half the maximum and, therefore, half the total, and the average kinetic energy is likewise half the total energy."
3880,"Next we shall discuss the forced harmonic oscillator, i.e., one in which there is an external driving force acting."
3881,So we try to solve Eq.
3882,(21.8) with the special force (21.9).
3883,What is the solution of (21.8)?
3884,"In other words, we might suppose that if we kept pushing back and forth, the mass would follow back and forth in step with the force."
3885,We can try it anyway.
3886,"At very high frequency the denominator may become very large, and there is then not much amplitude."
3887,"Of course the solution we have found is the solution only if things are started just right, for otherwise there is a part which usually dies out after a while."
3888,"So if we adjust the frequency of the force to be “in time” with the natural frequency, then we should get an enormous displacement."
3889,This is well known to anybody who has pushed a child on a swing.
3890,It does not work very well to close our eyes and push at a certain speed at random.
3891,"If we happen to get the right timing, then the swing goes very high, but if we have the wrong timing, then sometimes we may be pushing when we should be pulling, and so on, and it does not work."
3892,"The reason it does not is that something goes wrong with the equation, there are some other frictional terms, and other forces, which are not in (21.8) but which occur in the real world."
3893,So the amplitude does not reach infinity for some reason; it may be that the spring breaks!
3894,"In our study of oscillating systems we shall have occasion to use one of the most remarkable, almost astounding, formulas in all of mathematics."
3895,"From the physicist’s point of view we could bring forth this formula in two minutes or so, and be done with it."
3896,"But science is as much for intellectual enjoyment as for practical utility, so instead of just spending a few minutes on this amazing jewel, we shall surround the jewel by its proper setting in the grand design of that branch of mathematics which is called elementary algebra."
3897,"Now you may ask, “What is mathematics doing in a physics lecture?” We have several possible excuses: first, of course, mathematics is an important tool, but that would only excuse us for giving the formula in two minutes."
3898,"On the other hand, in theoretical physics we discover that all our laws can be written in mathematical form; and that this has a certain simplicity and beauty about it."
3899,"So, ultimately, in order to understand nature it may be necessary to have a deeper understanding of mathematical relationships."
3900,"But the real reason is that the subject is enjoyable, and although we humans cut nature up in different ways, and we have different courses in different departments, such compartmentalization is really artificial, and we should take our intellectual pleasures where we find them."
3901,"Another reason for looking more carefully at algebra now, even though most of us studied algebra in high school, is that that was the first time we studied it; all the equations were unfamiliar, and it was hard work, just as physics is now."
3902,"Every so often it is a great pleasure to look back to see what territory has been covered, and what the great map or plan of the whole thing is."
3903,Perhaps some day somebody in the Mathematics Department will present a lecture on mechanics in such a way as to show what it was we were trying to learn in the physics course!
3904,"The subject of algebra will not be developed from the point of view of a mathematician, exactly, because the mathematicians are mainly interested in how various mathematical facts are demonstrated, and how many assumptions are absolutely required, and what is not required."
3905,They are not so interested in the result of what they prove.
3906,"For example, we may find the Pythagorean theorem quite interesting, that the sum of the squares of the sides of a right triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse; that is an interesting fact, a curiously simple thing, which may be appreciated without discussing the question of how to prove it, or what axioms are required."
3907,"So, in the same spirit, we shall describe qualitatively, if we may put it that way, the system of elementary algebra."
3908,To discuss this subject we start in the middle.
3909,"We suppose that we already know what integers are, what zero is, and what it means to increase a number by one unit."
3910,"You may say, “That is not in the middle!” But it is the middle from a mathematical standpoint, because we could go even further back and describe the theory of sets in order to derive some of these properties of integers."
3911,"But we are not going in that direction, the direction of mathematical philosophy and mathematical logic, but rather in the other direction, from the assumption that we know what integers are and we know how to count."
3912,"In this discussion we must also assume a few other properties like continuity and ordering, which are very hard to define; we will let the rigorous theory do it."
3913,"Furthermore, it is definitely true that we have written down too many “rules”; some of them may be deducible from the others, but we shall not worry about such matters."
3914,"In addition to the direct operations of addition, multiplication, and raising to a power, we have also the inverse operations, which are defined as follows."
3915,"The fact that it has a cumbersome notation relative to the others does not mean that it is any less elementary, at least applied to integers, than the other processes."
3916,"Although logarithms come late in an algebra class, in practice they are, of course, just as simple as roots; they are just a different kind of solution of an algebraic equation."
3917,Now here is the idea.
3918,"These relationships, or rules, are correct for integers, since they follow from the definitions of addition, multiplication, and raising to a power."
3919,"When we try to solve simple algebraic equations using all these definitions, we soon discover some insoluble problems, such as the following."
3920,"And of course there is no such number, because we consider only positive integers; this is an insoluble problem."
3921,"However, the plan, the great idea, is this: abstraction and generalization."
3922,"From the whole structure of algebra, rules plus integers, we abstract the original definitions of addition and multiplication, but we leave the rules (22.1) and (22.2), and assume these to be true in general on a wider class of numbers, even though they are originally derived on a smaller class."
3923,"Thus, rather than using integers symbolically to define the rules, we use the rules as the definition of the symbols, which then represent a more general kind of number."
3924,"So we have increased the range of objects over which the rules work, but the meaning of the symbols is different."
3925,That means nothing.
3926,But nevertheless everything will work out all right according to the rules.
3927,An interesting problem comes up in taking powers.
3928,Onward!
3929,The great plan is to continue the process of generalization; whenever we find another problem that we cannot solve we extend our realm of numbers.
3930,"But if we suppose that all fractional numbers also satisfy the rules, then we can talk about multiplying and adding fractions, and everything works as well as it did before."
3931,"In this way, then, we can define what we mean by putting fractions in the various symbols, by using the rules themselves to help us determine the definition—it is not arbitrary."
3932,"It is a remarkable fact that all the rules still work for positive and negative integers, as well as for fractions!"
3933,We go on in the process of generalization.
3934,Are there any other equations we cannot solve?
3935,"Yes, there are."
3936,It is very easy for us in modern days to answer this question.
3937,"Historically, this idea presented great difficulty to the Greeks."
3938,"To really define precisely what is meant here requires that we add some substance of continuity and ordering, and it is, in fact, quite the most difficult step in the processes of generalization just at this point."
3939,"It was made, formally and rigorously, by Dedekind."
3940,"However, without worrying about the mathematical rigor of the thing, it is quite easy to understand that what we mean is that we are going to find a whole sequence of approximate fractions, perfect fractions (because any decimal, when stopped somewhere, is of course rational), which just keeps on going, getting closer and closer to the desired result."
3941,The next problem comes with what happens with the irrational powers.
3942,"In principle, the answer is simple enough."
3943,"Then we may run it up a few more decimal places (it is again rational), take the appropriate root, this time a much higher root because there is a much bigger denominator in the fraction, and get a better approximation."
3944,"Of course we are going to get some enormously high roots involved here, and the work is quite difficult."
3945,How can we cope with this problem?
3946,"In the computations of square roots, cube roots, and other small roots, there is an arithmetical process available by which we can get one decimal place after another."
3947,But the amount of labor needed to calculate irrational powers and the logarithms that go with them (the inverse problem) is so great that there is no simple arithmetical process we can use.
3948,"Therefore tables have been built up which permit us to calculate these powers, and these are called the tables of logarithms, or the tables of powers, depending on which way the table is set up."
3949,"It is merely a question of saving time; if we must raise some number to an irrational power, we can look it up rather than having to compute it."
3950,"Of course, such a computation is just a technical problem, but it is an interesting one, and of great historical value."
3951,"This is not a problem where we have to define a new kind of number for the result, it is merely a computational problem."
3952,"The answer is simply an irrational number, an unending decimal, not a new kind of a number."
3953,Let us now discuss the problem of calculating solutions of such equations.
3954,The general idea is really very simple.
3955,"It makes no difference what base is used; we can use the same principle all the time, and if we are using logarithms to any particular base, we can find logarithms to any other base merely by a change in scale, a multiplying factor."
3956,If we multiply Eq.
3957,"(The question may arise as to whether there is any natural base, any base in which things are somehow simpler, and we shall try to find an answer to that later."
3958,Now let us see how to calculate logarithms.
3959,The results are shown in Table 22–1.
3960,What good is that?
3961,But we must do a little bit better than that; we clearly need more information.
3962,Why don’t we keep on going for more and more accuracy?
3963,Because we begin to notice something.
3964,This ought to correct all the excesses to the same value.
3965,We see that they are very closely equal.
3966,"At the top of the table they are not equal, but as they come down, they get closer and closer to a constant value."
3967,What is the value?
3968,"These changes are obviously half of each other, very closely, as we go down."
3969,"Let us now actually calculate a logarithm, because the process we shall use is where logarithm tables actually come from."
3970,"The procedure is shown in Table 22–2, and the numerical values are shown in Table 22–1 (columns 2 and 3)."
3971,No; that is too big.
3972,"This is how logarithms were originally computed by Mr. Briggs of Halifax, in 1620."
3973,"He made tables of logarithms to fourteen decimal places by this method, which is quite tedious."
3974,But all logarithm tables for three hundred years were borrowed from Mr. Briggs’ tables by reducing the number of decimal places.
3975,"Only in modern times, with the WPA and computing machines, have new tables been independently computed."
3976,"There are much more efficient methods of computing logarithms today, using certain series expansions."
3977,(1.001643) = 2.7184.
3978,(1.001643)= 2.7184.
3979,"The use of such tables, then, is the way in which irrational powers and the logarithms of irrational numbers are all calculated."
3980,That takes care of the irrationals.
3981,Now it turns out that after all that work we still cannot solve every equation!
3982,So we again have to generalize our numbers to a still wider class.
3983,This is called taking the complex conjugate.
3984,Therefore all the numbers that now belong in the rules (22.1) have this mathematical form.
3985,"Now you say, “This can go on forever!"
3986,"This is a fantastic fact, which we must leave to the Mathematics Department to prove."
3987,"The proofs are very beautiful and very interesting, but certainly not self-evident."
3988,"In fact, the most obvious supposition is that we are going to have to invent again and again and again."
3989,But the greatest miracle of all is that we do not.
3990,This is the last invention.
3991,"After this invention of complex numbers, we find that the rules still work with complex numbers, and we are finished inventing new things."
3992,"We can find the complex power of any complex number, we can solve any equation that is written algebraically, in terms of a finite number of those symbols."
3993,We do not find any new numbers.
3994,We will discuss that now.
3995,Now we can add and multiply complex numbers.
3996,"But the real problem, of course, is to compute complex powers of complex numbers."
3997,It turns out that the problem is actually no more difficult than computing complex powers of real numbers.
3998,"Of course, we must at all times use our rules (22.1) and (22.2)."
3999,What guide is there?
4000,It is done as follows.
4001,We shall look into that a little bit more in a moment.
4002,Which of the numbers in Table 22–3 do we have to multiply together to get a pure imaginary result?
4003,Then we discover that we should multiply this by a number whose imaginary part is about equal to the size of the real part we are trying to remove.
4004,How do we do that?
4005,In Fig.
4006,"22–1 the dots represent the numbers that appear in Table 22–4, and the lines are just drawn to help you visually."
4007,"In other words, it has a period, it repeats."
4008,"Of course, we recognize what the curves look like!"
4009,"They look like the sine and cosine, and we shall call them, for a while, the algebraic sine and algebraic cosine."
4010,Is the period the same?
4011,Let us find out.
4012,"So we have created two new functions in a purely algebraic manner, the cosine and the sine, which belong to algebra, and only to algebra."
4013,We wake up at the end to discover the very functions that are natural to geometry.
4014,"So there is a connection, ultimately, between algebra and geometry."
4015,22–2).
4016,"This, then, is the unification of algebra and geometry."
4017,"When we began this chapter, armed only with the basic notions of integers and counting, we had little idea of the power of the processes of abstraction and generalization."
4018,"Using the set of algebraic “laws,” or properties of numbers, Eq."
4019,"(22.1), and the definitions of inverse operations (22.2), we have been able here, ourselves, to manufacture not only numbers but useful things like tables of logarithms, powers, and trigonometric functions (for these are what the imaginary powers of real numbers are), all merely by extracting ten successive square roots of ten!"
4020,"In the present chapter we shall continue our discussion of the harmonic oscillator and, in particular, the forced harmonic oscillator, using a new technique in the analysis."
4021,"In the preceding chapter we introduced the idea of complex numbers, which have real and imaginary parts and which can be represented on a diagram in which the ordinate represents the imaginary part and the abscissa represents the real part."
4022,Referring to Fig.
4023,We are going to apply complex numbers to our analysis of physical phenomena by the following trick.
4024,The reason we do this is that it is easier to work with an exponential function than with a cosine.
4025,So the whole trick is to represent our oscillatory functions as the real parts of certain complex functions.
4026,Let us take another example.
4027,Thus we see that the algebra of exponentials is much easier than that of sines and cosines; this is the reason we choose to use complex numbers.
4028,"Now let us solve an equation, using complex numbers, to see whether we can work out a problem for some real case."
4029,"Let us now try our new method for the problem of the forced oscillator, that we already know how to solve."
4030,We want to solve Eq.
4031,So we try to solve (23.3) for the forced solution; we shall discuss other solutions later.
4032,"When we differentiate an exponential function, we bring down the exponent as a simple multiplier."
4033,(Differentiation is now as easy as multiplication!
4034,"This idea of using exponentials in linear differential equations is almost as great as the invention of logarithms, in which multiplication is replaced by addition."
4035,Here differentiation is replaced by multiplication.)
4036,See how simple it is!
4037,"That, then, is how we analyze oscillatory motion with the more elegant mathematical technique."
4038,But the elegance of the technique is not at all exhibited in such a problem that can be solved easily by other methods.
4039,It is only exhibited when one applies it to more difficult problems.
4040,"Let us therefore solve another, more difficult problem, which furthermore adds a relatively realistic feature to the previous one."
4041,"Actually, of course, no such infinite response occurs because some other things, like friction, which we have so far ignored, limits the response."
4042,Let us therefore add to Eq.
4043,(23.2) a friction term.
4044,Ordinarily such a problem is very difficult because of the character and complexity of the frictional term.
4045,"There are, however, many circumstances in which the frictional force is proportional to the speed with which the object moves."
4046,An example of such friction is the friction for slow motion of an object in oil or a thick liquid.
4047,"There is no force when it is just standing still, but the faster it moves the faster the oil has to go past the object, and the greater is the resistance."
4048,Now we have the equation in the most convenient form to solve.
4049,How do we solve this new linear differential equation?
4050,(23.6a).
4051,"(23.6a) by our old straightforward way, we would really appreciate the magic of the “complex” method.]"
4052,"Next, Eq."
4053,The phase shift varies as shown in Fig.
4054,23–3.
4055,"In certain circumstances we get a slightly different formula than (23.8), also called a “resonance” formula, and one might think that it represents a different phenomenon, but it does not."
4056,The resonance is sharper and sharper as the frictional effects are made smaller and smaller.
4057,"The importance of the resonance phenomenon is that it occurs in many other circumstances, and so the rest of this chapter will describe some of these other circumstances."
4058,The simplest and broadest technical applications of resonance are in electricity.
4059,In the electrical world there are a number of objects which can be connected to make electric circuits.
4060,"These passive circuit elements, as they are often called, are of three main types, although each one has a little bit of the other two mixed in."
4061,"Before describing them in greater detail, let us note that the whole idea of our mechanical oscillator being a mass on the end of a spring is only an approximation."
4062,All the mass is not actually at the “mass”; some of the mass is in the inertia of the spring.
4063,"Similarly, all of the spring is not at the “spring”; the mass itself has a little elasticity, and although it may appear so, it is not absolutely rigid, and as it goes up and down, it flexes ever so slightly under the action of the spring pulling it."
4064,The same thing is true in electricity.
4065,"There is an approximation in which we can lump things into “circuit elements” which are assumed to have pure, ideal characteristics."
4066,"It is not the proper time to discuss that approximation here, we shall simply assume that it is true in the circumstances."
4067,The three main kinds of circuit elements are the following.
4068,The first is called a capacitor (Fig.
4069,23–4); an example is two plane metallic plates spaced a very small distance apart by an insulating material.
4070,"When the plates are charged there is a certain voltage difference, that is, a certain difference in potential, between them."
4071,Note that the potential difference is a linear function of the charge.
4072,"If we do not have parallel plates, but insulated electrodes which are of any other shape, the difference in potential is still precisely proportional to the charge, but the constant of proportionality may not be so easy to compute."
4073,The second kind of circuit element is called a resistor; it offers resistance to the flow of electrical current.
4074,This relationship may already be familiar to you; it is Ohm’s law.
4075,(23.6).
4076,Now it is very interesting that there exists another circuit element which is the analog of mass!
4077,This is a coil which builds up a magnetic field within itself when there is a current in it.
4078,Suppose we make a circuit in which we have connected the three circuit elements in series (Fig.
4079,Thus Eq.
4080,"It is exactly the same denominator as we had in the mechanical case, with exactly the same resonance properties!"
4081,The correspondence between the electrical and mechanical cases is outlined in Table 23–1.
4082,We must mention a small technical point.
4083,"In the electrical literature, a different notation is used."
4084,"(From one field to another, the subject is not really any different, but the way of writing the notations is often different.)"
4085,(23.19).
4086,"Now they have become more educated and have ac circuits, so they want the equation to look the same."
4087,"The difficulties of science are to a large extent the difficulties of notations, the units, and all the other artificialities which are invented by man, not by nature.)"
4088,"Although we have discussed the electrical case in detail, we could also bring up case after case in many fields, and show exactly how the resonance equation is the same."
4089,There are many circumstances in nature in which something is “oscillating” and in which the resonance phenomenon occurs.
4090,We said that in an earlier chapter; let us now demonstrate it.
4091,"If we walk around our study, pulling books off the shelves and simply looking through them to find an example of a curve that corresponds to Fig."
4092,"23–2 and comes from the same equation, what do we find?"
4093,"Just to demonstrate the wide range obtained by taking the smallest possible sample, it takes only five or six books to produce quite a series of phenomena which show resonances."
4094,"The first two are from mechanics, the first on a large scale: the atmosphere of the whole earth."
4095,"If the atmosphere, which we suppose surrounds the earth evenly on all sides, is pulled to one side by the moon or, rather, squashed prolate into a double tide, and if we could then let it go, it would go sloshing up and down; it is an oscillator."
4096,The expected response of the atmosphere is shown in Fig.
4097,This is an example of very poor science.
4098,"From two numbers we obtain two numbers, and from those two numbers we draw a beautiful curve, which of course goes through the very point that determined the curve!"
4099,"It is of no use unless we can measure something else, and in the case of geophysics that is often very difficult."
4100,"Now there was such a sharp disturbance in 1883; the Krakatoa volcano exploded and half the island blew off, and it made such a terrific explosion in the atmosphere that the period of oscillation of the atmosphere could be measured."
4101,Next we go to the small scale of mechanical oscillation.
4102,"This time we take a sodium chloride crystal, which has sodium ions and chlorine ions next to each other, as we described in an early chapter."
4103,"These ions are electrically charged, alternately plus and minus."
4104,Now there is an interesting oscillation possible.
4105,"Suppose that we could drive all the plus charges to the right and all the negative charges to the left, and let go; they would then oscillate back and forth, the sodium lattice against the chlorine lattice."
4106,How can we ever drive such a thing?
4107,"That is easy, for if we apply an electric field on the crystal, it will push the plus charge one way and the minus charge the other way!"
4108,"So, by having an external electric field we can perhaps get the crystal to oscillate."
4109,"The frequency of the electric field needed is so high, however, that it corresponds to infrared radiation!"
4110,So we try to find a resonance curve by measuring the absorption of infrared light by sodium chloride.
4111,Such a curve is shown in Fig.
4112,23–7.
4113,"The abscissa is not frequency, but is given in terms of wavelength, but that is just a technical matter, of course, since for a wave there is a definite relation between frequency and wavelength; so it is really a frequency scale, and a certain frequency corresponds to the resonant frequency."
4114,But what about the width?
4115,What determines the width?
4116,There are two reasons why there can be a wider curve than the theoretical curve.
4117,"If the objects do not all have the same frequency, as might happen if the crystal were strained in certain regions, so that in those regions the oscillation frequency were slightly different than in other regions, then what we have is many resonance curves on top of each other; so we apparently get a wider curve."
4118,"Offhand, we cannot say whether the width in Fig."
4119,"23–7 is natural, or whether it is due to inhomogeneities in the crystal or the finite width of the slit of the spectrometer."
4120,"Now we turn to a more esoteric example, and that is the swinging of a magnet."
4121,"If we have a magnet, with north and south poles, in a constant magnetic field, the N end of the magnet will be pulled one way and the S end the other way, and there will in general be a torque on it, so it will vibrate about its equilibrium position, like a compass needle."
4122,"However, the magnets we are talking about are atoms."
4123,"These atoms have an angular momentum, the torque does not produce a simple motion in the direction of the field, but instead, of course, a precession."
4124,"Now, looked at from the side, any one component is “swinging,” and we can disturb or drive that swinging and measure an absorption."
4125,The curve in Fig.
4126,23–8 represents a typical such resonance curve.
4127,What has been done here is slightly different technically.
4128,"The frequency of the lateral field that is used to drive this swinging is always kept the same, while we would have expected that the investigators would vary that and plot the curve."
4129,Now we go still further.
4130,Our next example has to do with atomic nuclei.
4131,"The motions of protons and neutrons in nuclei are oscillatory in certain ways, and we can demonstrate this by the following experiment."
4132,We note in Fig.
4133,"23–9, however, one difference from other cases: the horizontal scale is not a frequency, it is an energy!"
4134,The reason is that in quantum mechanics what we think of classically as the energy will turn out to be really related to a frequency of a wave amplitude.
4135,"When we analyze something which in simple large-scale physics has to do with a frequency, we find that when we do quantum-mechanical experiments with atomic matter, we get the corresponding curve as a function of energy."
4136,"In fact, this curve is a demonstration of this relationship, in a sense."
4137,"It shows that frequency and energy have some deep interrelationship, which of course they do."
4138,"Now we turn to another example which also involves a nuclear energy level, but now a much, much narrower one."
4139,"It was measured by Dr. Mössbauer, and it was the basis of his Nobel prize."
4140,"The horizontal scale here is velocity, because the technique for obtaining the slightly different frequencies was to use the Doppler effect, by moving the source relative to the absorber."
4141,One can see how delicate the experiment is when we realize that the speed involved is a few centimeters per second!
4142,"Finally, if we look in an issue of the Physical Review, say that of January 1, 1962, will we find a resonance curve?"
4143,"Every issue has a resonance curve, and Fig."
4144,23–11 is the resonance curve for this one.
4145,This resonance curve turns out to be very interesting.
4146,"The resonance is detected by seeing how many of some kinds of particles come out, and depending on what and how many come out, one gets different curves, but of the same shape and with the peak at the same energy."
4147,"This is a new particle, or resonance."
4148,Today we do not know whether to call a bump like this a “particle” or simply a resonance.
4149,"When there is a very sharp resonance, it corresponds to a very definite energy, just as though there were a particle of that energy present in nature."
4150,"When the resonance gets wider, then we do not know whether to say there is a particle which does not last very long, or simply a resonance in the reaction probability."
4151,"In the second chapter, this point is made about the particles, but when the second chapter was written this resonance was not known, so our chart should now have still another particle in it!"
4152,"Although this chapter is entitled “transients,” certain parts of it are, in a way, part of the last chapter on forced oscillation."
4153,One of the features of a forced oscillation which we have not yet discussed is the energy in the oscillation.
4154,Let us now consider that energy.
4155,"In a mechanical oscillator, how much kinetic energy is there?"
4156,It is proportional to the square of the velocity.
4157,Now we come to an important point.
4158,So when we wish to find the energy we have to get away from the complex notation for a while to see what the inner workings are.
4159,"The square of the quantity, then, goes up and down from a maximum to zero, like the square of the cosine."
4160,We shall use this theorem several times.
4161,Now let us consider the energy in a forced oscillator.
4162,"The work done by the force per second, i.e., the power, is the force times the velocity."
4163,"That is to say, the term in brackets is a pure derivative of two terms that are easy to understand—one is the kinetic energy of motion, and the other is the potential energy of the spring."
4164,"Let us call this quantity the stored energy, that is, the energy stored in the oscillation."
4165,Suppose that we want the average power over many cycles when the oscillator is being forced and has been running for a long time.
4166,"In the long run, the stored energy does not change—its derivative gives zero average effect."
4167,"There is some energy stored in the oscillation, but that does not change with time, if we average over many cycles."
4168,Another interesting feature to discuss is how much energy is stored.
4169,"That is not the same as the power, because although power was at first used to store up some energy, after that the system keeps on absorbing power, insofar as there are any heating (resistive) losses."
4170,"The force does a great deal of work in getting the oscillation going, but then to keep it steady, all it has to do is to fight the friction."
4171,"The oscillator can have a great deal of energy if the friction is very low, and even though it is oscillating strongly, not much energy is being lost."
4172,"The efficiency of an oscillator can be measured by how much energy is stored, compared with how much work the force does per oscillation."
4173,How does the stored energy compare with the amount of work that is done in one cycle?
4174,"When it is relatively large, it gives a measure of how good the oscillator is."
4175,The most generally accepted definition is Eq.
4176,We now turn to our main topic of discussion: transients.
4177,"By a transient is meant a solution of the differential equation when there is no force present, but when the system is not simply at rest."
4178,"(Of course, if it is standing still at the origin with no force acting, that is a nice problem—it stays there!)"
4179,"Suppose the oscillation starts another way: say it was driven by a force for a while, and then we turn off the force."
4180,What happens then?
4181,"So long as a force is acting, the stored energy stays the same, and there is a certain amount of work done to maintain it."
4182,"Now suppose we turn off the force, and no more work is being done; then the losses which are eating up the energy of the supply are no longer eating up its energy—there is no more driver."
4183,"The losses will have to consume, so to speak, the energy that is stored."
4184,What is the frequency?
4185,"Let us suppose that the system moves so nicely, with hardly any force, that if we let go it will oscillate at essentially the same frequency all by itself."
4186,Then we deduce from Eq.
4187,"What would the formula be, roughly, for the amplitude of the oscillation as a function of the time?"
4188,The same?
4189,No!
4190,"The amount of energy in a spring, say, goes as the square of the displacement; the kinetic energy goes as the square of the velocity; so the total energy goes as the square of the displacement."
4191,"Thus the displacement, the amplitude of oscillation, will decrease half as fast because of the square."
4192,24–1 give us an idea of what we should expect; now let us try to analyze the motion precisely by solving the differential equation of the motion itself.
4193,"So, starting with Eq."
4194,"(24.1), with no outside force, how do we solve it?"
4195,"Being physicists, we do not have to worry about the method as much as we do about what the solution is."
4196,(Why do we try this?
4197,It is the easiest thing to differentiate!)
4198,So it is really quite simple to substitute.
4199,The only bothersome thing is that we get two solutions!
4200,"Second, the amplitude of the oscillation is decreasing exponentially!"
4201,"This is the only error, so it is the same thing—we have the right idea."
4202,But everything is not all right!
4203,What is not all right is that there is another solution.
4204,"What is the extra one for, because of course we know we should only take the real part?"
4205,"We know that we must take the real part, but how did the mathematics know that we only wanted the real part?"
4206,"The physical world has a real solution, but the answer that we were so happy with before is not real, it is complex."
4207,Now let us see if the above really works.
4208,We construct the electrical circuit shown in Fig.
4209,"It is an oscillatory circuit, and it generates a transient of some kind."
4210,It corresponds to a circumstance in which we suddenly apply a force and the system starts to oscillate.
4211,"It is the electrical analog of a damped mechanical oscillator, and we watch the oscillation on an oscilloscope, where we should see the curves that we were trying to analyze."
4212,"(The horizontal motion of the oscilloscope is driven at a uniform speed, while the vertical motion is the voltage across the inductor."
4213,The rest of the circuit is only a technical detail.
4214,"We would like to repeat the experiment many, many times, since the persistence of vision is not good enough to see only one trace on the screen."
4215,In Figs.
4216,"24–3 to 24–6 we see examples of damped oscillations, actually photographed on an oscilloscope  screen."
4217,It does not die out very fast; it oscillates many times on the way down.
4218,"When we increase the resistance in the circuit, it dies out faster (Fig."
4219,24–4).
4220,"Then if we increase the resistance in the circuit still more, it dies out faster still (Fig."
4221,24–5).
4222,"But when we put in more than a certain amount, we cannot see any oscillation at all!"
4223,"The question is, is this because our eyes are not good enough?"
4224,"If we increase the resistance still more, we get a curve like that of Fig."
4225,"24–6, which does not appear to have any oscillations, except perhaps one."
4226,"Now, how can we explain that by mathematics?"
4227,Thank goodness!
4228,Why?
4229,"In putting more and more resistance into the circuit, we know it is not going to explode—quite the contrary."
4230,"So now we have two solutions, each one by itself a dying exponential, but one having a much faster “dying rate” than the other."
4231,The general solution is of course a combination of the two; the coefficients in the combination depending upon how the motion starts—what the initial conditions of the problem are.
4232,This is the mathematical expression for the way an oscillation dies out.
4233,"We shall not make direct use of it, but there are a number of points we should like to emphasize that are true in more general cases."
4234,This is a good solution to try in such circumstances.
4235,In this chapter we shall discuss certain aspects of oscillating systems that are found somewhat more generally than just in the particular systems we have been discussing.
4236,This is easy to prove.
4237,"We sometimes call this an operator notation, but it makes no difference what we call it, it is just “shorthand.”"
4238,"If they are, we call such a problem a linear problem."
4239,"In this chapter we shall discuss some of the properties that exist because the system is linear, to appreciate the generality of some of the results that we have obtained in our special analysis of a special equation."
4240,"Now let us study some of the properties of linear differential equations, having illustrated them already with the specific equation (25.1) that we have studied so closely."
4241,"The first property of interest is this: suppose that we have to solve the differential equation for a transient, the free oscillation with no driving force."
4242,"In other words, if we had a motion of a certain “size,” then a motion twice as “big” is again a solution."
4243,Why?
4244,So if we have found a number of solutions for the motion of a linear system we can add them together.
4245,"If we happen to be able to find three solutions, then we find that any combination of the three solutions is again a solution, and so on."
4246,It turns out that the number of what we call independent solutions1 that we have obtained for our oscillator problem is only two.
4247,The number of independent solutions that one finds in the general case depends upon what is called the number of degrees of freedom.
4248,"We shall not discuss this in detail now, but if we have a second-order differential equation, there are only two independent solutions, and we have found both of them; so we have the most general solution."
4249,"Now let us go on to another proposition, which applies to the situation in which the system is subjected to an outside force."
4250,The free solution is called a transient solution.
4251,"When we have no force acting, and suddenly turn one on, we do not immediately get the steady solution that we solved for with the sine wave solution, but for a while there is a transient which sooner or later dies out, if we wait long enough."
4252,"The “forced” solution does not die out, since it keeps on being driven by the force."
4253,"Ultimately, for long periods of time, the solution is unique, but initially the motions are different for different circumstances, depending on how the system was started."
4254,Now we come to another interesting proposition.
4255,"This is an example of what is called the principle of superposition for linear systems, and it is very important."
4256,"It means the following: if we have a complicated force which can be broken up in any convenient manner into a sum of separate pieces, each of which is in some way simple, in the sense that for each special piece into which we have divided the force we can solve the equation, then the answer is available for the whole force, because we may simply add the pieces of the solution back together, in the same manner as the total force is compounded out of pieces (Fig."
4257,25–1).
4258,Let us give another example of the principle of superposition.
4259,"In other words, if we know the field due to a certain charge, then the field due to many charges is merely the vector sum of the fields of these charges taken individually."
4260,"This is exactly analogous to the above proposition that if we know the result of two given forces taken at one time, then if the force is considered as a sum of them, the response is a sum of the corresponding individual responses."
4261,"The reason why this is true in electricity is that the great laws of electricity, Maxwell’s equations, which determine the electric field, turn out to be differential equations which are linear, i.e., which have the property (25.3)."
4262,"What corresponds to the force is the charge generating the electric field, and the equation which determines the electric field in terms of the charge is linear."
4263,"As another interesting example of this proposition, let us ask how it is possible to “tune in” to a particular radio station at the same time as all the radio stations are broadcasting."
4264,"The radio station transmits, fundamentally, an oscillating electric field of very high frequency which acts on our radio antenna."
4265,"It is true that the amplitude of the oscillation of the field is changed, modulated, to carry the signal of the voice, but that is very slow, and we are not going to worry about it."
4266,We certainly do not hear both stations at the same time.
4267,It therefore looks as though we will never disentangle them.
4268,"In fact, the very proposition of superposition seems to insist that we cannot avoid having both of them in our system."
4269,25–3.
4270,"Now suppose that the two stations are comparable in strength, that is, the two forces are of the same magnitude."
4271,"But, in Fig."
4272,Now what about the tuning?
4273,How do we tune it?
4274,"In particular, most radios are built so that one can change the capacitance."
4275,"That is how radio tuning works; it is again the principle of superposition, combined with a resonant response.2"
4276,"To conclude this discussion, let us describe qualitatively what happens if we proceed further in analyzing a linear problem with a given force, when the force is quite complicated."
4277,"Out of the many possible procedures, there are two especially useful general ways that we can solve the problem."
4278,"One is this: suppose that we can solve it for special known forces, such as sine waves of different frequencies."
4279,We know it is child’s play to solve it for sine waves.
4280,So we have the so-called “child’s play” cases.
4281,Now the question is whether our very complicated force can be represented as the sum of two or more “child’s play” forces.
4282,In Fig.
4283,"25–1 we already had a fairly complicated curve, and of course we can make it more complicated still if we add in more sine waves."
4284,So it is certainly possible to obtain very complicated curves.
4285,"And, in fact, the reverse is also true: practically every curve can be obtained by adding together infinite numbers of sine waves of different wavelengths (or frequencies) for each one of which we know the answer."
4286,This method of solution is called the method of Fourier transforms or Fourier analysis.
4287,We are not going to actually carry out such an analysis just now; we only wish to describe the idea involved.
4288,Another way in which our complicated problem can be solved is the following very interesting one.
4289,"Suppose that, by some tremendous mental effort, it were possible to solve our problem for a special force, namely an impulse."
4290,The force is quickly turned on and then off; it is all over.
4291,"Actually we need only solve for an impulse of some unit strength, any other strength can be gotten by multiplication by an appropriate factor."
4292,"Now what can we say about some other force, for instance a force like that of Fig."
4293,25–4?
4294,Such a force can be likened to a succession of blows with a hammer.
4295,"First there is no force, and all of a sudden there is a steady force—impulse, impulse, impulse, impulse, … and then it stops."
4296,"In other words, we imagine the continuous force to be a series of impulses, very close together."
4297,"Now, we know the result for an impulse, so the result for a whole series of impulses will be a whole series of damped oscillations: it will be the curve for the first impulse, and then (slightly later) we add to that the curve for the second impulse, and the curve for the third impulse, and so on."
4298,"Thus we can represent, mathematically, the complete solution for arbitrary functions if we know the answer for an impulse."
4299,We get the answer for any other force simply by integrating.
4300,This method is called the Green’s function method.
4301,"A Green’s function is a response to an impulse, and the method of analyzing any force by putting together the response of impulses is called the Green’s function method."
4302,"The physical principles involved in both of these schemes are so simple, involving just the linear equation, that they can be readily understood, but the mathematical problems that are involved, the complicated integrations and so on, are a little too advanced for us to attack right now."
4303,You will most likely return to this some day when you have had more practice in mathematics.
4304,But the idea is very simple indeed.
4305,"Finally, we make some remarks on why linear systems are so important."
4306,The answer is simple: because we can solve them!
4307,So most of the time we solve linear problems.
4308,"Second (and most important), it turns out that the fundamental laws of physics are often linear."
4309,"The Maxwell equations for the laws of electricity are linear, for example."
4310,"The great laws of quantum mechanics turn out, so far as we know, to be linear equations."
4311,"That is why we spend so much time on linear equations: because if we understand linear equations, we are ready, in principle, to understand a lot of things."
4312,We mention another situation where linear equations are found.
4313,"When displacements are small, many functions can be approximated linearly."
4314,"A nonlinear equation cannot be solved, ordinarily, any other way but numerically."
4315,It turns out that there are many circumstances where small effects are linear: for the example here the swing of a pendulum through small arcs.
4316,"As another example, if we pull a little bit on a spring, the force is proportional to the extension."
4317,"If we pull hard, we break the spring, and the force is a completely different function of the distance!"
4318,Linear equations are important.
4319,In fact they are so important that perhaps fifty percent of the time we are solving linear equations in physics and in engineering.
4320,Let us now review the things we have been talking about in the past few chapters.
4321,It is very easy for the physics of oscillators to become obscured by the mathematics.
4322,"The physics is actually very simple, and if we may forget the mathematics for a moment we shall see that we can understand almost everything that happens in an oscillating system."
4323,"First, if we have only the spring and the weight, it is easy to understand why the system oscillates—it is a consequence of inertia."
4324,"We pull the mass down and the force pulls it back up; as it passes zero, which is the place it likes to be, it cannot just suddenly stop; because of its momentum it keeps on going and swings to the other side, and back and forth."
4325,"So, if there were no friction, we would surely expect an oscillatory motion, and indeed we get one."
4326,"But if there is even a little bit of friction, then on the return cycle, the swing will not be quite as high as it was the first time."
4327,"Now what happens, cycle by cycle?"
4328,That depends on the kind and amount of friction.
4329,"Suppose that we could concoct a kind of friction force that always remains in the same proportion to the other forces, of inertia and in the spring, as the amplitude of oscillation varies."
4330,"In other words, for smaller oscillations the friction should be weaker than for big oscillations."
4331,"Ordinary friction does not have this property, so a special kind of friction must be carefully invented for the very purpose of creating a friction that is directly proportional to the velocity—so that for big oscillations it is stronger and for small oscillations it is weaker."
4332,"If we happen to have that kind of friction, then at the end of each successive cycle the system is in the same condition as it was at the start, except a little bit smaller."
4333,"All the forces are smaller in the same proportion: the spring force is reduced, the inertial effects are lower because the accelerations are now weaker, and the friction is less too, by our careful design."
4334,"When we actually have that kind of friction, we find that each oscillation is exactly the same as the first one, except reduced in amplitude."
4335,An exponential function is a curve which does just that.
4336,It changes by the same factor in each equal interval of time.
4337,It is very simple.
4338,"What happens if the friction is not so artificial; for example, ordinary rubbing on a table, so that the friction force is a certain constant amount, and is independent of the size of the oscillation that reverses its direction each half-cycle?"
4339,"Then the equation is no longer linear, it becomes hard to solve, and must be solved by the numerical method given in Chapter 9, or by considering each half-cycle separately."
4340,"The numerical method is the most powerful method of all, and can solve any equation."
4341,It is only when we have a simple problem that we can use mathematical analysis.
4342,Mathematical analysis is not the grand thing it is said to be; it solves only the simplest possible equations.
4343,"As soon as the equations get a little more complicated, just a shade—they cannot be solved analytically."
4344,"But the numerical method, which was advertised at the beginning of the course, can take care of any equation of physical interest."
4345,"Next, what about the resonance curve?"
4346,Why is there a resonance?
4347,"First, imagine for a moment that there is no friction, and we have something which could oscillate by itself."
4348,"If we tapped the pendulum just right each time it went by, of course we could make it go like mad."
4349,"But if we close our eyes and do not watch it, and tap at arbitrary equal intervals, what is going to happen?"
4350,Sometimes we will find ourselves tapping when it is going the wrong way.
4351,"When we happen to have the timing just right, of course, each tap is given at just the right time, and so it goes higher and higher and higher."
4352,So without friction we get a curve which looks like the solid curve in Fig.
4353,25–5 for different frequencies.
4354,"Qualitatively, we understand the resonance curve; in order to get the exact shape of the curve it is probably just as well to do the mathematics."
4355,"Now suppose there is a little bit of friction; then when the displacement of the oscillator is small, the friction does not affect it much; the resonance curve is the same, except when we are near resonance."
4356,"Instead of becoming infinite near resonance, the curve is only going to get so high that the work done by our tapping each time is enough to compensate for the loss of energy by friction during the cycle."
4357,So the top of the curve is rounded off—it does not go to infinity.
4358,"If there is more friction, the top of the curve is rounded off still more."
4359,"Now someone might say, “I thought the widths of the curves depended on the friction.” That is because the curve is usually plotted so that the top of the curve is called one unit."
4360,"However, the mathematical expression is even simpler to understand if we just plot all the curves on the same scale; then all that happens is that the friction cuts down the top!"
4361,"If there is less friction, we can go farther up into that little pinnacle before the friction cuts it off, so it looks relatively narrow."
4362,"That is, the higher the peak of the curve, the narrower the width at half the maximum height."
4363,"Finally, we take the case where there is an enormous amount of friction."
4364,"It turns out that if there is too much friction, the system does not oscillate at all."
4365,"The energy in the spring is barely able to move it against the frictional force, and so it slowly oozes down to the equilibrium point."
4366,The next aspect of this review is to note that masses and springs are not the only linear systems; there are others.
4367,"In particular, there are electrical systems called linear circuits, in which we find a complete analog to mechanical systems."
4368,We did not learn exactly why each of the objects in an electrical circuit works in the way it does—that is not to be understood at the present moment; we may assert it as an experimentally verifiable fact that they behave as stated.
4369,"For example, let us take the simplest possible circumstance."
4370,"The higher the voltage difference, the more work was done when the charge, as we say, “falls” from the high potential end of the terminal to the low potential end."
4371,So charges release energy in going from one end to the other.
4372,The unit of resistance is the ohm; it is equal to one volt per ampere.
4373,"In mechanical situations, to get such a frictional force in proportion to the velocity is difficult; in an electrical system it is very easy, and this law is extremely accurate for most metals."
4374,"We are often interested in how much work is done per second, the power loss, or the energy liberated by the charges as they tumble down the wire."
4375,"This is called the heating loss—this is how much heat is generated in the resistance per second, by the conservation of energy."
4376,It is this heat that makes an ordinary incandescent light bulb work.
4377,"Of course, there are other interesting properties of mechanical systems, such as the mass (inertia), and it turns out that there is an electrical analog to inertia also."
4378,"It is possible to make something called an inductor, having a property called inductance, such that a current, once started through the inductance, does not want to stop."
4379,It requires a voltage in order to change the current!
4380,"If the current is constant, there is no voltage across an inductance."
4381,dc circuits do not know anything about inductance; it is only when we change the current that the effects of inductance show up.
4382,"All of the consequent equations for the two kinds of systems will have the same derivations because, in all the equations, we can change any letter to its corresponding analog letter and we get the same equation; everything we deduce will have a correspondence in the two systems."
4383,"Now what electrical thing corresponds to the mechanical spring, in which there was a force proportional to the stretch?"
4384,"It turns out that there is such a thing, in fact it is the only one of the three circuit elements we can really understand, because we did study a pair of parallel plates, and we found that if there were a charge of certain equal, opposite amounts on each plate, the electric field between them would be proportional to the size of the charge."
4385,So the work done in moving a unit charge across the gap from one plate to the other is precisely proportional to the charge.
4386,"This work is the definition of the voltage difference, and it is the line integral of the electric field from one plate to another."
4387,Every consequence is the same; so much the same that there is a brilliant thing we can do.
4388,"Suppose we have a mechanical system which is quite complicated, not just one mass on a spring, but several masses on several springs, all hooked together."
4389,What do we do?
4390,Solve it?
4391,"Perhaps; but look, we can make an electrical circuit which will have the same equations as the thing we are trying to analyze!"
4392,"So if we have a complicated thing with a whole lot of interconnecting elements, we can interconnect a whole lot of resistances, inductances, and capacitances, to imitate the mechanically complicated system."
4393,What is the advantage to that?
4394,"One problem is just as hard (or as easy) as the other, because they are exactly equivalent."
4395,The advantage is not that it is any easier to solve the mathematical equations after we discover that we have an electrical circuit (although that is the method used by electrical engineers!
4396,"), but instead, the real reason for looking at the analog is that it is easier to make the electrical circuit, and to change something in the system."
4397,"Suppose we have designed an automobile, and want to know how much it is going to shake when it goes over a certain kind of bumpy road."
4398,"We build an electrical circuit with inductances to represent the inertia of the wheels, spring constants as capacitances to represent the springs of the wheels, and resistors to represent the shock absorbers, and so on for the other parts of the automobile."
4399,Then we need a bumpy road.
4400,"All right, we apply a voltage from a generator, which represents such and such a kind of bump, and then look at how the left wheel jiggles by measuring the charge on some capacitor."
4401,"Having measured it (it is easy to do), we find that it is bumping too much."
4402,"Do we need more shock absorber, or less shock absorber?"
4403,"With a complicated thing like an automobile, do we actually change the shock absorber, and solve it all over again?"
4404,"No!, we simply turn a dial; dial number ten is shock absorber number three, so we put in more shock absorber."
4405,"The bumps are worse—all right, we try less."
4406,This is called an analog computer.
4407,"It is a device which imitates the problem that we want to solve by making another problem, which has the same equation, but in another circumstance of nature, and which is easier to build, to measure, to adjust, and to destroy!"
4408,"Finally, there is an important item which is not quite in the nature of review."
4409,This has to do with an electrical circuit in which there is more than one circuit element.
4410,"For example, when we have an inductor, a resistor, and a capacitor connected as in Fig."
4411,"24–2, we note that all the charge went through every one of the three, so that the current in such a singly connected thing is the same at all points along the wire."
4412,"So, the total voltage drop is the sum of these, and this leads to Eq."
4413,(25.15).
4414,"Using complex numbers, we found that we could solve the equation for the steady-state motion in response to a sinusoidal force."
4415,25–6a) and apply a voltage.
4416,What happens?
4417,The same current goes through both.
4418,This is not the only way things may be connected.
4419,"We may also connect them in another way, called a parallel connection (Fig."
4420,25–6b).
4421,"Now we see that a given voltage across the terminals, if the connecting wires are perfect conductors, is effectively applied to both of the impedances, and will cause currents in each independently."
4422,It is the same voltage.
4423,"More complicated circuits can sometimes be simplified by taking pieces of them, working out the succession of impedances of the pieces, and combining the circuit together step by step, using the above rules."
4424,"That is, all the current which comes in must come back out."
4425,"(2) If we carry a charge around any loop, and back to where it started, the net work done is zero."
4426,These rules are called Kirchhoff’s laws for electrical circuits.
4427,Their systematic application to complicated circuits often simplifies the analysis of such circuits.
4428,We mention them here in conjunction with Eqs.
4429,"(25.16) and (25.17), in case you have already come across such circuits that you need to analyze in laboratory work."
4430,They will be discussed again in more detail next year.
4431,This is the first of a number of chapters on the subject of electromagnetic radiation.
4432,"Light, with which we see, is only one small part of a vast spectrum of the same kind of thing, the various parts of this spectrum being distinguished by different values of a certain quantity which varies."
4433,"This variable quantity could be called the “wavelength.” As it varies in the visible spectrum, the light apparently changes color from red to violet."
4434,"If we explore the spectrum systematically, from long wavelengths toward shorter ones, we would begin with what are usually called radiowaves."
4435,"Then there are the so-called “short waves,” i.e., radar waves, millimeter waves, and so on."
4436,"There are no actual boundaries between one range of wavelengths and another, because nature did not present us with sharp edges."
4437,"The number associated with a given name for the waves are only approximate and, of course, so are the names we give to the different ranges."
4438,"Then, a long way down through the millimeter waves, we come to what we call the infrared, and thence to the visible spectrum."
4439,"Then going in the other direction, we get into a region which is called the ultraviolet."
4440,"Within this vast range of wavelengths, there are three or more regions of approximation which are especially interesting."
4441,"In one of these, a condition exists in which the wavelengths involved are very small compared with the dimensions of the equipment available for their study; furthermore, the photon energies, using the quantum theory, are small compared with the energy sensitivity of the equipment."
4442,Under these conditions we can make a rough first approximation by a method called geometrical optics.
4443,"If, on the other hand, the wavelengths are comparable to the dimensions of the equipment, which is difficult to arrange with visible light but easier with radiowaves, and if the photon energies are still negligibly small, then a very useful approximation can be made by studying the behavior of the waves, still disregarding the quantum mechanics."
4444,"This method is based on the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, which will be discussed in a later chapter."
4445,"Next, if we go to very short wavelengths, where we can disregard the wave character but the photons have a very large energy compared with the sensitivity of our equipment, things get simple again."
4446,"This is the simple photon picture, which we will describe only very roughly."
4447,"The complete picture, which unifies the whole thing into one model, will not be available to us for a long time."
4448,"In this chapter our discussion is limited to the geometrical optics region, in which we forget about the wavelength and the photon character of the light, which will all be explained in due time."
4449,"We do not even bother to say what the light is, but just find out how it behaves on a large scale compared with the dimensions of interest."
4450,All this must be said in order to emphasize the fact that what we are going to talk about is only a very crude approximation; this is one of the chapters that we shall have to “unlearn” again.
4451,"But we shall very quickly unlearn it, because we shall almost immediately go on to a more accurate method."
4452,"Although geometrical optics is just an approximation, it is of very great importance technically and of great interest historically."
4453,We shall present this subject more historically than some of the others in order to give some idea of the development of a physical theory or physical idea.
4454,"First, light is, of course, familiar to everybody, and has been familiar since time immemorial."
4455,"Now one problem is, by what process do we see light?"
4456,"There have been many theories, but it finally settled down to one, which is that there is something which enters the eye—which bounces off objects into the eye."
4457,"We have heard that idea so long that we accept it, and it is almost impossible for us to realize that very intelligent men have proposed contrary theories—that something comes out of the eye and feels for the object, for example."
4458,"Some other important observations are that, as light goes from one place to another, it goes in straight     lines, if there is nothing in the way, and that the rays do not seem to interfere with one another."
4459,"That is, light is crisscrossing in all directions in the room, but the light that is passing across our line of vision does not affect the light that comes to us from some object."
4460,This was once a most powerful argument against the corpuscular theory; it was used by Huygens.
4461,"If light were like a lot of arrows shooting along, how could other arrows go through them so easily?"
4462,Such philosophical arguments are not of much weight.
4463,One could always say that light is made up of arrows which go through each other!
4464,The discussion above gives enough of the basic idea of geometrical optics—now we have to go a little further into the quantitative features.
4465,Thus far we have light going only in straight lines between two points; now let us study the behavior of light when it hits various materials.
4466,"The simplest object is a mirror, and the law for a mirror is that when the light hits the mirror, it does not continue in a straight line, but bounces off the mirror into a new straight line, which changes when we change the inclination of the mirror."
4467,"The question for the ancients was, what is the relation between the two angles involved?"
4468,"This is a very simple relation, discovered long ago."
4469,"The light striking a mirror travels in such a way that the two angles, between each beam and the mirror, are equal."
4470,For some reason it is customary to measure the angles from the normal to the mirror surface.
4471,"That is a simple enough proposition, but a more difficult problem is encountered when light goes from one medium into another, for example from air into water; here also, we see that it does not go in a straight line."
4472,"But if we tilt the beam of light at quite an angle, then the deviation angle is very large."
4473,"The question is, what is the relation of one angle to the other?"
4474,"This also puzzled the ancients for a long time, and here they never found the answer!"
4475,"It is, however, one of the few places in all of Greek physics that one may find any experimental results listed."
4476,Claudius Ptolemy made a list of the angle in water for each of a number of different angles in air.
4477,"Table 26–1 shows the angles in the air, in degrees, and the corresponding angle as measured in the water."
4478,(Ordinarily it is said that Greek scientists never did any experiments.
4479,"But it would be impossible to obtain this table of values without knowing the right law, except by experiment."
4480,"It should be noted, however, that these do not represent independent careful measurements for each angle but only some numbers interpolated from a few measurements, for they all fit perfectly on a parabola.)"
4481,"This, then, is one of the important steps in the development of physical law: first we observe an effect, then we measure it and list it in a table; then we try to find the rule by which one thing can be connected with another."
4482,"The above numerical table was made in 140 a.d., but it was not until 1621 that someone finally found the rule connecting the two angles!"
4483,Equation (26.2) is called Snell’s     law; it permits us to predict how the light is going to bend when it goes from air into water.
4484,Table 26–2 shows the angles in air and in water according to Snell’s law.
4485,Note the remarkable agreement with Ptolemy’s list.
4486,"Now in the further development of science, we want more than just a formula."
4487,"First we have an observation, then we have numbers that we measure, then we have a law which summarizes all the numbers."
4488,But the real glory of science is that we can find a way of     thinking such that the law is evident.
4489,"The first way of thinking that made the law about the behavior of light evident was discovered by Fermat in about 1650, and it is called the principle of least     time, or Fermat’s principle."
4490,"His idea is this: that out of all possible paths that it might take to get from one point to another, light takes the path which requires the shortest time."
4491,"Let us first show that this is true for the case of the mirror, that this simple principle contains both the law of straight-line propagation and the law for the mirror."
4492,"So, we are growing in our understanding!"
4493,Let us try to find the solution to the following problem.
4494,In Fig.
4495,"But if we add the extra rule that the light has to strike the mirror and come back in the shortest time, the answer is not so easy."
4496,We can find it very nicely by a geometrical trick.
4497,"Therefore the problem becomes, when is the sum of these two lengths the least?"
4498,"In other words, we have to find the point where we go toward the artificial point, and that will be the correct one."
4499,"Originally, the statement was made by Hero of Alexandria that the light travels in such a way that it goes to the mirror and to the other point in the shortest possible distance, so it is not a modern theory."
4500,It was this that inspired Fermat to suggest to himself that perhaps refraction operated on a similar basis.
4501,"But for refraction, light obviously does not use the path of shortest distance, so Fermat tried the idea that it takes the shortest time."
4502,"Before we go on to analyze refraction, we should make one more remark about the mirror."
4503,"So the illusion that there is an object behind the mirror is merely due to the fact that the light which is entering the eye is entering in exactly the same manner, physically, as it would have entered had there been an object back there (except for the dirt on the mirror, and our knowledge of the existence of the mirror, and so on, which is corrected in the brain)."
4504,Now let us demonstrate that the principle of least time will give Snell’s law of refraction.
4505,"We must, however, make an assumption about the speed of light in water."
4506,In Fig.
4507,But we can run faster than we can swim.
4508,What do we do?
4509,Do we go in a straight line?
4510,"(Yes, no doubt!)"
4511,"However, by using a little more intelligence we would realize that it would be advantageous to travel a little greater distance on land in order to decrease the distance in the water, because we go so much slower in the water."
4512,"(Following this line of reasoning out, we would say the right thing to do is to compute very carefully what should be done!)"
4513,"If it is the shortest path, that means that if we take any other, it will be longer."
4514,"So our way of finding the law will be to consider that we move the place by a very small amount, and to demand that there be essentially no change in time."
4515,It is very easy to do.
4516,"First, look at the path on land."
4517,Let us say we gain by not having to go that extra distance.
4518,"Those times must be equal since, in the first approximation, there is to be no change in time."
4519,Now let us consider some of the interesting consequences of the principle of least time.
4520,First is the principle of reciprocity.
4521,"An example of interest is a glass block with plane parallel faces, set at an angle to a light beam."
4522,"26–6) does not go through in a straight line, but instead it decreases the time in the block by making the angle in the block less inclined, although it loses a little bit in the air."
4523,The beam is simply displaced parallel to itself because the angles in and out are the same.
4524,"A third interesting phenomenon is the fact that when we see the sun setting, it is already below the horizon!"
4525,"It does not look as though it is below the horizon, but it is (Fig."
4526,26–7).
4527,The earth’s atmosphere is thin at the top and dense at the bottom.
4528,"When it appears to go below the horizon, it is actually already well below the horizon."
4529,Another example of this phenomenon is the mirage that one often sees while driving on hot roads.
4530,"One sees “water” on the road, but when he gets there, it is as dry as the desert!"
4531,The phenomenon is the following.
4532,"What we are really seeing is the sky light “reflected” on the road: light from the sky, heading for the road, can end up in the eye, as shown in Fig."
4533,26–8.
4534,Why?
4535,The air is very hot just above the road but it is cooler up higher.
4536,"Hotter air is more expanded than cooler air and is thinner, and this decreases the speed of light less."
4537,"That is to say, light goes faster in the hot region than in the cool region."
4538,"Therefore, instead of the light deciding to come in the straightforward way, it also has a least-time path by which it goes into the region where it goes faster for awhile, in order to save time."
4539,"So, it can go in a curve."
4540,26–9).
4541,That is all right.
4542,We want to bring all the light back to what we call a focus.
4543,How?
4544,"If the light always takes the path of least time, then certainly it should not want to go over all these other paths."
4545,The only way that the light can be perfectly satisfied to take several adjacent paths is to make those times exactly equal!
4546,"Otherwise, it would select the one of least time."
4547,Therefore the problem of making a focusing system is merely to arrange a device so that it takes the same time for the light to go on all the different paths!
4548,This is easy to do.
4549,Suppose that we had a piece of glass in which light goes slower than it does in the air (Fig.
4550,26–10).
4551,But if we were to insert a piece of glass of just the right thickness (we shall later figure out how thick) it might exactly compensate the excess time that it would take the light to go at an angle!
4552,We end up with a piece of glass that looks like Fig.
4553,26–10.
4554,"This, of course, is well known to us, and we call such a device a converging lens."
4555,In the next chapter we shall actually calculate what shape the lens has to have to make a perfect focus.
4556,26–11).
4557,"On any path, it goes to some mirror and comes back, and all times must be equal."
4558,"Here the light always travels in air, so the time and the distance are proportional."
4559,Therefore the statement that all the times are the same is the same as the statement that the total distance is the same.
4560,An ellipse is that curve which has the property that the sum of the distances from two points is a constant for every point on the ellipse; thus we can be sure that the light from one focus will come to the other.
4561,The same principle works for gathering the light of a star.
4562,Imagine a star billions of miles away; we would like to cause all the light that comes in to come to a focus.
4563,"Of course we cannot draw the rays that go all the way up to the star, but we still want to check whether the times are equal."
4564,26–12).
4565,Thus our curve is the locus of all points equidistant from a line and a point.
4566,Such a curve is called a parabola; the mirror is made in the shape of a parabola.
4567,The above examples illustrate the principle upon which such optical devices can be designed.
4568,"The exact curves can be calculated using the principle that, to focus perfectly, the travel times must be exactly equal for all light rays, as well as being less than for any other nearby path."
4569,We shall discuss these focusing optical devices further in the next chapter; let us now discuss the further development of the theory.
4570,"When a new theoretical principle is developed, such as the principle of least time, our first inclination might be to say, “Well, that is very pretty; it is delightful; but the question is, does it help at all in understanding the physics?” Someone may say, “Yes, look at how many things we can now understand!” Another says, “Very well, but I can understand mirrors, too."
4571,I need a curve such that every tangent plane makes equal angles with the two rays.
4572,"I can figure out a lens, too, because every ray that comes to it is bent through an angle given by Snell’s law.” Evidently the statement of least time and the statement that angles are equal on reflection, and that the sines of the angles are proportional on refraction, are the same."
4573,"So is it merely a philosophical question, or one of beauty?"
4574,There can be arguments on both sides.
4575,"However, the importance of a powerful principle is that it     predicts new things."
4576,It is easy to show that there are a number of new things predicted by Fermat’s principle.
4577,"On the other hand, according to the idea of least time, there is a definite relationship."
4578,"), then our formula is easy."
4579,"The relation (26.5) was known very early, and was a very strong argument for the principle of least time."
4580,"Another argument for the principle of least time, another prediction, is that if we measure the speed of light in water, it will be lower than in air."
4581,This is a prediction of a completely different type.
4582,"It is a brilliant prediction, because all we have so far measured are angles; here we have a theoretical prediction which is quite different from the observations from which Fermat deduced the idea of least time."
4583,"It turns out, in fact, that the speed in water is slower than the speed in air, by just the proportion that is needed to get the right index!"
4584,"Actually, we must make the statement of the principle of least time a little more accurately."
4585,It was not stated correctly above.
4586,"It is incorrectly called the principle of least time and we have gone along with the incorrect description for convenience, but we must now see what the correct statement is."
4587,Suppose we had a mirror as in Fig.
4588,26–3.
4589,What makes the light think it has to go to the mirror?
4590,"So some people might say, “Sometimes it is a maximum time.” It is not a maximum time, because certainly a curved path would take a still longer time!"
4591,"The correct statement is the following: a ray going in a certain particular path has the property that if we make a small change (say a one percent shift) in the ray in any manner whatever, say in the location at which it comes to the mirror, or the shape of the curve, or anything, there will be no first-order change in the time; there will be only a second-order change in the time."
4592,"In other words, the principle is that light takes a path such that there are many other paths nearby which take almost exactly the same time."
4593,"The following is another difficulty with the principle of least time, and one which people who do not like this kind of a theory could never stomach."
4594,With Snell’s theory we can “understand” light.
4595,"Light goes along, it sees a surface, it bends because it does something at the surface."
4596,"The idea of causality, that it goes from one point to another, and another, and so on, is easy to understand."
4597,But the principle of least time is a completely different philosophical principle about the way nature works.
4598,"Instead of saying it is a causal thing, that when we do one thing, something else happens, and so on, it says this: we set up the situation, and light decides which is the shortest time, or the extreme one, and chooses that path."
4599,"But what does it do, how does it find out?"
4600,"Does it smell the nearby paths, and check them against each other?"
4601,"The answer is, yes, it does, in a way."
4602,"That is the feature which is, of course, not known in geometrical optics, and which is involved in the idea of wavelength; the wavelength tells us approximately how far away the light must “smell” the path in order to check it."
4603,"It is hard to demonstrate this fact on a large scale with light, because the wavelengths are so terribly short."
4604,"If we have a source of radiowaves, a detector, and a slit, as in Fig."
4605,"One can do the same thing with light, but it is hard to demonstrate on a large scale."
4606,The effect can be seen under the following simple conditions.
4607,"Find a small, bright light, say an unfrosted bulb in a street light far away or the reflection of the sun in a curved automobile bumper."
4608,"Then put two fingers in front of one eye, so as to look through the crack, and squeeze the light to zero very gently."
4609,"You will see that the image of the light, which was a little dot before, becomes quite elongated, and even stretches into a long line."
4610,"The reason is that the fingers are very close together, and the light which is supposed to come in a straight line is spread out at an angle, so that when it comes into the eye it comes in from several directions."
4611,"Also you will notice, if you are very careful, side maxima, a lot of fringes along the edges too."
4612,"Furthermore, the whole thing is colored."
4613,"All of this will be explained in due time, but for the present it is a demonstration that light does not always go in straight lines, and it is one that is very easily performed."
4614,"Finally, we give a very crude view of what actually happens, how the whole thing really works, from what we now believe is the correct, quantum-dynamically accurate viewpoint, but of course only qualitatively described."
4615,"26–3, we find that the light does not seem to be in the form of waves at all."
4616,"Instead the rays seem to be made up of photons, and they actually produce clicks in a photon counter, if we are using one."
4617,The law for that chance is the following very strange one.
4618,The number of turns per second is the frequency of the light.
4619,"Now take another path; it has, for instance, a different time, so the vector for it is turned through a different angle—the angle being always proportional to the time."
4620,"Take all the available paths and add on a little vector for each one; then the answer is that the chance of arrival of the photon is proportional to the square of the length of the final vector, from the beginning to the end!"
4621,Now let us show how this implies the principle of least time for a mirror.
4622,26–3.
4623,26–14).
4624,"Eventually, we have quite a tight knot."
4625,"The total probability is the distance from one end to the other, squared."
4626,Almost all of that accumulated probability occurs in the region     where all the arrows are in the same direction (or in the same phase).
4627,"All the contributions from the paths which have very different times as we change the path, cancel themselves out by pointing in different directions."
4628,"That is why, if we hide the extreme parts of the mirror, it still reflects almost exactly the same, because all we did was to take out a piece of the diagram inside the spiral ends, and that makes only a very small change in the light."
4629,"So this is the relationship between the ultimate picture of photons with a probability of arrival depending on an accumulation of arrows, and the principle of least time."
4630,"In this chapter we shall discuss some elementary applications of the ideas of the previous chapter to a number of practical devices, using the approximation called geometrical optics."
4631,This is a most useful approximation in the practical design of many optical systems and instruments.
4632,Geometrical optics is either very simple or else it is very complicated.
4633,"By that we mean that we can either study it only superficially, so that we can design instruments roughly, using rules that are so simple that we hardly need deal with them here at all, since they are practically of high school level, or else, if we want to know about the small errors in lenses and similar details, the subject gets so complicated that it is too advanced to discuss here!"
4634,"If one has an actual, detailed problem in lens design, including analysis of aberrations, then he is advised to read about the subject or else simply to trace the rays through the various surfaces (which is what the book tells how to do), using the law of refraction from one side to the other, and to find out where they come out and see if they form a satisfactory image."
4635,"People have said that this is too tedious, but today, with computing machines, it is the right way to do it."
4636,One can set up the problem and make the calculation for one ray after another very easily.
4637,"So the subject is really ultimately quite simple, and involves no new principles."
4638,"Furthermore, it turns out that the rules of either elementary or advanced optics are seldom characteristic of other fields, so that there is no special reason to follow the subject very far, with one important exception."
4639,"The most advanced and abstract theory of geometrical optics was worked out by Hamilton, and it turns out that this has very important applications in mechanics."
4640,"It is actually even more important in mechanics than it is in optics, and so we leave Hamilton’s theory for the subject of advanced analytical mechanics, which is studied in the senior year or in graduate school."
4641,"So, appreciating that geometrical optics contributes very little, except for its own sake, we now go on to discuss the elementary properties of simple optical systems on the basis of the principles outlined in the last chapter."
4642,27–1).
4643,How much longer?
4644,One way is this.
4645,"The first and simplest situation to discuss is a single refracting surface, separating two media with different indices of refraction (Fig."
4646,27–2).
4647,"We leave the case of arbitrary indices of refraction to the student, because ideas are always the most important thing, not the specific situation, and the problem is easy enough to do in any case."
4648,This condition supplies us with an equation for determining the surface.
4649,"The answer is that the surface is a very complicated fourth-degree curve, and the student may entertain himself by trying to calculate it by analytic geometry."
4650,It is interesting to compare this curve with the parabolic curve we found for a focusing mirror when the light is coming from infinity.
4651,So the proper surface cannot easily be made—to focus the light from one point to another requires a rather complicated surface.
4652,"It turns out in practice that we do not try to make such complicated surfaces ordinarily, but instead we make a compromise."
4653,"The farther ones may deviate if they want to, unfortunately, because the ideal surface is complicated, and we use instead a spherical surface with the right curvature at the axis."
4654,"It is so much easier to fabricate a sphere than other surfaces that it is profitable for us to find out what happens to rays striking a spherical surface, supposing that only the rays near the axis are going to be focused perfectly."
4655,"Those rays which are near the axis are sometimes called paraxial rays, and what we are analyzing are the conditions for the focusing of paraxial rays."
4656,We shall discuss later the errors that are introduced by the fact that all rays are not always close to the axis.
4657,"Likewise, we could imagine it the other way."
4658,"Therefore, if we had a light source inside the glass, we might want to know where the focus is."
4659,"In particular, if the light in the glass were at infinity (same problem) where would it come to a focus outside?"
4660,"Of course, we can also put it the other way."
4661,We see an interesting thing: if we divide each focal length by the corresponding index of refraction we get the same result!
4662,"This theorem, in fact, is general."
4663,"It is true of any system of lenses, no matter how complicated, so it is interesting to remember."
4664,"We did not prove here that it is general—we merely noted it for a single surface, but it happens to be true in general that the two focal lengths of a system are related in this way."
4665,Sometimes Eq.
4666,What happens then?
4667,It does mean something very interesting and very definite.
4668,"It is still a useful formula, in other words, even when the numbers are negative."
4669,What it means is shown in Fig.
4670,27–3.
4671,"This is an apparent image, sometimes called a virtual image."
4672,27–2 is called a real image.
4673,"If the light really comes to a point, it is a real image."
4674,"But if the light appears to be coming from a point, a fictitious point different from the original point, it is a virtual image."
4675,"Likewise, we can use the same equation backwards, so that if we look into a plane surface at an object that is at a certain distance inside the dense medium, it will appear as though the light is coming from not as far back (Fig."
4676,27–4).
4677,"We could go on, of course, to discuss the spherical mirror."
4678,"But if one appreciates the ideas involved, he should be able to work it out for himself."
4679,"Therefore we leave it to the student to work out the formula for the spherical mirror, but we mention that it is well to adopt certain conventions concerning the distances involved:"
4680,In Fig.
4681,"Although the derivation of formula (27.3) is simple and elegant, using least time, one can of course work out the same formula using Snell’s law, remembering that the angles are so small that the sines of angles can be replaced by the angles themselves."
4682,"Now we go on to consider another situation, a very practical one."
4683,"Most of the lenses that we use have two surfaces, not just one."
4684,How does this affect matters?
4685,"Suppose that we have two surfaces of different curvature, with glass filling the space between them (Fig."
4686,27–5).
4687,How can we do that?
4688,"The answer is this: First, use formula (27.3) for the first surface, forgetting about the second surface."
4689,Now we consider a new problem.
4690,Where will they actually converge?
4691,We use the same formula again!
4692,"There are some rather high-class formulas that would save us considerable energy in the few times in our lives that we might have to chase the light through five surfaces, but it is easier just to chase it through five surfaces when the problem arises than it is to memorize a lot of formulas, because it may be we will never have to chase it through any surfaces at all!"
4693,"In any case, the principle is that when we go through one surface we find a new position, a new focal point, and then take that point as the starting point for the next surface, and so on."
4694,Particularly simple is the special case in which the two surfaces are very close together—so close that we may ignore small errors due to the thickness.
4695,If we draw the lens as shown in Fig.
4696,This time the focal lengths are equal.
4697,(This is another special case of the general rule that the ratio of the two focal lengths is the ratio of the indices of refraction in the two media in which the rays focus.
4698,"In this particular optical system, the initial and final indices are the same, so the two focal lengths are equal.)"
4699,"Forgetting for a moment about the actual formula for the focal length, if we bought a lens that somebody designed with certain radii of curvature and a certain index, we could measure the focal length, say, by seeing where a point at infinity focuses."
4700,Now let us see how the formula works and what it implies in different circumstances.
4701,Another interesting thing it says is that both points move in the same direction.
4702,"If one moves to the right, the other does also."
4703,So far we have discussed the focusing action only for points on the axis.
4704,"Now let us discuss also the imaging of objects not exactly on the axis, but a little bit off, so that we can understand the properties of magnification."
4705,"When we set up a lens so as to focus light from a small filament onto a “point” on a screen, we notice that on the screen we get a “picture” of the same filament, except of a larger or smaller size than the true filament."
4706,This must mean that the light comes to a focus from each point of the filament.
4707,"In order to understand this a little better, let us analyze the thin lens system shown schematically in Fig."
4708,27–7.
4709,We know the following facts:
4710,We need only use our ingenuity to find the exact direction of one other ray.
4711,But we remember that a parallel ray goes through the focus and vice versa: a ray which goes through the focus will come out parallel!
4712,"(It is true that the actual rays which are doing the focusing may be much more limited than the two we have drawn, but they are harder to figure, so we make believe that we can make this ray.)"
4713,This will determine the correct place and the correct height.
4714,Now we may derive a lens formula.
4715,(27.12).
4716,(27.12) is the same as Eq.
4717,(27.16).
4718,"Without actually deriving it, we shall briefly describe the general result when we have a number of lenses."
4719,"If we have a system of several lenses, how can we possibly analyze it?"
4720,That is easy.
4721,"We start with some object and calculate where its image is for the first lens, using formula (27.16) or (27.12) or any other equivalent formula, or by drawing diagrams."
4722,So we find an image.
4723,"Then we treat this image as the source for the next lens, and use the second lens with whatever its focal length is to again find an image."
4724,We simply chase the thing through the succession of lenses.
4725,That is all there is to it.
4726,"It involves nothing new in principle, so we shall not go into it."
4727,"However, there is a very interesting net result of the effects of any sequence of lenses on light that starts and ends up in the same medium, say air."
4728,"Any optical instrument—a telescope or a microscope with any number of lenses and mirrors—has the following property: There exist two planes, called the principal planes of the system (these planes are often fairly close to the first surface of the first lens and the last surface of the last lens), which have the following properties: (1) If light comes into the system parallel from the first side, it comes out at a certain focus, at a distance from the second principal plane equal to the focal length, just as though the system were a thin lens situated at this plane."
4729,(See Fig.
4730,27–8.)
4731,It so happens that for a thin lens the principal planes are coincident.
4732,"It is just as though we could take a thin lens, slice it down the middle, and separate it, and not notice that it was separated."
4733,Every ray that comes in pops out immediately on the other side of the second plane from the same point as it went into the first plane!
4734,"The principal planes and the focal length may be found either by experiment or by calculation, and then the whole set of properties of the optical system are described."
4735,"It is very interesting that the result is not complicated when we are all finished with such a big, complicated optical system."
4736,"Before we get too excited about how marvelous lenses are, we must hasten to add that there are also serious limitations, because of the fact that we have limited ourselves, strictly speaking, to paraxial rays, the rays near the axis."
4737,"A real lens having a finite size will, in general, exhibit aberrations."
4738,"For example, a ray that is on the axis, of course, goes through the focus; a ray that is very close to the axis will still come to the focus very well."
4739,"But as we go farther out, the ray begins to deviate from the focus, perhaps by falling short, and a ray striking near the top edge comes down and misses the focus by quite a wide margin."
4740,"So, instead of getting a point image, we get a smear."
4741,"This effect is called spherical aberration, because it is a property of the spherical surfaces we use in place of the right shape."
4742,"This could be remedied, for any specific object distance, by re-forming the shape of the lens surface, or perhaps by using several lenses arranged so that the aberrations of the individual lenses tend to cancel each other."
4743,"Lenses have another fault: light of different colors has different speeds, or different indices of refraction, in the glass, and therefore the focal length of a given lens is different for different colors."
4744,"So if we image a white spot, the image will have colors, because when we focus for the red, the blue is out of focus, or vice versa."
4745,This property is called chromatic aberration.
4746,There are still other faults.
4747,"If the object is off the axis, then the focus really isn’t perfect any more, when it gets far enough off the axis."
4748,The easiest way to verify this is to focus a lens and then tilt it so that the rays are coming in at a large angle from the axis.
4749,"Then the image that is formed will usually be quite crude, and there may be no place where it focuses well."
4750,There are thus several kinds of errors in lenses that the optical designer tries to remedy by using many lenses to compensate each other’s errors.
4751,How careful do we have to be to eliminate aberrations?
4752,Is it possible to make an absolutely perfect optical system?
4753,Suppose we had built an optical system that is supposed to bring light exactly to a point.
4754,"Now, arguing from the point of view of least time, can we find a condition on how perfect the system has to be?"
4755,The system will have some kind of an entrance opening for the light.
4756,"If we take the farthest ray from the axis that can come to the focus (if the system is perfect, of course), the times for all rays are exactly equal."
4757,"But nothing is perfect, so the question is, how wrong can the time be for this ray and not be worth correcting any further?"
4758,That depends on how perfect we want to make the image.
4759,But suppose we want to make the image as perfect as it possibly can be made.
4760,"Then, of course, our impression is that we have to arrange that every ray takes as nearly the same time as possible."
4761,"But it turns out that this is not true, that beyond a certain point we are trying to do something that is too fine, because the theory of geometrical optics does not work!"
4762,"Remember that the principle of least time is not an accurate formulation, unlike the principle of conservation of energy or the principle of conservation of momentum."
4763,"The principle of least time is only an approximation, and it is interesting to know how much error can be allowed and still not make any apparent difference."
4764,"The answer is that if we have arranged that between the maximal ray—the worst ray, the ray that is farthest out—and the central ray, the difference in time is less than about the period that corresponds to one oscillation of the light, then there is no use improving it any further."
4765,"Light is an oscillatory thing with a definite frequency that is related to the wavelength, and if we have arranged that the time difference for different rays is less than about a period, there is no use going any further."
4766,Another interesting question—a very important technical question with all optical instruments—is how much resolving power they have.
4767,"If we build a microscope, we want to see the objects that we are looking at."
4768,"That means, for instance, that if we are looking at a bacterium with a spot on each end, we want to see that there are two dots when we magnify them."
4769,"One might think that all we have to do is to get enough magnification—we can always add another lens, and we can always magnify again and again, and with the cleverness of designers, all the spherical aberrations and chromatic aberrations can be cancelled out, and there is no reason why we cannot keep on magnifying the image."
4770,To discover the rule that determines how far apart two points have to be so that at the image they appear as separate points can be stated in a very beautiful way associated with the time it takes for different rays.
4771,"(It is not true, because it is not a perfect system, but that is another problem.)"
4772,"In other words, whether we can make out the difference between them."
4773,"Of course, according to geometrical optics, there should be two point images, but what we see may be rather smeared and we may not be able to make out that there are two points."
4774,Why?
4775,"Because, if the times were equal, of course both would focus at the same point."
4776,So the times are not going to be equal.
4777,"But by how much do they have to differ so that we can say that both do not come to a common focus, so that we can distinguish the two image points?"
4778,"The general rule for the resolution of any optical instrument is this: two different point sources can be resolved only if one source is focused at such a point that the times for the maximal rays from the other source to reach that point, as compared with its own true image point, differ by more than one period."
4779,The smallest things that we can see are therefore approximately the wavelength of light.
4780,"A corresponding formula exists for telescopes, which tells us the smallest difference in angle between two stars that can just be distinguished.1"
4781,"The most dramatic moments in the development of physics are those in which great syntheses take place, where phenomena which previously had appeared to be different are suddenly discovered to be but different aspects of the same thing."
4782,"The history of physics is the history of such syntheses, and the basis of the success of physical science is mainly that we are able to synthesize."
4783,"Perhaps the most dramatic moment in the development of physics during the 19th century occurred to J. C. Maxwell one day in the 1860s, when he combined the laws of electricity and magnetism with the laws of the behavior of light."
4784,"As a result, the properties of light were partly unravelled—that old and subtle stuff that is so important and mysterious that it was felt necessary to arrange a special creation for it when writing Genesis."
4785,"Maxwell could say, when he was finished with his discovery, “Let there be electricity and magnetism, and there is light!”"
4786,For this culminating moment there was a long preparation in the gradual discovery and unfolding of the laws of electricity and magnetism.
4787,This story we shall reserve for detailed study next year.
4788,"However, the story is, briefly, as follows."
4789,"The gradually discovered properties of electricity and magnetism, of electric forces of attraction and repulsion, and of magnetic forces, showed that although these forces were rather complex, they all fell off inversely as the square of the distance."
4790,"We know, for example, that the simple Coulomb law for stationary charges is that the electric force field varies inversely as the square of the distance."
4791,"As a consequence, for sufficiently great distances there is very little influence of one system of charges on another."
4792,"Maxwell noted that the equations or the laws that had been discovered up to this time were mutually inconsistent when he tried to put them all together, and in order for the whole system to be consistent, he had to add another term to his equations."
4793,"With this new term there came an amazing prediction, which was that a part of the electric and magnetic fields would fall off much more slowly with the distance than the inverse square, namely, inversely as the first power of the distance!"
4794,"And so he realized that electric currents in one place can affect other charges far away, and he predicted the basic effects with which we are familiar today—radio transmission, radar, and so on."
4795,"It seems a miracle that someone talking in Europe can, with mere electrical influences, be heard thousands of miles away in Los Angeles."
4796,How is it possible?
4797,"It is because the fields do not vary as the inverse square, but only inversely as the first power of the distance."
4798,"Finally, then, even light itself was recognized to be electric and magnetic influences extending over vast distances, generated by an almost incredibly rapid oscillation of the electrons in the atoms."
4799,"All these phenomena we summarize by the word radiation or, more specifically, electromagnetic     radiation, there being one or two other kinds of radiation also."
4800,"Almost always, radiation means electromagnetic radiation."
4801,And thus is the universe knit together.
4802,"The atomic motions of a distant star still have sufficient influence at this great distance to set the electrons in our eye in motion, and so we know about the stars."
4803,"If this law did not exist, we would all be literally in the dark about the exterior world!"
4804,And the electric surgings in a galaxy five billion light years away—which is the farthest object we have found so far—can still influence in a significant and detectable way the currents in the great “dish” in front of a radio telescope.
4805,And so it is that we see the stars and the galaxies.
4806,This remarkable phenomenon is what we shall discuss in the present chapter.
4807,"At the beginning of this course in physics we outlined a broad picture of the world, but we are now better prepared to understand some aspects of it, and so we shall now go over some parts of it again in greater detail."
4808,We begin by describing the position of physics at the end of the 19th century.
4809,All that was then known about the fundamental laws can be summarized as follows.
4810,This is the principle of superposition.
4811,What is the formula for the electric and magnetic field produced by one individual charge?
4812,"It turns out that this is very complicated, and it takes a great deal of study and sophistication to appreciate it."
4813,But that is not the point.
4814,"We write down the law now only to impress the reader with the beauty of nature, so to speak, i.e., that it is possible to summarize all the fundamental knowledge on one page, with notations that he is now familiar with."
4815,"This law for the fields of an individual charge is complete and accurate, so far as we know (except for quantum mechanics) but it looks rather complicated."
4816,"We shall not study all the pieces now; we only write it down to give an impression, to show that it can be written, and so that we can see ahead of time roughly what it looks like."
4817,"As a matter of fact, the most useful way to write the correct laws of electricity and magnetism is not the way we shall now write them, but involves what are called field equations, which we shall learn about next year."
4818,"But the mathematical notations for these are different and new, and so we write the law in an inconvenient form for calculation, but in notations that we now know."
4819,"But, Coulomb’s law is wrong."
4820,"It is not correct that the first term is Coulomb’s law, not only because it is not possible to know where the charge is now and at what distance it is now, but also because the only thing that can affect the field at a given place and time is the behavior of the charges in the past."
4821,How far in the past?
4822,"That would be easy enough to understand, too, but it is also wrong."
4823,The whole thing is much more complicated.
4824,There are several more terms.
4825,"The next term is as though nature were trying to allow for the fact that the effect is retarded, if we might put it very crudely."
4826,"It suggests that we should calculate the delayed Coulomb field and add a correction to it, which is its rate of change times the time delay that we use."
4827,"Nature seems to be attempting to guess what the field at the present time is going to be, by taking the rate of change and multiplying by the time that is delayed."
4828,But we are not yet through.
4829,"Now the formula is finished, and that is all there is to the electric field from an arbitrarily moving charge."
4830,"We do not pretend to understand why it is possible to write so much in such a small space, but (28.3) and (28.4) contain the machinery by which electric generators work, how light operates, all the phenomena of electricity and magnetism."
4831,"Of course, to complete the story we also need to know something about the behavior of the materials involved—the properties of matter—which are not described properly by (28.3)."
4832,"To finish with our description of the world of the 19th century we must mention one other great synthesis which occurred in that century, one with which Maxwell had a great deal to do also, and that was the synthesis of the phenomena of heat and mechanics."
4833,We shall study that subject soon.
4834,"What had to be added in the 20th century was that the dynamical laws of Newton were found to be all wrong, and quantum mechanics had to be introduced to correct them."
4835,Newton’s laws are approximately valid when the scale of things is sufficiently large.
4836,"These quantum-mechanical laws, combined with the laws of electricity, have only recently been combined to form a set of laws called quantum     electrodynamics."
4837,"In addition, there were discovered a number of new phenomena, of which the first was radioactivity, discovered by Becquerel in 1896—he just sneaked it in under the 19th century."
4838,"This phenomenon of radioactivity was followed up to produce our knowledge of nuclei and new kinds of forces that are not gravitational and not electrical, but new particles with different interactions, a subject which has still not been unravelled."
4839,"For those purists who know more (the professors who happen to be reading this), we should add that when we say that (28.3) is a complete expression of the knowledge of electrodynamics, we are not being entirely accurate."
4840,There was a problem that was not quite solved at the end of the 19th century.
4841,"When we try to calculate the field from all the charges including the charge itself that we     want the field to act on, we get into trouble trying to find the distance, for example, of a charge from itself, and dividing something by that distance, which is zero."
4842,The problem of how to handle the part of this field which is generated by the very charge on which we want the field to act is not yet solved today.
4843,"So we leave it there; we do not have a complete solution to that puzzle yet, and so we shall avoid the puzzle for as long as we can."
4844,"That, then, is a summary of the world picture."
4845,Now let us use it to discuss the phenomena called radiation.
4846,"To discuss these phenomena, we must select from Eq."
4847,(28.3) only that piece which varies inversely as the distance and not as the square of the distance.
4848,"It turns out that when we finally do find that piece, it is so simple in its form that it is legitimate to study optics and electrodynamics in an elementary way by taking it as “the law” of the electric field produced by a moving charge far away."
4849,We shall take it temporarily as a given law which we will learn about in detail next year.
4850,"Of the terms appearing in (28.3), the first one evidently goes inversely as the square of the distance, and the second is only a correction for delay, so it is easy to show that both of them vary inversely as the square of the distance."
4851,"All of the effects we are interested in come from the third term, which is not very complicated, after all."
4852,What this term says is: look at the charge and note the direction of the unit vector (we can project the end of it onto the surface of a unit sphere).
4853,"As the charge moves around, the unit vector wiggles, and the acceleration of that unit vector is what we are     looking for."
4854,That is all.
4855,(The parts that go as the square have fallen off so much that we are not interested in them.)
4856,Now we can go a little bit further in studying (28.5) to see what it means.
4857,"Suppose a charge is moving in any manner whatsoever, and we are observing it from a distance."
4858,We imagine for a moment that in a sense it is “lit up” (although it is light that we are trying to explain); we imagine it as a little white dot.
4859,Then we would see this white dot running around.
4860,"But we don’t see exactly how it is running around right now, because of the delay that we have been talking about."
4861,What counts is how it was moving earlier.
4862,"One is the transverse piece, because the end of it goes up and down, and the other is a radial piece because it stays on a sphere."
4863,So for practical purposes all we have to do is project the motion on a plane at unit distance.
4864,Therefore we find the following rule: Imagine that we look at the moving charge and that everything we see is delayed—like a painter trying to paint a scene on a screen at a unit distance.
4865,"A real painter, of course, does not take into account the fact that light is going at a certain speed, but paints the world as he sees it."
4866,We want to see what his picture would look like.
4867,"So we see a dot, representing the charge, moving about in the picture."
4868,The acceleration of that dot is proportional to the electric field.
4869,That is all—all we need.
4870,Thus Eq.
4871,(28.5) is the complete and correct formula for radiation; even relativity effects are all contained in it.
4872,"However, we often want to apply it to a still simpler circumstance in which the charges are moving only a small distance at a relatively slow rate."
4873,"Since they are moving slowly, they do not move an appreciable distance from where they start, so that the delay time is practically constant."
4874,"Then the law is still simpler, because the delay time is fixed."
4875,Thus we imagine that the charge is executing a very tiny motion at an effectively constant distance.
4876,Let us see why that is.
4877,"Evidently, if the charge is moving in and out straight at us, the unit vector in that direction does not wiggle at all, and it has no acceleration."
4878,"So it is only the sidewise motion which is important, only the acceleration that we see projected on the screen."
4879,"In the remainder of this chapter we shall discuss this law so that we can understand it better physically, because we are going to use it to understand all of the phenomena of light and radio propagation, such as reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, and scattering."
4880,"It is the central law, and is all we need."
4881,All the rest of Eq.
4882,"(28.3) was written down only to set the stage, so that we could appreciate where (28.6) fits and how it comes about."
4883,We shall discuss (28.3) further next year.
4884,"In the meantime, we shall accept it as true, but not just on a theoretical basis."
4885,We may devise a number of experiments which illustrate the character of the law.
4886,"In order to do so, we need an accelerating charge."
4887,"It should be a single charge, but if we can make a great many charges move together, all the same way, we know that the field will be the sum of the effects of each of the individual charges; we just add them together."
4888,"As an example, consider two pieces of wire connected to a generator, as shown in Fig."
4889,28–1.
4890,The fact that we need two wires and a generator is merely that this is a way of doing it.
4891,A wire that is very short compared with the distance light travels in one oscillation period is called an electric dipole     oscillator.
4892,"If an electric field is applied to such a device, it will produce a force which will pull the electrons up on both wires or down on both wires."
4893,"When this probe feels an electric field, there will be a loud noise coming out of the loudspeaker, and when there is no electric field driving it, there will be no noise."
4894,"Because the room in which the waves we are measuring has other objects in it, our electric field will shake electrons in these other objects; the electric field makes these other charges go up and down, and in going up and down, these also produce an effect on our probe."
4895,"Thus for a successful experiment we must hold things fairly close together, so that the influences from the walls and from ourselves—the reflected waves—are relatively small."
4896,So the phenomena will not turn out to appear to be precisely and perfectly in accord with Eq.
4897,"(28.6), but will be close enough that we shall be able to appreciate the law."
4898,Now we turn the generator on and hear the audio signal.
4899,28–2).
4900,"That is all right, because our formula said that the field should be the acceleration of the charge projected     perpendicular to the line of sight."
4901,"So that checks the first rule, that there is no effect when the charge is moving directly toward us."
4902,"And this is just what we find, the electric field is indeed vertical, and not horizontal."
4903,"Next, we may test what happens when we have two sources side by side several wavelengths apart (Fig."
4904,28–3).
4905,Now comes an interesting possibility.
4906,"The fact that they are both moving can be checked, because if we cut one out, we can see the motion of the other."
4907,So the two of them together can produce zero if everything is adjusted correctly.
4908,"Now, it is very interesting to show that the addition of the two fields is in fact a vector addition."
4909,"We have just checked it for up and down motion, but let us check two nonparallel directions."
4910,28–4.
4911,"And if we turn it at right angles to that direction, we should get zero, which is easy to measure."
4912,"Indeed, we observe just such behavior!"
4913,"Now, how about the retardation?"
4914,How can we demonstrate that the signal is retarded?
4915,"We could, with a great deal of equipment, measure the time at which it arrives, but there is another, very simple way."
4916,Referring again to Fig.
4917,This completes our discussion of the experimental verification of some of the important features of Eq.
4918,(28.6).
4919,To do so would require rather sophisticated techniques and would hardly add to our understanding at this point.
4920,"In any case, we have checked those features that are of the greatest importance for our later applications, and we shall come back to study some of the other properties of electromagnetic waves next year."
4921,In this chapter we shall discuss the subject of the preceding chapter more mathematically.
4922,"We have qualitatively demonstrated that there are maxima and minima in the radiation field from two sources, and our problem now is to describe the field in mathematical detail, not just qualitatively."
4923,"We have already physically analyzed the meaning of formula (28.6) quite satisfactorily, but there are a few points to be made about it mathematically."
4924,29–1).
4925,Now it would be interesting to draw a picture of the field under different conditions.
4926,What we had been thinking of before is that we stand in one position and ask how the field there changes with time.
4927,"But instead of that, we are now going to see what the field looks like at different positions in space at a given instant."
4928,So what we want is a “snapshot” picture which tells us what the field is in different places.
4929,Of course it depends upon the acceleration of the charge.
4930,"Suppose that the charge at first had some particular motion: it was initially standing still, and it suddenly accelerated in some manner, as shown in Fig."
4931,"29–2, and then stopped."
4932,"Then, a little bit later, we measure the field at a different place."
4933,Then we may assert that the field will appear as shown in Fig.
4934,29–3.
4935,The field at farther and farther points is determined by the acceleration at earlier and earlier times.
4936,So the curve in Fig.
4937,"That is, as time goes on the field moves as a wave outward from the source."
4938,That is the reason why we sometimes say light is propagated as waves.
4939,"It is equivalent to saying that the field is delayed, or to saying that the electric field is moving outward as time goes on."
4940,"Now we must point out that the energy content of a wave, or the energy effects that such an electric field can have, are proportional to the square of the field, because if, for instance, we have some kind of a charge or an oscillator in the electric field, then if we let the field act on the oscillator, it makes it move."
4941,"If this is a linear oscillator, the acceleration, velocity, and displacement produced by the electric field acting on the charge are all proportional to the field."
4942,So the kinetic energy which is developed in the charge is proportional to the square of the field.
4943,So we shall take it that the energy that a field can deliver to a system is proportional somehow to the square of the field.
4944,"This means that the energy that the source can deliver decreases as we get farther away; in fact, it varies inversely as the square of the distance."
4945,"So the energy that we can take out of the wave within a given conical angle is the same, no matter how far away we are!"
4946,"In particular, the total energy that we could take out of the whole wave by putting absorbing oscillators all around is a certain fixed amount."
4947,"Thus we see that after a charge has oscillated, it has lost some energy which it can never recover; the energy keeps going farther and farther away without diminution."
4948,"So if we are far enough away that our basic approximation is good enough, the charge cannot recover the energy which has been, as we say, radiated away."
4949,"Of course the energy still exists somewhere, and is available to be picked up by other systems."
4950,We shall study this energy “loss” further in Chapter 32.
4951,"Let us now consider more carefully how the wave (29.3) varies as a function of time at a given place, and as a function of position at a given time."
4952,"We have already studied such a thing, so it should be quite familiar to us by now."
4953,Now we introduce a new quantity which is used a great deal in physics.
4954,This is defined as the rate of change of phase with distance (radians per meter).
4955,"That is, as we move in space at a fixed time, the phase changes."
4956,The wavelength is the distance occupied by one complete cycle.
4957,"That is, the wavelength and the frequency may not be related in the same way in other physical circumstances."
4958,"Now that we have introduced the idea of wavelength, we may say something more about the circumstances in which (29.1) is a legitimate formula."
4959,How far is “far enough”?
4960,"Thus, so long as we are beyond a few wavelengths, (29.1) is an excellent approximation to the field."
4961,Sometimes the region beyond a few wavelengths is called the “wave zone.”
4962,Next let us discuss the mathematics involved in combining the effects of two oscillators to find the net field at a given point.
4963,This is very easy in the few cases that we considered in the previous chapter.
4964,"We shall first describe the effects qualitatively, and then more quantitatively."
4965,"Let us take the simple case, where the oscillators are situated with their centers in the same horizontal plane as the detector, and the line of vibration is vertical."
4966,"Figure 29–5(a) represents the top view of two such oscillators, and in this particular example they are half a wavelength apart in a N–S direction, and are oscillating together in the same phase, which we call zero phase."
4967,Now we would like to know the intensity of the radiation in various directions.
4968,"By the intensity we mean the amount of energy that the field carries past us per second, which is proportional to the square of the field, averaged in time."
4969,"So the thing to look at, when we want to know how bright the light is, is the square of the electric field, not the electric field itself."
4970,"(The electric field tells the strength of the force felt by a stationary charge, but the amount of energy that is going past, in watts per square meter, is proportional to the square of the electric field."
4971,We shall derive the constant of proportionality in Chapter 31.)
4972,"If we look at the array from the W side, both oscillators contribute equally and in phase, so the electric field is twice as strong as it would be from a single oscillator."
4973,Therefore the intensity is four times as strong as it would be if there were only one oscillator.
4974,(The numbers in Fig.
4975,"29–5 represent how strong the intensity would be in this case, compared with what it would be if there were only a single oscillator of unit strength.)"
4976,"Now, in either the N or S direction along the line of the oscillators, since they are half a wavelength apart, the effect of one oscillator turns out to be out of phase by exactly half an oscillation from the other, and therefore the fields add to zero."
4977,We have to learn how to find these numbers at other angles.
4978,It is a question of adding two oscillations with different phases.
4979,Let us quickly look at some other cases of interest.
4980,29–5b).
4981,"In the W direction the intensity is now zero, because one oscillator is “pushing” when the other one is “pulling.” But in the N direction the signal from the near one comes at a certain time, and that of the other comes half a period later."
4982,Now we come to an interesting case which shows up a possibly useful feature.
4983,Let us remark that one of the reasons that phase relations of oscillators are interesting is for beaming radio transmitters.
4984,"For instance, if we build an antenna system and want to send a radio signal, say, to Hawaii, we set the antennas up as in Fig."
4985,"29–5(a) and we broadcast with our two antennas in phase, because Hawaii is to the west of us."
4986,"Then we decide that tomorrow we are going to broadcast toward Alberta, Canada."
4987,"Since that is north, not west, all we have to do is to reverse the phase of one of our antennas, and we can broadcast to the north."
4988,So we can build antenna systems with various arrangements.
4989,"Ours is one of the simplest possible ones; we can make them much more complicated, and by changing the phases in the various antennas we can send the beams in various directions and send most of the power in the direction in which we wish to transmit, without ever moving the antenna!"
4990,"In both of the preceding cases, however, while we are broadcasting toward Alberta we are wasting a lot of power on Easter Island, and it would be interesting to ask whether it is possible to send it in only one direction."
4991,At first sight we might think that with a pair of antennas of this nature the result is always going to be symmetrical.
4992,"So let us consider a case that comes out unsymmetrical, to show the possible variety."
4993,"If the antennas are separated by one-quarter wavelength, and if the N one is one-fourth period behind the S one in time, then what happens (Fig."
4994,29–6)?
4995,"Thus, by using some cleverness in spacing and phasing our antennas, we can send the power all in one direction."
4996,But still it is distributed over a great range of angles.
4997,Can we arrange it so that it is focused still more sharply in a particular direction?
4998,Can we do better than that?
4999,Let us take a situation in which the separation is ten wavelengths (Fig.
5000,"29–7), which is more nearly comparable to the situation in which we experimented in the previous chapter, with separations of several wavelengths rather than a small fraction of a wavelength."
5001,Here the picture is quite different.
5002,"If the oscillators are ten wavelengths apart (we take the in-phase case to make it easy), we see that in the E–W direction, they are in phase, and we get a strong intensity, four times what we would get if one of them were there alone."
5003,So this first null occurs when that happens.
5004,(The figure is not drawn to scale; it is only a rough sketch.)
5005,"This means that we do indeed have a very sharp beam in the direction we want, because if we just move over a little bit we lose all our intensity."
5006,"Now how can we arrange to get rid of all these extra maxima, or “lobes,” as they are called?"
5007,We could get rid of the unwanted lobes in a rather interesting way.
5008,Suppose that we were to place another set of antennas between the two that we already have.
5009,"There are now six antennas, and if we looked at the intensity in the E–W direction, it would, of course, be much higher with six antennas than with one."
5010,The field would be six times and the intensity thirty-six times as great (the square of the field).
5011,"Now if we look at neighboring points, we find a zero as before, roughly, but if we go farther, to where we used to get a big “bump,” we get a much smaller “bump” now."
5012,Let us try to see why.
5013,Therefore there is very little intensity in this direction—but there is something; it does not balance exactly.
5014,"This kind of thing keeps on happening; we get very little bumps, and we have the strong beam in the direction where we want it."
5015,It is easy to avoid this in practice because it is possible to put the dipoles closer than one wavelength apart.
5016,"If we put in more antennas, closer than one wavelength apart, then this cannot happen."
5017,"But the fact that this can happen at certain angles, if the spacing is bigger than one wavelength, is a very interesting and useful phenomenon in other applications—not radio broadcasting, but in diffraction gratings."
5018,"Now we have finished our analysis of the phenomena of dipole radiators qualitatively, and we must learn how to analyze them quantitatively."
5019,"It is very easy to find this phase difference; it is made up of a delay due to the difference in distance, and the intrinsic, built-in phase of the oscillation."
5020,How do we do it?
5021,"It is really very easy, and we presume that we already know how to do it."
5022,"However, we shall outline the procedure in some detail."
5023,"First, we can, if we are clever with mathematics and know enough about cosines and sines, simply work it out."
5024,Now suppose that we cannot remember that the sum of two cosines is twice the cosine of half the sum times the cosine of half the difference.
5025,Then we may use another method of analysis which is more geometrical.
5026,29–9).
5027,The system goes around like a rigid body.
5028,That solves our problem.
5029,"In this case, we see from Fig."
5030,"Clearly, we can also solve for the case where the amplitudes are not equal, just as easily."
5031,We can call that the geometrical way of solving the problem.
5032,"There is still another way of solving the problem, and that is the analytical way."
5033,"That is, instead of having actually to draw a picture like Fig."
5034,"29–9, we can write something down which says the same thing as the picture: instead of drawing the vectors, we write a complex number to represent each of the vectors."
5035,The real parts of the complex numbers are the actual physical quantities.
5036,"To get the “length” of a complex quantity, we always multiply the quantity by its complex conjugate, which gives the length squared."
5037,"29–9, using the rules of trigonometry."
5038,This correction we call the interference effect.
5039,"It is really only the difference between what we get simply by adding the intensities, and what actually happens."
5040,We call it interference whether it is positive or negative.
5041,"(Interference in ordinary language usually suggests opposition or hindrance, but in physics we often do not use language the way it was originally designed!)"
5042,"If the interference term is positive, we call that case constructive interference, horrible though it may sound to anybody other than a physicist!"
5043,The opposite case is called destructive interference.
5044,Now let us see how to apply our general formula (29.16) for the case of two oscillators to the special situations which we have discussed qualitatively.
5045,"(It depends only on the phase difference, of course, and not on the phase itself.)"
5046,29–10).]
5047,Now let us see what happens in our various cases.
5048,All the other cases can be worked out in this same way.
5049,"This chapter is a direct continuation of the previous one, although the name has been changed from Interference to Diffraction."
5050,No one has ever been able to define the difference between interference and diffraction satisfactorily.
5051,"It is just a question of usage, and there is no specific, important physical difference between them."
5052,"The best we can do, roughly speaking, is to say that when there are only a few sources, say two, interfering, then the result is usually called interference, but if there is a large number of them, it seems that the word diffraction is more often used."
5053,"So, we shall not worry about whether it is interference or diffraction, but continue directly from where we left off in the middle of the subject in the last chapter."
5054,Now we must add all the terms together.
5055,We shall do this geometrically.
5056,30–1).
5057,"Now the vertices, of course, all lie on a circle, and we can find the net amplitude most easily if we find the radius of that circle."
5058,Now let us analyze this expression and study some of its consequences.
5059,Now the idea that led us to consider the addition of several sources was that we might get a much stronger intensity in one direction than in another; that the nearby maxima which would have been present if there were only two sources will have gone down in strength.
5060,30–2).
5061,In terms of what is happening with the arrows in Fig.
5062,"Now we go to the next maximum, and we want to see that it is really much smaller than the first one, as we had hoped."
5063,This corresponds to the arrows having traversed the circle one and a half times.
5064,Of course there are decreasing intensities farther out.
5065,So we have a very sharp central maximum with very weak subsidiary maxima on the sides.
5066,30–2.
5067,Now let us consider further how we may apply Eq.
5068,"(30.3) in different circumstances, and try to understand what is happening."
5069,"Let us consider our sources to be all on a line, as drawn in Fig."
5070,30–3.
5071,"On the other hand, an interesting question is, where is the first minimum?"
5072,Referring to Fig.
5073,The arrows (Fig.
5074,"30–1) are going around a whole circle—we are adding equal vectors in all directions, and such a sum is zero."
5075,That is the first minimum.
5076,Near each of these great maxima the pattern of Fig.
5077,30–2 is repeated.
5078,"We may ask ourselves, what is the geometrical circumstance that leads to these other great maxima?"
5079,"(Of course, there is also a beam in the opposite direction.)"
5080,"In technical work with antennas and wires it is possible to arrange that all the phases of the little oscillators, or antennas, are equal."
5081,The question is whether and how we can do a similar thing with light.
5082,We cannot at the present time literally make little optical-frequency radio stations and hook them up with infinitesimal wires and drive them all with a given phase.
5083,But there is a very easy way to do what amounts to the same thing.
5084,"(One can work out cases with curved arrays, but let us take a plane one.)"
5085,Then the external electric field will drive the electrons up and down in each wire.
5086,"That is, the field which is coming from the original source will shake the electrons up and down, and in moving, these represent new generators."
5087,"This phenomenon is called scattering: a light wave from some source can induce a motion of the electrons in a piece of material, and these motions generate their own waves."
5088,"Therefore all that is necessary is to set up a lot of wires, equally spaced, drive them with a radiofrequency source far away, and we have the situation that we want, without a whole lot of special wiring."
5089,"If the incidence is normal, the phases will be equal, and we will get exactly the circumstance we have been discussing."
5090,"Therefore, if the wire spacing is greater than the wavelength, we will get a strong intensity of scattering in the normal direction, and in certain other directions given by (30.6)."
5091,This can also be done with light!
5092,"Instead of wires, we use a flat piece of glass and make notches in it such that each of the notches scatters a little differently than the rest of the glass."
5093,"If we then shine light on the glass, each one of the notches will represent a source, and if we space the lines very finely, but not closer than a wavelength (which is technically almost impossible anyway), then we would expect a miraculous phenomenon: the light not only will pass straight through, but there will also be a strong beam at a finite angle, depending on the spacing of the notches!"
5094,Such objects have actually been made and are in common use—they are called diffraction gratings.
5095,"In one of its forms, a diffraction grating consists of nothing but a plane glass sheet, transparent and colorless, with scratches on it."
5096,"There are often several hundred scratches to the millimeter, very carefully arranged so as to be equally spaced."
5097,"The effect of such a grating can be seen by arranging a projector so as to throw a narrow, vertical line of light (the image of a slit) onto a screen."
5098,"When we put the grating into the beam, with its scratches vertical, we see that the line is still there but, in addition, on each side we have another strong patch of light which is colored."
5099,"And we do, in fact, find that red is at a greater angle out from the central image!"
5100,"There should also be a beam on the other side, and indeed we see one on the screen."
5101,We do see that there is something vaguely there—very weak—and there are even other beams beyond.
5102,"We have just argued that all these beams ought to be of the same strength, but we see that they actually are not and, in fact, not even the first ones on the right and left are equal!"
5103,The reason is that the grating has been carefully built to do just this.
5104,How?
5105,"If the grating consists of very fine notches, infinitesimally wide, spaced evenly, then all the intensities would indeed be equal."
5106,"But, as a matter of fact, although we have taken the simplest case, we could also have considered an array of pairs of antennas, in which each member of the pair has a certain strength and some relative phase."
5107,"In this case, it is possible to get intensities which are different in the different orders."
5108,A grating is often made with little “sawtooth” cuts instead of little symmetrical notches.
5109,"By carefully arranging the “sawteeth,” more light may be sent into one particular order of spectrum than into the others."
5110,"In a practical grating, we would like to have as much light as possible in one of the orders."
5111,"This may seem a complicated point to bring in, but it is a very clever thing to do, because it makes the grating more useful."
5112,"So far, we have taken the case where all the phases of the sources are equal."
5113,That requires wiring up our antennas with a slight phase shift between each one.
5114,Can we do that with light?
5115,30–4).
5116,There are several interesting points to be noted.
5117,"We might think that the light “goes right through.” No, it is different light that we are talking about."
5118,The light that goes right through is from the original source; what we are talking about is the new light which is generated by scattering.
5119,"It turns out that the scattered light is going in the same direction as the original light, in fact it can interfere with it—a feature which we will study later."
5120,"So not only do we get a beam in the same direction as the incoming beam but also one in another direction, such that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of scattering."
5121,This we call the reflected beam.
5122,"So we begin to understand the basic machinery of reflection: the light that comes in generates motions of the atoms in the reflector, and the reflector then regenerates a new wave, and one of the solutions for the direction of scattering, the only solution if the spacing of the scatterers is small compared with one wavelength, is that the angle at which the light comes out is equal to the angle at which it comes in!"
5123,"That is, we have just a solid piece of material, so to speak, but of finite length."
5124,"In addition, we want the phase shift from one scatterer to the next to go to zero."
5125,"In other words, we put more and more antennas between the other ones, so that each of the phase differences is getting smaller, but the number of antennas is increasing in such a way that the total phase difference, between one end of the line and the other, is constant."
5126,30–2.
5127,"So we can even analyze a continuous distribution of scatterers or oscillators, by using integrals instead of summing."
5128,"As an example, suppose there were a long line of oscillators, with the charge oscillating along the direction of the line (Fig."
5129,30–5).
5130,From such an array the greatest intensity is perpendicular to the line.
5131,"There is a little bit of intensity up and down from the equatorial plane, but it is very slight."
5132,"With this result, we can handle a more complicated situation."
5133,"Suppose we have a set of such lines, each producing a beam only in a plane perpendicular to the line."
5134,"To find the intensity in various directions from a series of long wires, instead of infinitesimal wires, is the same problem as it was for infinitesimal wires, so long as we are in the central plane perpendicular to the wires; we just add the contribution from each of the long wires."
5135,"That is why, although we actually analyzed only tiny antennas, we might as well have used a grating with long, narrow slots."
5136,"Each of the long slots produces an effect only in its own direction, not up and down, but they are all set next to each other horizontally, so they produce interference that way."
5137,"Thus we can build up more complicated situations by having various distributions of scatterers in lines, planes, or in space."
5138,"The first thing we did was to consider scatterers in a line, and we have just extended the analysis to strips; we can work it out by just doing the necessary summations, adding the contributions from the individual scatterers."
5139,The principle is always the same.
5140,We are now in a position to understand a number of interesting phenomena.
5141,"For example, consider the use of a grating for separating wavelengths."
5142,"We noticed that the whole spectrum was spread out on the screen, so a grating can be used as an instrument for separating light into its different wavelengths."
5143,"One of the interesting questions is: supposing that there were two sources of slightly different frequency, or slightly different wavelength, how close together in wavelength could they be such that the grating would be unable to tell that there were really two different wavelengths there?"
5144,The red and the blue were clearly separated.
5145,"But when one wave is red and the other is slightly redder, very close, how close can they be?"
5146,"This is called the resolving power of the grating, and one way of analyzing the problem is as follows."
5147,Suppose that for light of a certain color we happen to have the maximum of the diffracted beam occurring at a certain angle.
5148,That is why the red and blue are spread out.
5149,How different in angle must it be in order for us to be able to see it?
5150,"If the two maxima are exactly on top of each other, of course we cannot see them."
5151,"If the maximum of one is far enough away from the other, then we can see that there is a double bump in the distribution of light."
5152,"In order to be able to just make out the double bump, the following simple criterion, called Rayleigh’s criterion, is usually used (Fig."
5153,30–6).
5154,It is that the first minimum from one bump should sit at the maximum of the other.
5155,"Now it is very easy to calculate, when one minimum sits on the other maximum, how much the difference in wavelength is."
5156,The best way to do it is geometrically.
5157,Now let us consider another problem in resolving power.
5158,"This has to do with the antenna of a radio telescope, used for determining the position of radio sources in the sky, i.e., how large they are in angle."
5159,"Of course if we use any old antenna and find signals, we would not know from what direction they came."
5160,We are very interested to know whether the source is in one place or another.
5161,One way we can find out is to lay out a whole series of equally spaced dipole wires on the Australian landscape.
5162,"Then we take all the wires from these antennas and feed them into the same receiver, in such a way that all the delays in the feed lines are equal."
5163,Thus the receiver receives signals from all of the dipoles in phase.
5164,"That is, it adds all the waves from every one of the dipoles in the same phase."
5165,Now what happens?
5166,"If the source is directly above the array, at infinity or nearly so, then its radiowaves will excite all the antennas in the same phase, so they all feed the receiver together."
5167,Then the various antennas are receiving signals a little out of phase.
5168,How big may the angle be?
5169,This is because the vector contributions form together a complete polygon with zero resultant.
5170,Notice that the receiving pattern of an antenna such as this is exactly the same as the intensity distribution we would get if we turned the receiver around and made it into a transmitter.
5171,This is an example of what is called a reciprocity principle.
5172,"It turns out, in fact, to be generally true for any arrangement of antennas, angles, and so on, that if we first work out what the relative intensities would be in various directions if the receiver were a transmitter instead, then the relative directional sensitivity of a receiver with the same external wiring, the same array of antennas, is the same as the relative intensity of emission would be if it were a transmitter."
5173,Some radio antennas are made in a different way.
5174,"Instead of having a whole lot of dipoles in a long line, with a lot of feed wires, we may arrange them not in a line but in a curve, and put the receiver at a certain point where it can detect the scattered waves."
5175,"This curve is cleverly designed so that if the radiowaves are coming down from above, and the wires scatter, making a new wave, the wires are so arranged that the scattered waves reach the receiver all at the same time (Fig."
5176,26–12).
5177,"In other words, the curve is a parabola, and when the source is exactly on its axis, we get a very strong intensity at the focus."
5178,In this case we understand very clearly what the resolving power of such an instrument is.
5179,The arranging of the antennas on a parabolic curve is not an essential point.
5180,It is only a convenient way to get all the signals to the same point with no relative delay and without feed wires.
5181,It does not depend on the spacing of the antennas and they may be very close together or in fact be all one piece of metal.
5182,"Now we are describing a telescope mirror, of course."
5183,We have found the resolving power of a telescope!
5184,"In any case, it seems a little pedantic to put such precision into the resolving power formula.2)"
5185,"The above, then, are some of the effects of interference obtained by adding the various waves."
5186,"But there are a number of other examples, and even though we do not understand the fundamental mechanism yet, we will some day, and we can understand even now how the interference occurs."
5187,The reason for the reflection we are not in a position to understand right now; we shall discuss it later.
5188,But suppose we know that some of the light is reflected both on entering and leaving a refracting medium.
5189,"Then, if we look at the reflection of a light source in a thin film, we see the sum of two waves; if the thicknesses are small enough, these two waves will produce an interference, either constructive or destructive, depending on the signs of the phases."
5190,"It might be, for instance, that for red light, we get an enhanced reflection, but for blue light, which has a different wavelength, perhaps we get a destructively interfering reflection, so that we see a bright red reflection."
5191,"If we change the thickness, i.e., if we look at another place where the film is thicker, it may be reversed, the red interfering and the blue not, so it is bright blue, or green, or yellow, or whatnot."
5192,"So we see colors when we look at thin films and the colors change if we look at different angles, because we can appreciate that the timings are different at different angles."
5193,"Thus we suddenly appreciate another hundred thousand situations involving the colors that we see on oil films, soap bubbles, etc."
5194,at different angles.
5195,But the principle is all the same: we are only adding waves at different phases.
5196,"As another important application of diffraction, we may mention the following."
5197,We used a grating and we saw the diffracted image on the screen.
5198,"If we had used monochromatic light, it would have been at a certain specific place."
5199,Then there were various higher-order images also.
5200,"From the positions of the images, we could tell how far apart the lines on the grating were, if we knew the wavelength of the light."
5201,"From the difference in intensity of the various images, we could find out the shape of the grating scratches, whether the grating was made of wires, sawtooth notches, or whatever, without being able to see them."
5202,This principle is used to discover the positions of the atoms in a crystal.
5203,The only complication is that a crystal is three-dimensional; it is a repeating three-dimensional array of atoms.
5204,"We cannot use ordinary light, because we must use something whose wavelength is less than the space between the atoms or we get no effect; so we must use radiation of very short wavelength, i.e., x-rays."
5205,"So, by shining x-rays into a crystal and by noticing how intense is the reflection in the various orders, we can determine the arrangement of the atoms inside without ever being able to see them with the eye!"
5206,"It is in this way that we know the arrangement of the atoms in various substances, which permitted us to draw those pictures in the first chapter, showing the arrangement of atoms in salt, and so on."
5207,"We shall later come back to this subject and discuss it in more detail, and therefore we say no more about this most remarkable idea at present."
5208,Now we come to a very interesting situation.
5209,"Suppose that we have an opaque sheet with holes in it, and a light on one side of it."
5210,We want to know what the intensity is on the other side.
5211,"What most people say is that the light shines through the holes, and produces an effect on the other side."
5212,"It will turn out that one gets the right answer, to an excellent approximation, if he assumes that there are sources distributed with uniform density across the open holes, and that the phases of these sources are the same as they would have been if the opaque material were absent."
5213,"Of course, actually there are no sources at the holes, in fact that is the only place that there are certainly no sources."
5214,"Nevertheless, we get the correct diffraction patterns by considering the holes to be the only places that there are sources; that is a rather peculiar fact."
5215,"We shall explain later why this is true, but for now let us just suppose that it is."
5216,In the theory of diffraction there is another kind of diffraction that we should briefly discuss.
5217,"It is usually not discussed in an elementary course as early as this, only because the mathematical formulas involved in adding these little vectors are a little elaborate."
5218,Otherwise it is exactly the same as we have been doing all along.
5219,"All the interference phenomena are the same; there is nothing very much more advanced involved, only the circumstances are more complicated and it is harder to add the vectors together, that is all."
5220,"Suppose that we have light coming in from infinity, casting a shadow of an object."
5221,"Now we would expect that outside the shadow, the intensity is all bright, and inside it, it is all dark."
5222,"As a matter of fact, if we plot the intensity as a function of position near the shadow edge, the intensity rises and then overshoots, and wobbles, and oscillates about in a very peculiar manner near this edge (Fig."
5223,30–9).
5224,We now shall discuss the reason for this.
5225,"If we use the theorem that we have not yet proved, then we can replace the actual problem by a set of effective sources uniformly distributed over the open space beyond the object."
5226,That looks just like what we have been doing.
5227,Not quite; because our screen is not at infinity.
5228,"We do not want the intensity at infinity, but at a finite point."
5229,"To calculate the intensity at some particular place, we have to add the contributions from all the antennas."
5230,"When the phases are linearly proportional, each vector adds at a constant angle to the next vector."
5231,"What we now need is a curve which is made by adding a lot of infinitesimal vectors with the requirement that the angle they make shall increase, not linearly, but as the square of the length of the curve."
5232,"To construct that curve involves slightly advanced mathematics, but we can always construct it by actually drawing the arrows and measuring the angles."
5233,"In any case, we get the marvelous curve (called Cornu’s spiral) shown in Fig."
5234,30–8.
5235,Now how do we use this curve?
5236,"30–8, and draw a series of arrows of ever-increasing angle."
5237,30–9).
5238,"One point that we can immediately calculate with ease, to show that we really understand it, is the intensity exactly opposite the edge."
5239,30–8) we have half the curve that we would have had if we were far into the bright region.
5240,In this chapter we have been finding the intensity produced in various directions from various distributions of sources.
5241,As a final example we shall derive a formula which we shall need for the next chapter on the theory of the index of refraction.
5242,"Up to this point relative intensities have been sufficient for our purpose, but this time we shall find the complete formula for the field in the following situation."
5243,"Suppose that we have a plane full of sources, all oscillating together, with their motion in the plane and all having the same amplitude and phase."
5244,"What is the field at a finite, but very large, distance away from the plane?"
5245,"(We cannot get very close, of course, because we do not have the right formulas for the field close to the sources.)"
5246,30–10).
5247,"All of the charges move with simple harmonic motion, with the same direction, amplitude, and phase."
5248,"We should, of course, make a vector sum."
5249,"But since the direction of the electric field is nearly the same for all the charges, we may, in keeping with the approximation we have already made, just add the magnitudes of the fields."
5250,"But in a physical situation, it can mean something quite reasonable, and usually can just be taken to be zero."
5251,"To see that this is so in our case, we go back to consider again the original integral (30.15)."
5252,We can try to evaluate the sum by a graphical method.
5253,In Fig.
5254,30–11 we have drawn the first five pieces of the sum.
5255,The sum for these first five pieces is represented by the arrow from the starting point to the end of the fifth segment.
5256,As we continue to add pieces we shall trace out a polygon until we get back to the starting point (approximately) and then start around once more.
5257,We can see now why the integral does not give a definite answer!
5258,But now we have to go back to the physics of the situation.
5259,"In any real situation the plane of charges cannot be infinite in extent, but must sometime stop."
5260,"If it stopped suddenly, and was exactly circular in shape, our integral would have some value on the circle in Fig."
5261,30–11.
5262,"Since we are adding smaller pieces but still turning through the same angle, the graph of our integral would then become a curve which is a spiral."
5263,"The spiral would eventually end up at the center of our original circle, as drawn in Fig."
5264,30–12.
5265,This is the same result we would get from Eq.
5266,But that is the way it comes out—fortunately a rather simple formula.
5267,"We have said before that light goes slower in water than in air, and slower, slightly, in air than in vacuum."
5268,Now we would like to understand how such a slower velocity could come about.
5269,"In particular, we should try to see what the relation is to some physical assumptions, or statements, we made earlier, which were the following: 
That the total electric field in any physical circumstance can always be represented by the sum of the fields from all the charges in the universe."
5270,"But, for a piece of glass, you might think: “Oh, no, you should modify all this."
5271,Our problem is to understand how the apparently slower velocity comes about.
5272,We shall try to understand the effect in a very simple case.
5273,"A source which we shall call “the external source” is placed a large distance away from a thin plate of transparent material, say glass."
5274,We inquire about the field at a large distance on the opposite side of the plate.
5275,The situation is illustrated by the diagram of Fig.
5276,Remember that the contribution of each charge is not changed by the presence of the other charges.
5277,These are our basic principles.
5278,Why should there be charges moving in the glass?
5279,We know that all material consists of atoms which contain electrons.
5280,"When the electric field of the source acts on these atoms it drives the electrons up and down, because it exerts a force on the electrons."
5281,And moving electrons generate a field—they constitute new radiators.
5282,"This means that the field is not the same as the one which was there before the glass was there, but is modified, and it turns out that it is modified in such a way that the field inside the glass appears to be moving at a different speed."
5283,That is the idea which we would like to work out quantitatively.
5284,"Now this is, in the exact case, pretty complicated, because although we have said that all the other moving charges are driven by the source field, that is not quite true."
5285,"If we think of a particular charge, it feels not only the source, but like anything else in the world, it feels all of the charges that are moving."
5286,"It feels, in particular, the charges that are moving somewhere else in the glass."
5287,"So the total field which is acting on a particular charge is a combination of the fields from the other charges, whose motions depend on what this particular charge is doing!"
5288,You can see that it would take a complicated set of equations to get the complete and exact formula.
5289,It is so complicated that we postpone this problem until next year.
5290,Instead we shall work out a very simple case in order to understand all the physical principles very clearly.
5291,We take a circumstance in which the effects from the other atoms are very small relative to the effects from the source.
5292,"In other words, we take a material in which the total field is not modified very much by the motion of the other charges."
5293,"In this way we shall avoid the complications of the most general, complete solution."
5294,"Incidentally, you should notice that there is another effect caused by the motion of the charges in the plate."
5295,This backward-going field is the light we see reflected from the surfaces of transparent materials.
5296,It does not come from just the surface.
5297,"The backward radiation comes from everywhere in the interior, but it turns out that the total effect is equivalent to a reflection from the surfaces."
5298,"Before we proceed with our study of how the index of refraction comes about, we should understand that all that is required to understand refraction is to understand why the apparent wave velocity is different in different materials."
5299,The bending of light rays comes about just because the effective speed of the waves is different in the materials.
5300,To remind you how that comes about we have drawn in Fig.
5301,31–2 several successive crests of an electric wave which arrives from a vacuum onto the surface of a block of glass.
5302,The arrow perpendicular to the wave crests indicates the direction of travel of the wave.
5303,Now all oscillations in the wave must have the same frequency.
5304,(We have seen that driven oscillations have the same frequency as the driving source.)
5305,"This means, also, that the wave crests for the waves on both sides of the surface must have the same spacing along the surface because they must travel together, so that a charge sitting at the boundary will feel only one frequency."
5306,"The shortest distance between crests of the wave, however, is the wavelength which is the velocity divided by the frequency."
5307,From the figure we can see that the only way for the waves to “fit” properly at the boundary is for the waves in the material to be travelling at a different angle with respect to the surface.
5308,We go back now to the situation shown in Fig.
5309,31–1.
5310,(31.2).
5311,"This is probably the most complicated thing that we are going to do this year, but it is complicated only in that there are many pieces that have to be put together; each piece, however, is very simple."
5312,"Unlike other derivations where we say, “Forget the derivation, just look at the answer!,” in this case we do not need the answer so much as the derivation."
5313,"In other words, the thing to understand now is the physical machinery for the production of the index."
5314,Now what would happen if the wave travelled more slowly in going through the plate?
5315,"However, that is really all right because we can get the same result by adding a suitable complex number."
5316,What we have been doing is easily visualized if we look at the complex number diagram in Fig.
5317,31–3.
5318,(31.8).
5319,(31.8) the kind we would expect from oscillating charges in the plate?
5320,(31.8).]
5321,"(To help you keep track of the many symbols we have used up to now, and will be using in the rest of our calculation, we have put them all together in Table 31–1.)"
5322,"To find what motion we expect for the electrons, we will assume that the atoms are little oscillators, that is, that the electrons are fastened elastically to the atoms, which means that if a force is applied to an electron its displacement from its normal position will be proportional to the force."
5323,You may think that this is a funny model of an atom if you have heard about electrons whirling around in orbits.
5324,But that is just an oversimplified picture.
5325,"The correct picture of an atom, which is given by the theory of wave mechanics, says that, so far as problems involving light are concerned, the electrons behave as though they were held by springs."
5326,"And it is the same for every electron, except that the mean position (the “zero” of the motion) is, of course, different for each electron."
5327,Referring back to Eq.
5328,Notice that in the above process we have obtained something very interesting.
5329,"We do not know this just yet, because it is different for every different material, and we cannot get a general theory of that now."
5330,"Formulation of a general theory of the properties of different substances—their natural frequencies, and so on—is possible only with quantum atomic mechanics."
5331,"Also, different materials have different properties and different indexes, so we cannot expect, anyway, to get a general formula for the index which will apply to all substances."
5332,"However, we shall discuss the formula we have obtained, in various possible circumstances."
5333,"First of all, for most ordinary gases (for instance, for air, most colorless gases, hydrogen, helium, and so on) the natural frequencies of the electron oscillators correspond to ultraviolet light."
5334,Then we find that the index is nearly constant.
5335,"So for a gas, the index is nearly constant."
5336,"This is also true for most other transparent substances, like glass."
5337,The index is higher for blue light than for red light.
5338,That is the reason why a prism bends the light more in the blue than in the red.
5339,"The phenomenon that the index depends upon the frequency is called the phenomenon of dispersion, because it is the basis of the fact that light is “dispersed” by a prism into a spectrum."
5340,The equation for the index of refraction as a function of frequency is called a dispersion equation.
5341,So we have obtained a dispersion equation.
5342,(In the past few years “dispersion equations” have been finding a new use in the theory of elementary particles.)
5343,Our dispersion equation suggests other interesting effects.
5344,"This would occur, for example, if we take a material like glass, say, and shine x-ray radiation on it."
5345,"In fact, since many materials which are opaque to visible light, like graphite for instance, are transparent to x-rays, we can also talk about the index of refraction of carbon for x-rays."
5346,"All the natural frequencies of the carbon atoms would be much lower than the frequency we are using in the x-rays, since x-ray radiation has a very high frequency."
5347,A similar situation would occur if we beam radiowaves (or light) on a gas of free electrons.
5348,In the upper atmosphere electrons are liberated from their atoms by ultraviolet light from the sun and they sit up there as free electrons.
5349,Can that be correct?
5350,It is correct.
5351,This just means that the phase shift which is produced by the scattered light can be either positive or negative.
5352,"It can be shown, however, that the speed at which you can send a signal is not determined by the index at one frequency, but depends on what the index is at many frequencies."
5353,What the index tells us is the speed at which the nodes (or crests) of the wave travel.
5354,The node of a wave is not a signal by itself.
5355,"In a perfect wave, which has no modulations of any kind, i.e., which is a steady oscillation, you cannot really say when it “starts,” so you cannot use it for a timing signal."
5356,"In order to send a signal you have to change the wave somehow, make a notch in it, make it a little bit fatter or thinner."
5357,"That means that you have to have more than one frequency in the wave, and it can be shown that the speed at which signals travel is not dependent upon the index alone, but upon the way that the index changes with the frequency."
5358,This subject we must also delay (until Chapter 48).
5359,"Then we will calculate for you the actual speed of signals through such a piece of glass, and you will see that it will not be faster than the speed of light, although the nodes, which are mathematical points, do travel faster than the speed of light."
5360,"Just to give a slight hint as to how that happens, you will note that the real difficulty has to do with the fact that the responses of the charges are opposite to the field, i.e., the sign has gotten reversed."
5361,"The formula says that when the electric field is pulling in one direction, the charge is moving in the opposite direction."
5362,How does the charge happen to be going in the opposite direction?
5363,It certainly does not start off in the opposite direction when the field is first turned on.
5364,"When the motion first starts there is a transient, which settles down after awhile, and only then is the phase of the oscillation of the charge opposite to the driving field."
5365,And it is then that the phase of the transmitted field can appear to be advanced with respect to the source wave.
5366,In Fig.
5367,31–4 we give a schematic idea of how the waves might look for a case where the wave is suddenly turned on (to make a signal).
5368,"You will see from the diagram that the signal (i.e., the start of the wave) is not earlier for the wave which ends up with an advance in phase."
5369,Let us now look again at our dispersion equation.
5370,We should remark that our analysis of the refractive index gives a result that is somewhat simpler than you would actually find in nature.
5371,To be completely accurate we must add some refinements.
5372,"First, we should expect that our model of the atomic oscillator should have some damping force (otherwise once started it would oscillate forever, and we do not expect that to happen)."
5373,We have worked out before (Eq.
5374,23.8) the motion of a damped oscillator and the result is that the denominator in Eq.
5375,We need a second modification to take into account the fact that there are several resonant frequencies for a particular kind of atom.
5376,"It is easy to fix up our dispersion equation by imagining that there are several different kinds of oscillators, but that each oscillator acts separately, and so we simply add the contributions of all the oscillators."
5377,31–5(a).
5378,Such a positive slope is called “normal” dispersion (because it is clearly the most common occurrence).
5379,"Such a negative slope is often referred to as “anomalous” (meaning abnormal) dispersion, because it seemed unusual when it was first observed, long before anyone even knew there were such things as electrons."
5380,From our point of view both slopes are quite “normal”!
5381,Perhaps you have noticed something a little strange about the last form (Eq.
5382,31.20) we obtained for our dispersion equation.
5383,What does that mean?
5384,We can see what such a complex index means when there is only one resonant frequency by going back to Eq.
5385,"Also, the exponent is negative, so the factor is a real number less than one."
5386,"As the wave goes through the material, it is weakened."
5387,The material is “absorbing” part of the wave.
5388,The wave comes out the other side with less energy.
5389,"We should not be surprised at this, because the damping we put in for the oscillators is indeed a friction force and must be expected to cause a loss of energy."
5390,31–3 toward the origin.
5391,It is clear why the transmitted field is then decreased.
5392,"Normally, for instance as in glass, the absorption of light is very small."
5393,This is to be expected from our Eq.
5394,31–5(b).
5395,The absorption of the light becomes the dominant effect.
5396,It is just this effect that gives the dark lines in the spectrum of light which we receive from the sun.
5397,"The light from the solar surface has passed through the sun’s atmosphere (as well as the earth’s), and the light has been strongly absorbed at the resonant frequencies of the atoms in the solar atmosphere."
5398,The observation of such spectral lines in the sunlight allows us to tell the resonant frequencies of the atoms and hence the chemical composition of the sun’s atmosphere.
5399,The same kind of observations tell us about the materials in the stars.
5400,From such measurements we know that the chemical elements in the sun and in the stars are the same as those we find on the earth.
5401,We have seen that the imaginary part of the index means absorption.
5402,We shall now use this knowledge to find out how much energy is carried by a light wave.
5403,"If we consider the light arriving on a unit area, say one square centimeter, of our plate in Fig."
5404,"31–1, then we can write the following energy equation (if we assume that energy is conserved, as we do!"
5405,Ours is what should be called a “low-density approximation.”
5406,"In the same spirit, we might remark that our energy equation has neglected the energy in the reflected wave."
5407,For the last term in Eq.
5408,(31.23) we wish to compute the rate at which the incoming wave is doing work on the electrons.
5409,"We know that work is force times distance, so the rate of doing work (also called power) is the force times the velocity."
5410,Putting Eq.
5411,We have a nice bonus result from our theory of the refractive index!
5412,It is now a good time to take up a somewhat different matter which we can handle with the machinery of this chapter.
5413,"In the last chapter we said that when you have an opaque screen and the light can come through some holes, the distribution of intensity—the diffraction pattern—could be obtained by imagining instead that the holes are replaced by sources (oscillators) uniformly distributed over the hole."
5414,"In other words, the diffracted wave is the same as though the hole were a new source."
5415,"We have to explain the reason for that, because the hole is, of course, just where there are no sources, where there are no accelerating charges."
5416,31–6(a).
5417,Why is there no field there?
5418,You say: “What a miracle that it balances exactly!
5419,"Suppose it was not exactly right!” If it were not exactly right (remember that this opaque screen has some thickness), the field toward the rear part of the screen would not be exactly zero."
5420,"So, not being zero, it would set into motion some other charges in the material of the screen, and thus make a little more field, trying to get the total balanced out."
5421,"So if we make the screen thick enough, there is no residual field, because there is enough opportunity to finally get the thing quieted down."
5422,"In terms of our formulas above we would say that the screen has a large and imaginary index, so the wave is absorbed exponentially as it goes through."
5423,"You know, of course, that a thin enough sheet of the most opaque material, even gold, is transparent."
5424,"Now let us see what happens with an opaque screen which has holes in it, as in Fig."
5425,31–6(b).
5426,"We might expect the motions of the charges in the walls to be complicated, but we can find out what fields they produce in a rather simple way."
5427,"Suppose that we were to take the same screen, but plug up the holes, as indicated in part (c) of the figure."
5428,We imagine that the plugs are of exactly the same material as the wall.
5429,"Mind you, the plugs go where the holes were in case (b)."
5430,"(The sign is not too interesting, since we are usually interested in intensity which is proportional to the square of the field.)"
5431,It seems like an amazing backwards-forwards argument.
5432,"It is, however, not only true (approximately for not too small holes), but useful, and is the justification for the usual theory of diffraction."
5433,"We remark again that this theory of diffraction is only approximate, and will be good only if the holes are not too small."
5434,"(The photos for chapter 33, which includes the summary for this lecture, are missing from the Caltech Archives.)"
5435,"In the last chapter we learned that when a system is oscillating, energy is carried away, and we deduced a formula for the energy which is radiated by an oscillating system."
5436,"If the system radiates energy, then in order to account for the conservation of energy we must find that power is being delivered along the wires which lead into the antenna."
5437,"That is, to the driving circuit the antenna acts like a resistance, or a place where energy can be “lost” (the energy is not really lost, it is really radiated out, but so far as the circuit is concerned, the energy is lost)."
5438,"In an ordinary resistance, the energy which is “lost” passes into heat; in this case the energy which is “lost” goes out into space."
5439,"But from the standpoint of circuit theory, without considering where the energy goes, the net effect on the circuit is the same—energy is “lost” from that circuit."
5440,"Therefore the antenna appears to the generator as having a resistance, even though it may be made with perfectly good copper."
5441,"In fact, if it is well built it will appear as almost a pure resistance, with very little inductance or capacitance, because we would like to radiate as much energy as possible out of the antenna."
5442,This resistance that an antenna shows is called the radiation resistance.
5443,"The rate at which power is radiated by the antenna is proportional to the square of the current in the antenna, of course, because all the fields are proportional to the currents, and the energy liberated is proportional to the square of the field."
5444,"An interesting question is, what is this radiation resistance due to?"
5445,Let us take a simple example: let us say that currents are driven up and down in an antenna.
5446,"We find that we have to put work in, if the antenna is to radiate energy."
5447,If we take a charged body and accelerate it up and down it radiates energy; if it were not charged it would not radiate energy.
5448,"It is one thing to calculate from the conservation of energy that energy is lost, but another thing to answer the question, against what force are we doing the work?"
5449,"That is an interesting and very difficult question which has never been completely and satisfactorily answered for electrons, although it has been for antennas."
5450,"What happens is this: in an antenna, the fields produced by the moving charges in one part of the antenna react on the moving charges in another part of the antenna."
5451,"We can calculate these forces and find out how much work they do, and so find the right rule for the radiation resistance."
5452,"When we say “We can calculate—” that is not quite right—we cannot, because we have not yet studied the laws of electricity at short distances; only at large distances do we know what the electric field is."
5453,"We saw the formula (28.3), but at present it is too complicated for us to calculate the fields inside the wave zone."
5454,"Of course, since conservation of energy is valid, we can calculate the result all right without knowing the fields at short distances."
5455,"(As a matter of fact, by using this argument backwards it turns out that one can find the formula for the forces at short distances only by knowing the field at very large distances, by using the laws of conservation of energy, but we shall not go into that here.)"
5456,"The problem in the case of a single electron is this: if there is only one charge, what can the force act on?"
5457,"It has been proposed, in the old classical theory, that the charge was a little ball, and that one part of the charge acted on the other part."
5458,"Because of the delay in the action across the tiny electron, the force is not exactly in phase with the motion."
5459,"That is, if we have the electron standing still, we know that “action equals reaction.” So the various internal forces are equal, and there is no net force."
5460,"But if the electron is accelerating, then because of the time delay across it, the force which is acting on the front from the back is not exactly the same as the force on the back from the front, because of the delay in the effect."
5461,"This delay in the timing makes for a lack of balance, so, as a net effect, the thing holds itself back by its bootstraps!"
5462,"This model of the origin of the resistance to acceleration, the radiation resistance of a moving charge, has run into many difficulties, because our present view of the electron is that it is not a “little ball”; this problem has never been solved."
5463,"Nevertheless we can calculate exactly, of course, what the net radiation resistance force must be, i.e., how much loss there must be when we accelerate a charge, in spite of not knowing directly the mechanism of how that force works."
5464,Now we shall calculate the total energy radiated by an accelerating charge.
5465,"To keep the discussion general, we shall take the case of a charge accelerating any which way, but nonrelativistically."
5466,"At a moment when the acceleration is, say, vertical, we know that the electric field that is generated is the charge multiplied by the projection of the retarded acceleration, divided by the distance."
5467,"We notice that it goes inversely as the square of the distance, as we said before."
5468,Now suppose we wanted the total energy radiated in all directions: then we must integrate (32.2) over all directions.
5469,32–1).
5470,We need the area of a spherical section.
5471,"Secondly, the flux (32.2) was calculated using the retarded acceleration; that is, the acceleration at the time at which the energy now passing through the sphere was radiated."
5472,We might like to say that this energy was in fact liberated at this earlier time.
5473,This is not exactly true; it is only an approximate idea.
5474,The exact time when the energy is liberated cannot be defined precisely.
5475,"All we can really calculate precisely is what happens in a complete motion, like an oscillation or something, where the acceleration finally ceases."
5476,"Then what we find is that the total energy flux per cycle is the average of acceleration squared, for a complete cycle."
5477,This is what should really appear in (32.5).
5478,"Or, if it is a motion with an acceleration that is initially and finally zero, then the total energy that has flown out is the time integral of (32.5)."
5479,"The formulas we are now discussing are relatively advanced and more or less modern; they date from the beginning of the twentieth century, and they are very famous."
5480,"Because of their historical value, it is important for us to be able to read about them in older books."
5481,"In fact, the older books also used a system of units different from our present mks system."
5482,"There is no oil, no resistance, in an ordinary sense; no “viscosity.” But nevertheless it will not oscillate, as we might once have said, “forever,” because if it is charged it is radiating energy, and therefore the oscillation will slowly die out."
5483,How slowly?
5484,"It has been given a name, the classical electron radius, because the early atomic models, which were invented to explain the radiation resistance on the basis of the force of one part of the electron acting on the other parts, all needed to have an electron whose dimensions were of this general order of magnitude."
5485,"However, this quantity no longer has the significance that we believe that the electron really has such a radius."
5486,"In ordinary circumstances, freely emitting atoms usually take about this long to radiate."
5487,"This is valid only for atoms which are in empty space, not being disturbed in any way."
5488,"If the electron is in a solid and it has to hit other atoms or other electrons, then there are additional resistances and different damping."
5489,23–2).
5490,Thus we have just computed the widths of spectral lines for freely radiating atoms!
5491,"In preparation for our second topic, the scattering of light, we must now discuss a certain feature of the phenomenon of interference that we neglected to discuss previously."
5492,This is the question of when interference does not occur.
5493,"That is, the combined intensity of light shining on something from two sources is the sum of the intensities of the two lights."
5494,"On the other hand, if we have things set just right and we have a cross term, it is not such a sum, because there is also some interference."
5495,"If there are circumstances in which this term is of no importance, then we would say the interference is apparently lost."
5496,"Of course, in nature it is always there, but we may not be able to detect it."
5497,Let us consider some examples.
5498,Then in a given direction it is true that there is a very definite value of these phase differences.
5499,"But, on the other hand, if we move just a hair in one direction, a few wavelengths, which is no distance at all (our eye already has a hole in it that is so large that we are averaging the effects over a range very wide compared with one wavelength) then we change the relative phase, and the cosine changes very rapidly."
5500,"If we take the average of the intensity over a little region, then the cosine, which goes plus, minus, plus, minus, as we move around, averages to zero."
5501,"So if we average over regions where the phase varies very rapidly with position, we get no interference."
5502,Another example.
5503,"Suppose that the two sources are two independent radio oscillators—not a single oscillator being fed by two wires, which guarantees that the phases are kept together, but two independent sources—and that they are not precisely tuned at the same frequency (it is very hard to make them at exactly the same frequency without actually wiring them together)."
5504,In this case we have what we call two independent sources.
5505,"Of course, since the frequencies are not exactly equal, although they started in phase, one of them begins to get a little ahead of the other, and pretty soon they are out of phase, and then it gets still further ahead, and pretty soon they are in phase again."
5506,"So the phase difference between the two is gradually drifting with time, but if our observation is so crude that we cannot see that little time, if we average over a much longer time, then although the intensity swells and falls like what we call “beats” in sound, if these swellings and fallings are too rapid for our equipment to follow, then again this term averages out."
5507,"In other words, in any circumstance in which the phase shift averages out, we get no interference!"
5508,One finds many books which say that two distinct light sources never interfere.
5509,"This is not a statement of physics, but is merely a statement of the degree of sensitivity of the technique of the experiments at the time the book was written."
5510,"But most detection equipment, of course, does not look at such fine time intervals, and thus sees no interference."
5511,"Certainly with the eye, which has a tenth-of-a-second averaging time, there is no chance whatever of seeing an interference between two different ordinary sources."
5512,Recently it has become possible to make light sources which get around this effect by making all the atoms emit together in time.
5513,"The device which does this is a very complicated thing, and has to be understood in a quantum-mechanical way."
5514,"It can be of the order of a hundredth, a tenth, or even one second, and so, with ordinary photocells, one can pick up the frequency between two different lasers."
5515,One can easily detect the pulsing of the beats between two laser sources.
5516,"Soon, no doubt, someone will be able to demonstrate two sources shining on a wall, in which the beats are so slow that one can see the wall get bright and dark!"
5517,"Another case in which the interference averages out is that in which, instead of having only two sources, we have many."
5518,"So we would get a whole lot of cosines, many plus, many minus, all averaging out."
5519,"So it is that in many circumstances we do not see the effects of interference, but see only a collective, total intensity equal to the sum of all the intensities."
5520,The above leads us to an effect which occurs in air as a consequence of the irregular positions of the atoms.
5521,"When we were discussing the index of refraction, we saw that an incoming beam of light will make the atoms radiate again."
5522,"The electric field of the incoming beam drives the electrons up and down, and they radiate because of their acceleration."
5523,"This scattered radiation combines to give a beam in the same direction as the incoming beam, but of somewhat different phase, and this is the origin of the index of refraction."
5524,But what can we say about the amount of re-radiated light in some other direction?
5525,"Ordinarily, if the atoms are very beautifully located in a nice pattern, it is easy to show that we get nothing in other directions, because we are adding a lot of vectors with their phases always changing, and the result comes to zero."
5526,"But if the objects are randomly located, then the total intensity in any direction is the sum of the intensities that are scattered by each atom, as we have just discussed."
5527,"Furthermore, the atoms in a gas are in actual motion, so that although the relative phase of two atoms is a definite amount now, later the phase would be quite different, and therefore each cosine term will average out."
5528,"Therefore, to find out how much light is scattered in a given direction by a gas, we merely study the effects of one atom and multiply the intensity it radiates by the number of atoms."
5529,"Earlier, we remarked that the phenomenon of scattering of light of this nature is the origin of the blue of the sky."
5530,32–2).
5531,From Eq.
5532,"Rather than do this, however, we shall simply calculate the total amount of light scattered in all directions, just to save time."
5533,"The total amount of light energy per second, scattered in all directions by the single atom, is of course given by Eq."
5534,(32.6).
5535,"We have written the result in the above form because it is then easy to remember: First, the total energy that is scattered is proportional to the square of the incident field."
5536,What does that mean?
5537,"Obviously, the square of the incident field is proportional to the energy which is coming in per second."
5538,"In other words, the total energy scattered is proportional to the energy per square meter that comes in; the brighter the sunlight that is shining in the sky, the brighter the sky is going to look."
5539,"Next, what fraction of the incoming light is scattered?"
5540,"Now we invent an idea: we say that the atom scatters a total amount of intensity which is the amount which would fall on a certain geometrical area, and we give the answer by giving that area."
5541,"That answer, then, is independent of the incident intensity; it gives the ratio of the energy scattered to the energy incident per square meter."
5542,"This area is called a cross section for scattering; the idea of cross section is used constantly, whenever some phenomenon occurs in proportion to the intensity of a beam."
5543,In such cases one always describes the amount of the phenomenon by saying what the effective area would have to be to pick up that much of the beam.
5544,It does not mean in any way that this oscillator actually has such an area.
5545,"If there were nothing present but a free electron shaking up and down there would be no area directly associated with it, physically."
5546,It is merely a way of expressing the answer to a certain kind of problem; it tells us what area the incident beam would have to hit in order to account for that much energy coming off.
5547,Let us look at some examples.
5548,"This low-frequency limit, or the free electron cross section, is known as the Thomson scattering cross section."
5549,"On the other hand, if we take the case of light in the air, we remember that for air the natural frequencies of the oscillators are higher than the frequency of the light that we use."
5550,"That is to say, light which is of higher frequency by, say, a factor of two, is sixteen times more intensely scattered, which is a quite sizable difference."
5551,"This means that blue light, which has about twice the frequency of the reddish end of the spectrum, is scattered to a far greater extent than red light."
5552,Thus when we look at the sky it looks that glorious blue that we see all the time!
5553,There are several points to be made about the above results.
5554,"One interesting question is, why do we ever see the clouds?"
5555,Where do the clouds come from?
5556,Everybody knows it is the condensation of water vapor.
5557,"But, of course, the water vapor is already in the atmosphere before it condenses, so why don’t we see it then?"
5558,After it condenses it is perfectly obvious.
5559,"It wasn’t there, now it is there."
5560,"So the mystery of where the clouds come from is not really such a childish mystery as “Where does the water come from, Daddy?,” but has to be explained."
5561,"We have just explained that every atom scatters light, and of course the water vapor will scatter light, too."
5562,"The mystery is why, when the water is condensed into clouds, does it scatter such a tremendously greater amount of light?"
5563,"Consider what would happen if, instead of a single atom, we had an agglomerate of atoms, say two, very close together compared with the wavelength of the light."
5564,"Then when the electric field acts, both of the atoms will move together."
5565,"The electric field that is scattered will then be the sum of the two electric fields in phase, i.e., double the amplitude that there was with a single atom, and the energy which is scattered is therefore four times what it is with a single atom, not twice!"
5566,So lumps of atoms radiate or scatter more energy than they do as single atoms.
5567,"Our argument that the phases are independent is based on the assumption that there is a real and large difference in phase between any two atoms, which is true only if they are several wavelengths apart and randomly spaced, or moving."
5568,"But if they are right next to each other, they necessarily scatter in phase, and they have a coherent interference which produces an increase in the scattering."
5569,So as the water agglomerates the scattering increases.
5570,Does it increase ad infinitum?
5571,No!
5572,When does this analysis begin to fail?
5573,How many atoms can we put together before we cannot drive this argument any further?
5574,"Answer: If the water drop gets so big that from one end to the other is a wavelength or so, then the atoms are no longer all in phase because they are too far apart."
5575,"So as we keep increasing the size of the droplets we get more and more scattering, until such a time that a drop gets about the size of a wavelength, and then the scattering does not increase anywhere nearly as rapidly as the drop gets bigger."
5576,"Furthermore, the blue disappears, because for long wavelengths the drops can be bigger, before this limit is reached, than they can be for short wavelengths."
5577,"Although the short waves scatter more per atom than the long waves, there is a bigger enhancement for the red end of the spectrum than for the blue end when all the drops are bigger than the wavelength, so the color is shifted from the blue toward the red."
5578,Now we can make an experiment that demonstrates this.
5579,"We can make particles that are very small at first, and then gradually grow in size."
5580,"We use a solution of sodium thiosulfate (hypo) with sulfuric acid, which precipitates very fine grains of sulfur."
5581,"As the sulfur precipitates, the grains first start very small, and the scattering is a little bluish."
5582,"As it precipitates more it gets more intense, and then it will get whitish as the particles get bigger."
5583,"In addition, the light which goes straight through will have the blue taken out."
5584,"That is why the sunset is red, of course, because the light that comes through a lot of air, to the eye has had a lot of blue light scattered out, so it is yellow-red."
5585,"Finally, there is one other important feature which really belongs in the next chapter, on polarization, but it is so interesting that we point it out now."
5586,This is that the electric field of the scattered light tends to vibrate in a particular direction.
5587,"The electric field in the incoming light is oscillating in some way, and the driven oscillator goes in this same direction, and if we are situated about at right angles to the beam, we will see polarized light, that is to say, light in which the electric field is going only one way."
5588,"In general, the atoms can vibrate in any direction at right angles to the beam, but if they are driven directly toward or away from us, we do not see it."
5589,(See Fig.
5590,32–3.)
5591,"There is a substance called polaroid which has the property that when light goes through it, only the piece of the electric field which is along one particular axis can get through."
5592,"We can use this to test for polarization, and indeed we find the light scattered by the hypo solution to be strongly polarized."
5593,In this chapter we shall consider those phenomena which depend on the fact that the electric field that describes the light is a vector.
5594,"In previous chapters we have not been concerned with the direction of oscillation of the electric field, except to note that the electric vector lies in a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation."
5595,The particular direction in this plane has not concerned us.
5596,We now consider those phenomena whose central feature is the particular direction of oscillation of the electric field.
5597,But the resultants shown in Fig.
5598,"If we hang a ball from a support by a long string, so that it can swing freely in a horizontal plane, it will execute sinusoidal oscillations."
5599,These motions of the ball are analogous to the oscillations of the electric field vector illustrated in Fig.
5600,33–1.
5601,The general result is that the electric vector moves around an ellipse.
5602,In Fig.
5603,33–1 and Fig.
5604,33–2 are actual electric fields that we can measure.
5605,The real and imaginary components of a complex electric field vector are only a mathematical convenience and have no physical significance.
5606,Now for some terminology.
5607,Light is linearly polarized (sometimes called plane polarized) when the electric field oscillates on a straight line; Fig.
5608,33–1 illustrates linear polarization.
5609,"When the end of the electric field vector travels in an ellipse, the light is elliptically polarized."
5610,"When the end of the electric field vector travels around a circle, we have circular polarization."
5611,"If the end of the electric vector, when we look at it as the light comes straight toward us, goes around in a counterclockwise direction, we call it right-hand circular polarization."
5612,"Figure 33–2(g) illustrates right-hand circular polarization, and Fig."
5613,33–2(c) shows left-hand circular polarization.
5614,In both cases the light is coming out of the paper.
5615,"Our convention for labeling left-hand and right-hand circular polarization is consistent with that which is used today for all the other particles in physics which exhibit polarization (e.g., electrons)."
5616,"However, in some books on optics the opposite conventions are used, so one must be careful."
5617,"We have considered linearly, circularly, and elliptically polarized light, which covers everything except for the case of unpolarized light."
5618,Now how can the light be unpolarized when we know that it must vibrate in one or another of these ellipses?
5619,"If the polarization changes more rapidly than we can detect it, then we call the light unpolarized, because all the effects of the polarization average out."
5620,None of the interference effects of polarization would show up with unpolarized light.
5621,"But as we see from the definition, light is unpolarized only if we are unable to find out whether the light is polarized or not."
5622,The first example of the polarization effect that we have already discussed is the scattering of light.
5623,"Consider a beam of light, for example from the sun, shining on the air."
5624,"The electric field will produce oscillations of charges in the air, and motion of these charges will radiate light with its maximum intensity in a plane normal to the direction of vibration of the charges."
5625,"The beam from the sun is unpolarized, so the direction of polarization changes constantly, and the direction of vibration of the charges in the air changes constantly."
5626,So scattering is an example of one means of producing polarization.
5627,Another interesting effect of polarization is the fact that there are substances for which the index of refraction is different for light linearly polarized in one direction and linearly polarized in another.
5628,"Suppose that we had some material which consisted of long, nonspherical molecules, longer than they are wide, and suppose that these molecules were arranged in the substance with their long axes parallel."
5629,Then what happens when the oscillating electric field passes through this substance?
5630,"Suppose that because of the structure of the molecule, the electrons in the substance respond more easily to oscillations in the direction parallel to the axes of the molecules than they would respond if the electric field tries to push them at right angles to the molecular axis."
5631,In this way we expect a different response for polarization in one direction than for polarization at right angles to that direction.
5632,Let us call the direction of the axes of the molecules the optic axis.
5633,When the polarization is in the direction of the optic axis the index of refraction is different than it would be if the direction of polarization were at right angles to it.
5634,Such a substance is called birefringent.
5635,"It has two refrangibilities, i.e., two indexes of refraction, depending on the direction of the polarization inside the substance."
5636,What kind of a substance can be birefringent?
5637,"In a birefringent substance there must be a certain amount of lining up, for one reason or another, of unsymmetrical molecules."
5638,"Certainly a cubic crystal, which has the symmetry of a cube, cannot be birefringent."
5639,"But long needlelike crystals undoubtedly contain molecules that are asymmetric, and one observes this effect very easily."
5640,Let us see what effects we would expect if we were to shine polarized light through a plate of a birefringent substance.
5641,"If the polarization is parallel to the optic axis, the light will go through with one velocity; if the polarization is perpendicular to the axis, the light is transmitted with a different velocity."
5642,33–2(a).
5643,As the light proceeds through the material the polarization changes as shown in the series of diagrams in Fig.
5644,33–2.
5645,"33–2(c), the light will come out circularly polarized."
5646,"If linearly polarized light is sent through two quarter-wave plates, it will come out plane-polarized again, but at right angles to the original direction, as we can see from Fig."
5647,33–2(e).
5648,One can easily illustrate this phenomenon with a piece of cellophane.
5649,"Cellophane is made of long, fibrous molecules, and is not isotropic, since the fibers lie preferentially in a certain direction."
5650,"To demonstrate birefringence we need a beam of linearly polarized light, and we can obtain this conveniently by passing unpolarized light through a sheet of polaroid."
5651,"Polaroid, which we will discuss later in more detail, has the useful property that it transmits light that is linearly polarized parallel to the axis of the polaroid with very little absorption, but light polarized in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the polaroid is strongly absorbed."
5652,"When we pass unpolarized light through a sheet of polaroid, only that part of the unpolarized beam which is vibrating parallel to the axis of the polaroid gets through, so that the transmitted beam is linearly polarized."
5653,"This same property of polaroid is also useful in detecting the direction of polarization of a linearly polarized beam, or in determining whether a beam is linearly polarized or not."
5654,One simply passes the beam of light through the polaroid sheet and rotates the polaroid in the plane normal to the beam.
5655,"If the beam is linearly polarized, it will not be transmitted through the sheet when the axis of the polaroid is normal to the direction of polarization."
5656,"If the transmitted intensity is independent of the orientation of the polaroid, the beam is not linearly polarized."
5657,"To demonstrate the birefringence of cellophane, we use two sheets of polaroid, as shown in Fig."
5658,33–3.
5659,"The first gives us a linearly polarized beam which we pass through the cellophane and then through the second polaroid sheet, which serves to detect any effect the cellophane may have had on the polarized light passing through it."
5660,"If we first set the axes of the two polaroid sheets perpendicular to each other and remove the cellophane, no light will be transmitted through the second polaroid."
5661,"If we now introduce the cellophane between the two polaroid sheets, and rotate the sheet about the beam axis, we observe that in general the cellophane makes it possible for some light to pass through the second polaroid."
5662,"However, there are two orientations of the cellophane sheet, at right angles to each other, which permit no light to pass through the second polaroid."
5663,These orientations in which linearly polarized light is transmitted through the cellophane with no effect on the direction of polarization must be the directions parallel and perpendicular to the optic axis of the cellophane sheet.
5664,"We suppose that the light passes through the cellophane with two different velocities in these two different orientations, but it is transmitted without changing the direction of polarization."
5665,"When the cellophane is turned halfway between these two orientations, as shown in Fig."
5666,"33–3, we see that the light transmitted through the second polaroid is bright."
5667,It just happens that ordinary cellophane used in commercial packaging is very close to a half-wave thickness for most of the colors in white light.
5668,"If we use white light in our demonstration, the cellophane sheet will be of the proper half-wave thickness only for a particular component of the white light, and the transmitted beam will have the color of this component."
5669,"The color transmitted depends on the thickness of the cellophane sheet, and we can vary the effective thickness of the cellophane by tilting it so that the light passes through the cellophane at an angle, consequently through a longer path in the cellophane."
5670,As the sheet is tilted the transmitted color changes.
5671,With cellophane of different thicknesses one can construct filters that will transmit different colors.
5672,"These filters have the interesting property that they transmit one color when the two polaroid sheets have their axes perpendicular, and the complementary color when the axes of the two polaroid sheets are parallel."
5673,Another interesting application of aligned molecules is quite practical.
5674,Certain plastics are composed of very long and complicated molecules all twisted together.
5675,"When the plastic is solidified very carefully, the molecules are all twisted in a mass, so that there are as many aligned in one direction as another, and so the plastic is not particularly birefringent."
5676,"Usually there are strains and stresses introduced when the material is solidified, so the material is not perfectly homogeneous."
5677,"However, if we apply tension to a piece of this plastic material, it is as if we were pulling a whole tangle of strings, and there will be more strings preferentially aligned parallel to the tension than in any other direction."
5678,"So when a stress is applied to certain plastics, they become birefringent, and one can see the effects of the birefringence by passing polarized light through the plastic."
5679,"If we examine the transmitted light through a polaroid sheet, patterns of light and dark fringes will be observed (in color, if white light is used)."
5680,"The patterns move as stress is applied to the sample, and by counting the fringes and seeing where most of them are, one can determine what the stress is."
5681,Engineers use this phenomenon as a means of finding the stresses in odd-shaped pieces that are difficult to calculate.
5682,Another interesting example of a way of obtaining birefringence is by means of a liquid substance.
5683,"Consider a liquid composed of long asymmetric molecules which carry a plus or minus average charge near the ends of the molecule, so that the molecule is an electric dipole."
5684,"In the collisions in the liquid the molecules will ordinarily be randomly oriented, with as many molecules pointed in one direction as in another."
5685,"If we apply an electric field the molecules will tend to line up, and the moment they line up the liquid becomes birefringent."
5686,"With two polaroid sheets and a transparent cell containing such a polar liquid, we can devise an arrangement with the property that light is transmitted only when the electric field is applied."
5687,"So we have an electrical switch for light, which is called a Kerr cell."
5688,"This effect, that an electric field can produce birefringence in certain liquids, is called the Kerr effect."
5689,So far we have considered substances in which the refractive index is different for light polarized in different directions.
5690,"Of very practical value are those crystals and other substances in which not only the index, but also the coefficient of absorption, is different for light polarized in different directions."
5691,"By the same arguments which supported the idea of birefringence, it is understandable that absorption can vary with the direction in which the charges are forced to vibrate in an anisotropic substance."
5692,"Tourmaline is an old, famous example and polaroid is another."
5693,"Polaroid consists of a thin layer of small crystals of herapathite (a salt of iodine and quinine), all aligned with their axes parallel."
5694,"These crystals absorb light when the oscillations are in one direction, and they do not absorb appreciably when the oscillations are in the other direction."
5695,What intensity will come through?
5696,An interesting paradox is presented by the following situation.
5697,We know that it is not possible to send a beam of light through two polaroid sheets with their axes crossed at right angles.
5698,"We know that polaroid absorbs light, it does not create anything."
5699,The analysis of this phenomenon is left as an exercise for the student.
5700,"One of the most interesting examples of polarization is not in complicated crystals or difficult substances, but in one of the simplest and most familiar of situations—the reflection of light from a surface."
5701,"Believe it or not, when light is reflected from a glass surface it may be polarized, and the physical explanation of this is very simple."
5702,It was discovered empirically by Brewster that light reflected from a surface is completely polarized if the reflected beam and the beam refracted into the material form a right angle.
5703,The situation is illustrated in Fig.
5704,33–4.
5705,"If the incident beam is polarized in the plane of incidence, there will be no reflection at all."
5706,Only if the incident beam is polarized normal to the plane of incidence will it be reflected.
5707,The reason is very easy to understand.
5708,"In the reflecting material the light is polarized transversely, and we know that it is the motion of the charges in the material which generates the emergent beam, which we call the reflected beam."
5709,"The source of this so-called reflected light is not simply that the incident beam is reflected; our deeper understanding of this phenomenon tells us that the incident beam drives an oscillation of the charges in the material, which in turn generates the reflected beam."
5710,From Fig.
5711,"33–4 it is clear that only oscillations normal to the paper can radiate in the direction of reflection, and consequently the reflected beam will be polarized normal to the plane of incidence."
5712,"If the incident beam is polarized in the plane of incidence, there will be no reflected light."
5713,This phenomenon is readily demonstrated by reflecting a linearly polarized beam from a flat piece of glass.
5714,"If the glass is turned to present different angles of incidence to the polarized beam, sharp attenuation of the reflected intensity is observed when the angle of incidence passes through Brewster’s angle."
5715,This attenuation is observed only if the plane of polarization lies in the plane of incidence.
5716,"If the plane of polarization is normal to the plane of incidence, the usual reflected intensity is observed at all angles."
5717,"Another most remarkable effect of polarization is observed in materials composed of molecules which do not have reflection symmetry: molecules shaped something like a corkscrew, or like a gloved hand, or any shape which, if viewed through a mirror, would be reversed in the same way that a left-hand glove reflects as a right-hand glove."
5718,"Suppose all of the molecules in the substance are the same, i.e., none is a mirror image of any other."
5719,"Such a substance may show an interesting effect called optical activity, whereby as linearly polarized light passes through the substance, the direction of polarization rotates about the beam axis."
5720,"To understand the phenomenon of optical activity requires some calculation, but we can see qualitatively how the effect might come about, without actually carrying out the calculations."
5721,"Consider an asymmetric molecule in the shape of a spiral, as shown in Fig."
5722,33–5.
5723,"Molecules need not actually be shaped like a corkscrew in order to exhibit optical activity, but this is a simple shape which we shall take as a typical example of those that do not have reflection symmetry."
5724,"As the light moves through the material, the direction of polarization rotates about the beam axis."
5725,"By drawing a few examples and considering the currents that will be set in motion by an incident electric field, one can convince himself that the existence of optical activity and the sign of the rotation are independent of the orientation of the molecules."
5726,Corn syrup is a common substance which possesses optical activity.
5727,"The phenomenon is easily demonstrated with a polaroid sheet to produce a linearly polarized beam, a transmission cell containing corn syrup, and a second polaroid sheet to detect the rotation of the direction of polarization as the light passes through the corn syrup."
5728,Let us now consider quantitatively the reflection coefficient as a function of angle.
5729,"Figure 33–6(a) shows a beam of light striking a glass surface, where it is partly reflected and partly refracted into the glass."
5730,"Let us suppose that the incident beam, of unit amplitude, is linearly polarized normal to the plane of the paper."
5731,"The refracted and reflected waves will, of course, be linearly polarized, and the electric field vectors of the incident, reflected, and refracted waves are all parallel to each other."
5732,"Figure 33–6(b) shows the same situation, but now we suppose that the incident wave, of unit amplitude, is polarized in the plane of the paper."
5733,We wish to calculate how strong the reflection is in the two situations illustrated in Fig.
5734,33–6(a) and 33–6(b).
5735,"We already know that when the angle between the reflected beam and refracted beam is a right angle, there will be no reflected wave in Fig."
5736,The principle that we must understand is as follows.
5737,The currents that are generated in the glass produce two waves.
5738,"First, they produce the reflected wave."
5739,"Moreover, we know that if there were no currents generated in the glass, the incident wave would continue straight into the glass."
5740,Remember that all the sources in the world make the net field.
5741,"The source of the incident light beam produces a field of unit amplitude, which would move into the glass along the dotted line in the figure."
5742,In Fig.
5743,"This is not quite true, however, because in Fig."
5744,"33–6(b) the polarization directions are not all parallel to each other, as they are in Fig."
5745,33–6(a).
5746,Now we use a trick.
5747,We know that in both (a) and (b) of Fig.
5748,"But we see from part (b) of the figure that only the component of the electric field in the glass that is normal to the dashed line has the right polarization to produce this field, whereas in Fig."
5749,Dividing Eq.
5750,(33.1) by Eq.
5751,The ratio of these two reflection coefficients is determined by Eq.
5752,(33.3).
5753,"Furthermore, the energy which passes into the glass in Fig."
5754,33–6(b) is to the energy which passes into the glass in Fig.
5755,"One might ask whether we really know how to compute the energy inside the glass, because, after all, there are energies of motion of the atoms in addition to the energy in the electric field."
5756,But it is obvious that all of the various contributions to the total energy will be proportional to the square of the amplitude of the electric field.
5757,We now substitute Eq.
5758,"To prove this, one must consider a case where light is coming from both sides of the glass surface at the same time, a situation not easy to arrange experimentally, but fun to analyze theoretically."
5759,"It is even possible to determine the sign by considering the case of a very, very thin layer in which there is reflection from the front and from the back surfaces, and calculating how much light is reflected."
5760,"We know how much light should be reflected by a thin layer, because we know how much current is generated, and we have even worked out the fields produced by such currents."
5761,"It is interesting to find out how much light is reflected at normal incidence from the surface of water, for example."
5762,"At normal incidence, only two percent of the light is reflected from the surface of water."
5763,The last polarization effect we shall consider was actually one of the first to be discovered: anomalous refraction.
5764,"This came to the attention of Huygens, and played an important role in the discovery of polarization."
5765,"As is often the case, the phenomena which are discovered first are the hardest, ultimately, to explain."
5766,It is only after we understand a physical concept thoroughly that we can carefully select those phenomena which most clearly and simply demonstrate the concept.
5767,Anomalous refraction is a particular case of the same birefringence that we considered earlier.
5768,"Anomalous refraction comes about when the optic axis, the long axis of our asymmetric molecules, is not parallel to the surface of the crystal."
5769,In Fig.
5770,"33–7 are drawn two pieces of birefringent material, with the optic axis as shown."
5771,"In part (a) of the figure, the incident beam falling on the material is linearly polarized in a direction perpendicular to the optic axis of the material."
5772,"The wavefront is just the envelope or locus of all these little spherical waves, and this wavefront moves straight through the crystal and out the other side."
5773,"This is just the ordinary behavior we would expect, and this ray is called the ordinary ray."
5774,"When we now consider the little waves originating at any point on the surface of the crystal, we see that they do not spread out as spherical waves."
5775,"A more complete analysis will show that the waves spread out on the surface of an ellipsoid, with the optic axis as major axis of the ellipsoid."
5776,The envelope of all these elliptical waves is the wavefront which proceeds through the crystal in the direction shown.
5777,"Again, at the back surface the beam will be deflected just as it was at the front surface, so that the light emerges parallel to the incident beam, but displaced from it."
5778,"Clearly, this beam does not follow Snell’s law, but goes in an extraordinary direction."
5779,It is therefore called the extraordinary ray.
5780,"When an unpolarized beam strikes an anomalously refracting crystal, it is separated into an ordinary ray, which travels straight through in the normal manner, and an extraordinary ray which is displaced as it passes through the crystal."
5781,These two emergent rays are linearly polarized at right angles to each other.
5782,That this is true can be readily demonstrated with a sheet of polaroid to analyze the polarization of the emergent rays.
5783,We can also demonstrate that our interpretation of this phenomenon is correct by sending linearly polarized light into the crystal.
5784,"By properly orienting the direction of polarization of the incident beam, we can make this light go straight through without splitting, or we can make it go through without splitting but with a displacement."
5785,We have represented all the various polarization cases in Figs.
5786,Other pairs could equally well have been used.
5787,33–2].
5788,"It is interesting, however, that this idea can be extended to other cases also."
5789,"For example, any linear polarization can be made up by superposing suitable amounts at suitable phases of right and left circular polarizations [cases (c) and (g) of Fig."
5790,"33–2], since two equal vectors rotating in opposite directions add to give a single vector oscillating in a straight line (Fig."
5791,33–8).
5792,"If the phase of one is shifted relative to the other, the line is inclined."
5793,Thus all the pictures of Fig.
5794,"33–1 could be labeled “the superposition of equal amounts of right and left circularly polarized light at various relative phases.” As the left slips behind the right in phase, the direction of the linear polarization changes."
5795,"Therefore optically active materials are, in a sense, birefringent."
5796,Their properties can be described by saying that they have different indexes for right- and left-hand circularly polarized light.
5797,Superposition of right and left circularly polarized light of different intensities produces elliptically polarized light.
5798,Circularly polarized light has another interesting property—it carries angular momentum (about the direction of propagation).
5799,33–9).
5800,For when this beam is absorbed that angular momentum is delivered to the absorber.
5801,"In the present chapter we shall describe a number of miscellaneous effects in connection with radiation, and then we shall be finished with the classical theory of light propagation."
5802,"In our analysis of light, we have gone rather far and into considerable detail."
5803,"The only phenomena of any consequence associated with electromagnetic radiation that we have not discussed is what happens if radiowaves are contained in a box with reflecting walls, the size of the box being comparable to a wavelength, or are transmitted down a long tube."
5804,The phenomena of so-called cavity resonators and waveguides we shall discuss later; we shall first use another physical example—sound—and then we shall return to this subject.
5805,"Except for this, the present chapter is our last consideration of the classical theory of light."
5806,We can summarize all the effects that we shall now discuss by remarking that they have to do with the effects of moving sources.
5807,"We no longer assume that the source is localized, with all its motion being at a relatively low speed near a fixed point."
5808,"Until now we have considered only the case in which motions are nonrelativistic in speed, so that there is no appreciable motion in the direction of the source to be considered."
5809,"Now we shall be more general and study the case where the motion is at an arbitrary velocity, and see what different effects may be expected in those circumstances."
5810,"We shall let the motion be at an arbitrary speed, but of course we shall still assume that the detector is very far from the source."
5811,34–1).
5812,"Of course, we realize that the coordinates must be measured at the retarded time."
5813,What time is the retarded time?
5814,"This is an effect that we have neglected before, and it is the only change needed in order to make our results valid for all speeds."
5815,"This picture will give us a good qualitative feeling for how things work, but it still takes a lot of detailed mathematics to deduce the precise results of a complicated problem."
5816,The above equation has an interesting simplification.
5817,What that turns out to mean is shown in Fig.
5818,34–2.
5819,"(The figure shows the result for a rather complicated motion in a plane, but of course the motion may not be in one plane—it may be even more complicated than motion in a plane.)"
5820,"All we have to do to find the field is to look at the acceleration of this curve, i.e., to differentiate it twice."
5821,The acceleration of this point makes the electric field.
5822,This solution is just as exact as the formula we started with—it is simply a geometrical representation.
5823,"If the motion is relatively slow, for instance if we have an oscillator just going up and down slowly, then when we shoot that motion away at the speed of light, we would get, of course, a simple cosine curve, and that gives a formula we have been looking at for a long time: it gives the field produced by an oscillating charge."
5824,"A more interesting example is an electron moving rapidly, very nearly at the speed of light, in a circle."
5825,34–3.
5826,What is this curve?
5827,"If we imagine a radius vector from the center of the circle to the charge, and if we extend this radial line a little bit past the charge, just a shade if it is going fast, then we come to a point on the line that goes at the speed of light."
5828,"If the charge is going very nearly at the speed of light, the “cusps” are very sharp indeed; if it went at exactly the speed of light, they would be actual cusps, infinitely sharp."
5829,“Infinitely sharp” is interesting; it means that near a cusp the second derivative is enormous.
5830,Once in each cycle we get a sharp pulse of electric field.
5831,"This is not at all what we would get from a nonrelativistic motion, where each time the charge goes around there is an oscillation which is of about the same “strength” all the time."
5832,These strong electric fields are emitted in a narrow cone in the direction of motion of the charge.
5833,Let us discuss this in more detail.
5834,In the synchrotron we have electrons which go around in circles in a uniform magnetic field.
5835,"First, let us see why they go in circles."
5836,From Eq.
5837,"As usual, the force is equal to the rate of change of momentum with time."
5838,"If the field is directed upward out of the paper, the momentum of the particle and the force on it are as shown in Fig."
5839,34–4.
5840,"Since the force is at right angles to the velocity, the kinetic energy, and therefore the speed, remains constant."
5841,All the magnetic field does is to change the direction of motion.
5842,The result that the momentum of the particle is equal to a charge times the radius times the magnetic field is a very important law that is used a great deal.
5843,"It is important for practical purposes because if we have elementary particles which all have the same charge and we observe them in a magnetic field, we can measure the radii of curvature of their orbits and, knowing the magnetic field, thus determine the momenta of the particles."
5844,If we multiply both sides of Eq.
5845,The mks unit of magnetic field is called a weber per square meter.
5846,"There is an older unit which is still in common use, called a gauss."
5847,The field of the earth is a few tenths of a gauss at the equator.
5848,Returning to Eq.
5849,(We shall come back to the energy in just a moment.)
5850,So now we have a feeling for why the synchrotron has the size it has.
5851,We turn now to the radiation emitted by such a particle.
5852,But because of the piling up effect that we have been discussing (Fig.
5853,"(Actually, the cusp itself is not the entire determining factor; one must also include a certain region about the cusp."
5854,"Clearly, the light should be polarized, with the electric field perpendicular to the uniform magnetic field."
5855,"To further appreciate what we would observe, suppose that we were to take such light (to simplify things, because these pulses are so far apart in time, we shall just take one pulse) and direct it onto a diffraction grating, which is a lot of scattering wires."
5856,"After this pulse comes away from the grating, what do we see?"
5857,"(We should see red light, blue light, and so on, if we see any light at all.)"
5858,What do we see?
5859,"The pulse strikes the grating head-on, and all the oscillators in the grating, together, are violently moved up and then back down again, just once."
5860,"They then produce effects in various directions, as shown in Fig."
5861,34–5.
5862,"In short, the sum of the reflections from all the successive wires is as shown in Fig."
5863,"34–6(a); it is an electric field which is a series of pulses, and it is very like a sine wave whose wavelength is the distance between the pulses, just as it would be for monochromatic light striking the grating!"
5864,"So, we get colored light all right."
5865,"But, by the same argument, will we not get light from any kind of a “pulse”?"
5866,No.
5867,"Suppose that the curve were much smoother; then we would add all the scattered waves together, separated by a small time between them (Fig."
5868,34–6b).
5869,"Then we see that the field would not shake at all, it would be a very smooth curve, because each pulse does not vary much in the time interval between pulses."
5870,The electromagnetic radiation emitted by relativistic charged particles circulating in a magnetic field is called synchrotron radiation.
5871,"It is so named for obvious reasons, but it is not limited specifically to synchrotrons, or even to earthbound laboratories."
5872,It is exciting and interesting that it also occurs in nature!
5873,"In the year 1054 the Chinese and Japanese civilizations were among the most advanced in the world; they were conscious of the external universe, and they recorded, most remarkably, an explosive bright star in that year."
5874,"(It is amazing that none of the European monks, writing all the books of the middle ages, even bothered to write that a star exploded in the sky, but they did not.)"
5875,"Today we may take a picture of that star, and what we see is shown in Fig."
5876,34–7.
5877,"On the outside is a big mass of red filaments, which is produced by the atoms of the thin gas “ringing” at their natural frequencies; this makes a bright line spectrum with different frequencies in it."
5878,The red happens in this case to be due to nitrogen.
5879,"On the other hand, in the central region is a mysterious, fuzzy patch of light in a continuous distribution of frequency, i.e., there are no special frequencies associated with particular atoms."
5880,"Yet this is not dust “lit up” by nearby stars, which is one way by which one can get a continuous spectrum."
5881,"We can see stars through it, so it is transparent, but it is emitting light."
5882,In Fig.
5883,"34–8 we look at the same object, using light in a region of the spectrum which has no bright spectral line, so that we see only the central region."
5884,We see that the pictures are different!
5885,"That is to say, the light is polarized."
5886,"The reason, presumably, is that there is a local magnetic field, and many very energetic electrons are going around in that magnetic field."
5887,We have just illustrated how the electrons could go around the field in a circle.
5888,"Putting these two facts together, we see that in a region where one picture is bright and the other one is black, the light must have its electric field completely polarized in one direction."
5889,"This means that there is a magnetic field at right angles to this direction, while in other regions, where there is a strong emission in the other picture, the magnetic field must be the other way."
5890,If we look carefully at Fig.
5891,"34–8, we may notice that there is, roughly speaking, a general set of “lines” that go one way in one picture and at right angles to this in the other."
5892,The pictures show a kind of fibrous structure.
5893,"Presumably, the magnetic field lines will tend to extend relatively long distances in their own direction, and so, presumably, there are long regions of magnetic field with all the electrons spiralling one way, while in another region the field is the other way and the electrons are also spiralling that way."
5894,What keeps the electron energy so high for so long a time?
5895,How they maintain their energy and how this whole thing keeps going is still not thoroughly understood.
5896,We shall next remark briefly on one other interesting effect of a very fast-moving particle that radiates energy.
5897,The idea is very similar to the one we have just discussed.
5898,"Suppose that there are charged particles in a piece of matter and a very fast electron, say, comes by (Fig."
5899,34–9).
5900,"Then, because of the electric field around the atomic nucleus the electron is pulled, accelerated, so that the curve of its motion has a slight kink or bend in it."
5901,So when very energetic electrons move through matter they spit radiation in a forward direction.
5902,This is called bremsstrahlung.
5903,"As a matter of fact, the synchrotron is used, not so much to make high-energy electrons (actually if we could get them out of the machine more conveniently we would not say this) as to make very energetic photons—gamma rays—by passing the energetic electrons through a solid tungsten “target,” and letting them radiate photons from this bremsstrahlung effect."
5904,Now we go on to consider some other examples of the effects of moving sources.
5905,"Then the actual motion in space, of course, is as shown in Fig."
5906,34–10(a).
5907,34–10(b).
5908,"We can, of course, analyze this situation in various other ways."
5909,At what frequency would they be received by us?
5910,"The first one that arrives has a certain delay, but the next one is delayed less because in the meantime the atom moves closer to the receiver."
5911,"Therefore, the time between the “pips” is decreased by the motion."
5912,"The shift in frequency observed in the above situation is called the Doppler effect: if something moves toward us the light it emits appears more violet, and if it moves away it appears more red."
5913,We shall now give two more derivations of this same interesting and important result.
5914,How many radians of phase will he have seen go by?
5915,We have made this analysis from the point of view of a man at rest; we would like to know how it would look to the man who is moving.
5916,Is the frequency that we would observe if we move toward a source different than the frequency that we would see if the source moved toward us?
5917,Of course not!
5918,The theory of relativity says that these two must be exactly equal.
5919,If we were expert enough mathematicians we would probably recognize that these two mathematical expressions are exactly equal!
5920,"In fact, the necessary equality of the two expressions is one of the ways by which some people like to demonstrate that relativity requires a time dilation, because if we did not put those square-root factors in, they would no longer be equal."
5921,"Since we know about relativity, let us analyze it in still a third way, which may appear a little more general."
5922,"(It is really the same thing, since it makes no difference how we do it!)"
5923,According to the relativity theory there is a relationship between position and time as observed by one man and position and time as seen by another who is moving relative to him.
5924,We wrote down those relationships long ago (Chapter 16).
5925,"But what would a man in motion, observing the same physical wave, see?"
5926,"Where the field is zero, the positions of all the nodes are the same (when the field is zero, everyone measures the field as zero); that is a relativistic invariant."
5927,The relationships indicated in Eqs.
5928,"They constitute what we call a four-vector; when a quantity has four components transforming like time and space, it is a four-vector."
5929,"Everything seems all right, then, except for one little thing: we said that a four-vector has to have four components; where are the other two components?"
5930,34–11.
5931,What is the formula for such a wave?
5932,Referring to Fig.
5933,"That, then, is the nature of the wave vector that we use to represent a wave in three dimensions."
5934,"In our previous discussion of special relativity (Chapter 17), we learned that there are ways of making relativistic dot products with four-vectors."
5935,"This dot product is an invariant, independent of the coordinate system; what is it equal to?"
5936,"But this quantity is precisely what appears inside the cosine for a plane wave, and it ought to be invariant under a Lorentz transformation."
5937,"We cannot have a formula with something that changes inside the cosine, since we know that the phase of the wave cannot change when we change the coordinate system."
5938,In deriving Eqs.
5939,"For example, suppose there is a source sending out light in a certain direction from the point of view of a man at rest, but we are moving along on the earth, say (Fig."
5940,34–12).
5941,From which direction does the light appear to come?
5942,"The answer, however, can be found by the following argument: we have to point our telescope at an angle to see the light."
5943,Why?
5944,How nice!
5945,"This effect, that a telescope has to be tilted, is called aberration, and it has been observed."
5946,How can we observe it?
5947,Who can say where a given star should be?
5948,Suppose we do have to look in the wrong direction to see a star; how do we know it is the wrong direction?
5949,Because the earth goes around the sun.
5950,Today we have to point the telescope one way; six months later we have to tilt the telescope the other way.
5951,That is how we can tell that there is such an effect.
5952,Now we turn to a different topic.
5953,"We have never, in all our discussion of the past few chapters, said anything about the effects of the magnetic field that is associated with light."
5954,"Ordinarily, the effects of the magnetic field are very small, but there is one interesting and important effect which is a consequence of the magnetic field."
5955,Suppose that light is coming from a source and is acting on a charge and driving that charge up and down.
5956,34–13.
5957,The magnetic field is at right angles to the electric field.
5958,"Now as the electric field acts on the charge and moves it up and down, what does the magnetic field do?"
5959,It is in the direction of the propagation of light.
5960,"Therefore, when light is shining on a charge and it is oscillating in response to that light, there is a driving force in the direction of the light beam."
5961,This is called radiation pressure or light pressure.
5962,Let us determine how strong the radiation pressure is.
5963,"That is a general rule, since we did not say how strong the oscillator was, or whether some of the charges cancel out."
5964,"In any circumstance where light is being absorbed, there is a pressure."
5965,That light carries energy we already know.
5966,When light is emitted from a source there is a recoil effect: the same thing in reverse.
5967,"If light is reflected normally from a mirror, we get twice the force."
5968,That is as far as we shall go using the classical theory of light.
5969,"Of course we know that there is a quantum theory, and that in many respects light acts like a particle."
5970,Therefore it is a good thing that (34.27) has the same constant in both cases; it means that the quantum theory and the theory of relativity are mutually consistent.
5971,That is what becomes of polarization in the corpuscular point of view—the photons carry angular momentum like spinning rifle bullets.
5972,"But this “bullet” picture is really as incomplete as the “wave” picture, and we shall have to discuss these ideas more fully in a later chapter on Quantum Behavior."
5973,(There was no summary for this lecture.)
5974,The phenomenon of colors depends partly on the physical world.
5975,We discuss the colors of soap films and so on as being produced by interference.
5976,"But also, of course, it depends on the eye, or what happens behind the eye, in the brain."
5977,"Physics characterizes the light that enters the eye, but after that, our sensations are the result of photochemical-neural processes and psychological responses."
5978,"There are many interesting phenomena associated with vision which involve a mixture of physical phenomena and physiological processes, and the full appreciation of natural phenomena, as we see them, must go beyond physics in the usual sense."
5979,"We make no apologies for making these excursions into other fields, because the separation of fields, as we have emphasized, is merely a human convenience, and an unnatural thing."
5980,"Nature is not interested in our separations, and many of the interesting phenomena bridge the gaps between fields."
5981,"In Chapter 3 we have already discussed the relation of physics to the other sciences in general terms, but now we are going to look in some detail at a specific field in which physics and other sciences are very, very closely interrelated."
5982,That area is vision.
5983,"In particular, we shall discuss color vision."
5984,"In the present chapter we shall discuss mainly the observable phenomena of human vision, and in the next chapter we shall consider the physiological aspects of vision, both in man and in other animals."
5985,"It all begins with the eye; so, in order to understand what phenomena we see, some knowledge of the eye is required."
5986,"In the next chapter we shall discuss in some detail how the various parts of the eye work, and how they are interconnected with the nervous system."
5987,"For the present, we shall describe only briefly how the eye functions (Fig."
5988,35–1).
5989,"Light enters the eye through the cornea; we have already discussed how it is bent and is imaged on a layer called the retina in the back of the eye, so that different parts of the retina receive light from different parts of the visual field outside."
5990,"The retina is not absolutely uniform: there is a place, a spot, in the center of our field of view which we use when we are trying to see things very carefully, and at which we have the greatest acuity of vision; it is called the fovea or macula."
5991,"The side parts of the eye, as we can immediately appreciate from our experience in looking at things, are not as effective for seeing detail as is the center of the eye."
5992,There is also a spot in the retina where the nerves carrying all the information run out; that is a blind spot.
5993,"There is no sensitive part of the retina here, and it is possible to demonstrate that if we close, say, the left eye and look straight at something, and then move a finger or another small object slowly out of the field of view it suddenly disappears somewhere."
5994,"The only practical use of this fact that we know of is that some physiologist became quite a favorite in the court of a king of France by pointing this out to him; in the boring sessions that he had with his courtiers, the king could amuse himself by “cutting off their heads” by looking at one and watching another’s head disappear."
5995,Figure 35–2 shows a magnified view of the inside of the retina in somewhat schematic form.
5996,In different parts of the retina there are different kinds of structures.
5997,The objects that occur more densely near the periphery of the retina are called rods.
5998,"Closer to the fovea, we find, besides these rod cells, also cone cells."
5999,We shall describe the structure of these cells later.
6000,"As we get close to the fovea, the number of cones increases, and in the fovea itself there are in fact nothing but cone cells, packed very tightly, so tightly that the cone cells are much finer, or narrower here than anywhere else."
6001,"So we must appreciate that we see with the cones right in the middle of the field of view, but as we go to the periphery we have the other cells, the rods."
6002,"Now the interesting thing is that in the retina each of the cells which is sensitive to light is not connected by a fiber directly to the optic nerve, but is connected to many other cells, which are themselves connected to each other."
6003,"There are several kinds of cells: there are cells that carry the information toward the optic nerve, but there are others that are mainly interconnected “horizontally.” There are essentially four kinds of cells, but we shall not go into these details now."
6004,"The main thing we emphasize is that the light signal is already being “thought about.” That is to say, the information from the various cells does not immediately go to the brain, spot for spot, but in the retina a certain amount of the information has already been digested, by a combining of the information from several visual receptors."
6005,It is important to understand that some brain-function phenomena occur in the eye itself.
6006,One of the most striking phenomena of vision is the dark adaptation of the eye.
6007,"If we go into the dark from a brightly lighted room, we cannot see very well for a while, but gradually things become more and more apparent, and eventually we can see something where we could see nothing before."
6008,"If the intensity of the light is very low, the things that we see have no color."
6009,"It is known that this dark-adapted vision is almost entirely due to the rods, while the vision in bright light is due to the cones."
6010,"As a result, there are a number of phenomena that we can easily appreciate because of this transfer of function from the cones and rods together, to just the rods."
6011,"There are many situations in which, if the light intensity were stronger, we could see color, and we would find these things quite beautiful."
6012,"One example is that through a telescope we nearly always see “black and white” images of faint nebulae, but W. C. Miller of the Mt."
6013,Wilson and Palomar Observatories had the patience to make color pictures of some of these objects.
6014,"Nobody has ever really seen these colors with the eye, but they are not artificial colors, it is merely that the light intensity is not strong enough for the cones in our eye to see them."
6015,Among the more spectacular such objects are the ring nebula and the Crab nebula.
6016,"The former shows a beautiful blue inner part, with a bright red outer halo, and the latter shows a general bluish haze permeated by bright red-orange filaments."
6017,"In the bright light, apparently, the rods are at very low sensitivity but, in the dark, as time goes on they pick up their ability to see light."
6018,The variations in light intensity for which one can adapt is over a million to one.
6019,"Nature does not do all this with just one kind of cell, but she passes her job from bright-light-seeing cells, the color-seeing cells, the cones, to low-intensity, dark-adapted cells, the rods."
6020,"Among the interesting consequences of this shift is, first, that there is no color, and second, that there is a difference in the relative brightness of differently colored objects."
6021,"It turns out that the rods see better toward the blue than the cones do, and the cones can see, for example, deep red light, while the rods find that absolutely impossible to see."
6022,So red light is black so far as the rods are concerned.
6023,"Thus two pieces of colored paper, say blue and red, in which the red might be even brighter than the blue in good light, will, in the dark, appear completely reversed."
6024,It is a very striking effect.
6025,"If we are in the dark and can find a magazine or something that has colors and, before we know for sure what the colors are, we judge the lighter and darker areas, and if we then carry the magazine into the light, we may see this very remarkable shift between which was the brightest color and which was not."
6026,The phenomenon is called the Purkinje effect.
6027,In Fig.
6028,"35–3, the dashed curve represents the sensitivity of the eye in the dark, i.e., using the rods, while the solid curve represents it in the light."
6029,We see that the peak sensitivity of the rods is in the green region and that of the cones is more in the yellow region.
6030,"Another effect of the fact that rods take over in the dark, and that there are no rods in the fovea, is that when we look straight at something in the dark, our vision is not quite as acute as when we look to one side."
6031,"A faint star or nebula can sometimes be seen better by looking a little to one side than directly at it, because we do not have sensitive rods in the middle of the fovea."
6032,Another interesting effect of the fact that the number of cones decreases as we go farther to the side of the field of view is that even in a bright light color disappears as the object goes far to one side.
6033,"The way to test that is to look in some particular fixed direction, let a friend walk in from one side with colored cards, and try to decide what color they are before they are right in front of you."
6034,One finds that he can see that the cards are there long before he can determine the color.
6035,"When doing this, it is advisable to come in from the side opposite the blind spot, because it is otherwise rather confusing to almost see the color, then not see anything, then to see the color again."
6036,Another interesting phenomenon is that the periphery of the retina is very sensitive to motion.
6037,"Although we cannot see very well from the corner of our eye, if a little bug moves and we do not expect anything to be moving over there, we are immediately sensitive to it."
6038,We are all “wired up” to look for something jiggling to the side of the field.
6039,"Now we go to the cone vision, to the brighter vision, and we come to the question which is most characteristic of cone vision, and that is color."
6040,"As we know, white light can be split by a prism into a whole spectrum of wavelengths which appear to us to have different colors; that is what colors are, of course: appearances."
6041,"Any source of light can be analyzed by a grating or a prism, and one can determine the spectral distribution, i.e., the “amount” of each wavelength."
6042,"A certain light may have a lot of blue, considerable red, very little yellow, and so on."
6043,"That is all very precise in the sense of physics, but the question is, what color will it appear to be?"
6044,"It is evident that the different colors depend somehow upon the spectral distribution of the light, but the problem is to find what characteristics of the spectral distribution produce the various sensations."
6045,"For example, what do we have to do to get a green color?"
6046,We all know that we can simply take a piece of the spectrum which is green.
6047,"But is that the only way to get green, or orange, or any other color?"
6048,Is there more than one spectral distribution which produces the same apparent visual effect?
6049,"The answer is, definitely yes."
6050,"There is a very limited number of visual effects, in fact just a three-dimensional manifold of them, as we shall shortly see, but there is an infinite number of different curves that we can draw for the light that comes from different sources."
6051,"Now the question we have to discuss is, under what conditions do different distributions of light appear as exactly the same color to the eye?"
6052,The most powerful psycho-physical technique in color judgment is to use the eye as a null instrument.
6053,"That is, we do not try to define what constitutes a green sensation, or to measure in what circumstances we get a green sensation, because it turns out that this is extremely complicated."
6054,"Instead, we study the conditions under which two stimuli are indistinguishable."
6055,"Then we do not have to decide whether two people see the same sensation in different circumstances, but only whether, if for one person two sensations are the same, they are also the same for another."
6056,"We do not have to decide whether, when one sees something green, what it feels like inside is the same as what it feels like inside someone else when he sees something green; we do not know anything about that."
6057,"To illustrate the possibilities, we may use a series of four projector lamps which have filters on them, and whose brightnesses are continuously adjustable over a wide range: one has a red filter and makes a spot of red light on the screen, the next one has a green filter and makes a green spot, the third one has a blue filter, and the fourth one is a white circle with a black spot in the middle of it."
6058,"Now if we turn on some red light, and next to it put some green, we see that in the area of overlap it produces a sensation which is not what we call reddish green, but a new color, yellow in this particular case."
6059,"By changing the proportions of the red and the green, we can go through various shades of orange and so forth."
6060,"If we have set it for a certain yellow, we can also obtain that same yellow, not by mixing these two colors but by mixing some other ones, perhaps a yellow filter with white light, or something like that, to get the same sensation."
6061,"In other words, it is possible to make various colors in more than one way by mixing the lights from various filters."
6062,What we have just discovered may be expressed analytically as follows.
6063,Let us see what can be done in that connection.
6064,"We certainly cannot get all the different colors by mixing only red and green, because, for instance, blue never appears in such a mixture."
6065,"However, by putting in some blue the central region, where all three spots overlap, may be made to appear to be a fairly nice white."
6066,"By mixing the various colors and looking at this central region, we find that we can get a considerable range of colors in that region by changing the proportions, and so it is not impossible that all the colors can be made by mixing these three colored lights."
6067,"We shall discuss to what extent this is true; it is in fact essentially correct, and we shall shortly see how to define the proposition better."
6068,"In order to illustrate our point, we move the spots on the screen so that they all fall on top of each other, and then we try to match a particular color which appears in the annular ring made by the fourth lamp."
6069,What we once thought was “white” coming from the fourth lamp now appears yellowish.
6070,"We may try to match that by adjusting the red and green and blue as best we can by a kind of trial and error, and we find that we can approach rather closely this particular shade of “cream” color."
6071,So it is not hard to believe that we can make all colors.
6072,"We shall try to make yellow in a moment, but before we do that, there is one color that might be very hard to make."
6073,"People who give lectures on color make all the “bright” colors, but they never make brown, and it is hard to recall ever having seen brown light."
6074,"As a matter of fact, this color is never used for any stage effect, one never sees a spotlight with brown light; so we think it might be impossible to make brown."
6075,"In order to find out whether it is possible to make brown, we point out that brown light is merely something that we are not used to seeing without its background."
6076,"As a matter of fact, we can make it by mixing some red and yellow."
6077,"To prove that we are looking at brown light, we merely increase the brightness of the annular background against which we see the very same light, and we see that that is, in fact, what we call brown!"
6078,Brown is always a dark color next to a lighter background.
6079,We can easily change the character of the brown.
6080,"For example, if we take some green out we get a reddish brown, apparently a chocolaty reddish brown, and if we put more green into it, in proportion, we get that horrible color which all the uniforms of the Army are made of, but the light from that color is not so horrible by itself; it is of yellowish green, but seen against a light background."
6081,Now we put a yellow filter in front of the fourth light and try to match that.
6082,"(The intensity must of course be within the range of the various lamps; we cannot match something which is too bright, because we do not have enough power in the lamp.)"
6083,"But we can match the yellow; we use a green and red mixture, and put in a touch of blue to make it even more perfect."
6084,"Perhaps we are ready to believe that, under good conditions, we can make a perfect match of any given color."
6085,Now let us discuss the laws of color mixture.
6086,"In the first place, we found that different spectral distributions can produce the same color; next, we saw that “any” color can be made by adding together three special colors, red, blue, and green."
6087,So adding any other light to the matched lights leaves a match.
6088,"In other words, we can summarize all these color phenomena by saying that once we have a match between two colored lights, seen next to each other in the same circumstances, then this match will remain, and one light can be substituted for the other light in any other color mixing situation."
6089,"In fact, it turns out, and it is very important and interesting, that this matching of the color of lights is not dependent upon the characteristics of the eye at the moment of observation: we know that if we look for a long time at a bright red surface, or a bright red light, and then look at a white paper, it looks greenish, and other colors are also distorted by our having looked so long at the bright red."
6090,"If we now have a match between, say, two yellows, and we look at them and make them match, then we look at a bright red surface for a long time, and then turn back to the yellow, it may not look yellow any more; I do not know what color it will look, but it will not look yellow."
6091,"Nevertheless the yellows will still look matched, and so, as the eye adapts to various levels of intensity, the color match still works, with the obvious exception of when we go into the region where the intensity of the light gets so low that we have shifted from cones to rods; then the color match is no longer a color match, because we are using a different system."
6092,"The second principle of color mixing of lights is this: any color at all can be made from three different colors, in our case, red, green, and blue lights."
6093,"By suitably mixing the three together we can make anything at all, as we demonstrated with our two examples."
6094,"Further, these laws are very interesting mathematically."
6095,"For those who are interested in the mathematics of the thing, it turns out as follows."
6096,This subject has always appealed to physicists and mathematicians.
6097,"In fact, Schrödinger wrote a wonderful paper on color vision in which he developed this theory of vector analysis as applied to the mixing of colors.1"
6098,"Now a question is, what are the correct primary colors to use?"
6099,There is no such thing as “the” correct primary colors for the mixing of lights.
6100,"There may be, for practical purposes, three paints that are more useful than others for getting a greater variety of mixed pigments, but we are not discussing that matter now."
6101,Any three differently colored lights whatsoever2 can always be mixed in the correct proportion to produce any color whatsoever.
6102,Can we demonstrate this fantastic fact?
6103,"Instead of using red, green, and blue, let us use red, blue, and yellow in our projector."
6104,"Can we use red, blue, and yellow to make, say, green?"
6105,"By mixing these three colors in various proportions, we get quite an array of different colors, ranging over quite a spectrum."
6106,"But as a matter of fact, after a lot of trial and error, we find that nothing ever looks like green."
6107,"The question is, can we make green?"
6108,The answer is yes.
6109,How?
6110,"By projecting some red onto the green, then we can make a match with a certain mixture of yellow and blue!"
6111,"So we have matched them, except that we had to cheat by putting the red on the other side."
6112,"Putting it on the other side of the equation, we can interpret that as a negative amount, so if we will allow that the coefficients in equations like (35.4) can be both positive and negative, and if we interpret negative amounts to mean that we have to add those to the other side, then any color can be matched by any three, and there is no such thing as “the” fundamental primaries."
6113,We may ask whether there are three colors that come only with positive amounts for all mixings.
6114,The answer is no.
6115,"Every set of three primaries requires negative amounts for some colors, and therefore there is no unique way to define a primary."
6116,"In elementary books they are said to be red, green, and blue, but that is merely because with these a wider range of colors is available without minus signs for some of the combinations."
6117,Now let us discuss the combination of colors on a mathematical level as a geometrical proposition.
6118,If any one color is represented by Eq.
6119,"The sum of the two, as we know, is the color which comes from adding these as vectors."
6120,"So if we agree to reduce everything to the same light intensity, then we can project everything onto a plane, and this has been done in Fig."
6121,35–4.
6122,It follows that any color obtained by mixing a given two in some proportion will lie somewhere on a line drawn between the two points.
6123,"If we use a blue and a green and a red, as primaries, we see that all the colors that we can make with positive coefficients are inside the dotted triangle, which contains almost all of the colors that we can ever see, because all the colors that we can ever see are enclosed in the oddly shaped area bounded by the curve."
6124,Where did this area come from?
6125,Once somebody made a very careful match of all the colors that we can see against three special ones.
6126,"But we do not have to check all colors that we can see, we only have to check the pure spectral colors, the lines of the spectrum."
6127,Any light can be considered as a sum of various positive amounts of various pure spectral colors—pure from the physical standpoint.
6128,"A given light will have a certain amount of red, yellow, blue, and so on—spectral colors."
6129,"So if we know how much of each of our three chosen primaries is needed to make each of these pure components, we can calculate how much of each is needed to make our given color."
6130,"So, if we find out what the color coefficients of all the spectral colors are for any given three primary colors, then we can work out the whole color mixing table."
6131,An example of such experimental results for mixing three lights together is given in Fig.
6132,35–5.
6133,"This figure shows the amount of each of three different particular primaries, red, green and blue, which is required to make each of the spectral colors."
6134,"Red is at the left end of the spectrum, yellow is next, and so on, all the way to blue."
6135,Notice that at some points minus signs are necessary.
6136,That is the way that the curved boundary line has been found.
6137,It is the locus of the pure spectral colors.
6138,"Now any other color can be made by adding spectral lines, of course, and so we find that anything that can be produced by connecting one part of this curve to another is a color that is available in nature."
6139,The straight line connects the extreme violet end of the spectrum with the extreme red end.
6140,It is the locus of the purples.
6141,"Inside the boundary are colors that can be made with lights, and outside it are colors that cannot be made with lights, and nobody has ever seen them (except, possibly, in after-images!"
6142,).
6143,"Now the next aspect of the matter is the question, why do colors behave in this way?"
6144,"The simplest theory, proposed by Young and Helmholtz, supposes that in the eye there are three different pigments which receive the light and that these have different absorption spectra, so that one pigment absorbs strongly, say, in the red, another absorbs strongly in the blue, another absorbs in the green."
6145,"Then when we shine a light on them we will get different amounts of absorptions in the three regions, and these three pieces of information are somehow maneuvered in the brain or in the eye, or somewhere, to decide what the color is."
6146,It is easy to demonstrate that all of the rules of color mixing would be a consequence of this proposition.
6147,"There has been considerable debate about the thing because the next problem, of course, is to find the absorption characteristics of each of the three pigments."
6148,"It turns out, unfortunately, that because we can transform the color coordinates in any manner we want to, we can only find all kinds of linear combinations of absorption curves by the color-mixing experiments, but not the curves for the individual pigments."
6149,People have tried in various ways to obtain a specific curve which does describe some particular physical property of the eye.
6150,"One such curve is called a brightness curve, demonstrated in Fig."
6151,35–3.
6152,"In this figure are two curves, one for eyes in the dark, the other for eyes in the light; the latter is the cone brightness curve."
6153,This is measured by finding what is the smallest amount of colored light we need in order to be able to just see it.
6154,This measures how sensitive the eye is in different spectral regions.
6155,There is another very interesting way to measure this.
6156,"If we take two colors and make them appear in an area, by flickering back and forth from one to the other, we see a flicker if the frequency is too low."
6157,"Now if we adjust the brightness or the intensity of one color against the other, there comes an intensity where the flicker at 16 cycles disappears."
6158,"To get flicker with the brightness so adjusted, we have to go to a much lower frequency in order to see a flicker of the color."
6159,"So, we get what we call a flicker of the brightness at a higher frequency and, at a lower frequency, a flicker of the color."
6160,It is possible to match two colors for “equal brightness” by this flicker technique.
6161,"The results are almost, but not exactly, the same as those obtained by measuring the threshold sensitivity of the eye for seeing weak light by the cones."
6162,Most workers use the flicker system as a definition of the brightness curve.
6163,"Now, if there are three color-sensitive pigments in the eye, the problem is to determine the shape of the absorption spectrum of each one."
6164,How?
6165,"We know there are people who are color blind—eight percent of the male population, and one-half of one percent of the female population."
6166,"Most of the people who are color blind or abnormal in color vision have a different degree of sensitivity than others to a variation of color, but they still need three colors to match."
6167,"However, there are some who are called dichromats, for whom any color can be matched using only two primary colors."
6168,"The obvious suggestion, then, is to say that they are missing one of the three pigments."
6169,"If we can find three kinds of color-blind dichromats who have different color-mixing rules, one kind should be missing the red, another the green, and another the blue pigmentation."
6170,By measuring all these types we can determine the three curves!
6171,"It turns out that there are three types of dichromatic color blindness; there are two common types and a third very rare type, and from these three it has been possible to deduce the pigment absorption spectra."
6172,Figure 35–6 shows the color mixing of a particular type of color-blind person called a deuteranope.
6173,"For him, the loci of constant colors are not points, but certain lines, along each of which the color appears to him to be the same."
6174,"If the theory that he is missing one of the three pieces of information is right, all these lines should intersect at a point."
6175,"If we carefully measure on this graph, they do intersect perfectly."
6176,"Obviously, therefore, this has been made by a mathematician and does not represent real data!"
6177,"As a matter of fact, if we look at the latest paper with real data, it turns out that in the graph of Fig."
6178,"35–6, the point of focus of all the lines is not exactly at the right place."
6179,"Using the lines in the above figure, we cannot find reasonable spectra; we need negative and positive absorptions in different regions."
6180,"But using the new data of Yustova, it turns out that each of the absorption curves is everywhere positive."
6181,"Figure 35–7 shows a different kind of color blindness, that of the protanope, which has a focus near the red end of the boundary curve."
6182,Yustova gets approximately the same position in this case.
6183,"Using the three different kinds of color blindness, the three pigment response curves have finally been determined, and are shown in Fig."
6184,35–8.
6185,Finally?
6186,Perhaps.
6187,"There is a question as to whether the three-pigment idea is right, whether color blindness results from lack of one pigment, and even whether the color-mix data on color blindness are right."
6188,Different workers get different results.
6189,This field is still very much under development.
6190,"Now, what about checking these curves against actual pigments in the eye?"
6191,The pigments that can be obtained from a retina consist mainly of a pigment called visual purple.
6192,"The most remarkable features of this are, first, that it is in the eye of almost every vertebrate animal, and second, that its response curve fits beautifully with the sensitivity of the eye, as seen in Fig."
6193,"35–9, in which are plotted on the same scale the absorption of visual purple and the sensitivity of the dark-adapted eye."
6194,"This pigment is evidently the pigment that we see with in the dark: visual purple is the pigment for the rods, and it has nothing to do with color vision."
6195,This fact was discovered in 1877.
6196,Even today it can be said that the color pigments of the cones have never been obtained in a test tube.
6197,In 1958 it could be said that the color pigments had never been seen at all.
6198,"But since that time, two of them have been detected by Rushton by a very simple and beautiful technique."
6199,"The trouble is, presumably, that since the eye is so weakly sensitive to bright light compared with light of low intensity, it needs a lot of visual purple to see with, but not much of the color pigments for seeing colors."
6200,"Rushton’s idea is to leave the pigment in the eye, and measure it anyway."
6201,What he does is this.
6202,There is an instrument called an ophthalmoscope for sending light into the eye through the lens and then focusing the light that comes back out.
6203,With it one can measure how much is reflected.
6204,"So one measures the reflection coefficient of light which has gone twice through the pigment (reflected by a back layer in the eyeball, and coming out through the pigment of the cone again)."
6205,Nature is not always so beautifully designed.
6206,The cones are interestingly designed so that the light that comes into the cone bounces around and works its way down into the little sensitive points at the apex.
6207,"The light goes right down into the sensitive point, bounces at the bottom and comes back out again, having traversed a considerable amount of the color-vision pigment; also, by looking at the fovea, where there are no rods, one is not confused by visual purple."
6208,"But the color of the retina has been seen a long time ago: it is a sort of orangey pink; then there are all the blood vessels, and the color of the material at the back, and so on."
6209,How do we know when we are looking at the pigment?
6210,"Answer: First we take a color-blind person, who has fewer pigments and for whom it is therefore easier to make the analysis."
6211,"Second, the various pigments, like visual purple, have an intensity change when they are bleached by light; when we shine light on them they change their concentration."
6212,"So, while looking at the absorption spectrum of the eye, Rushton put another beam in the whole eye, which changes the concentration of the pigment, and he measured the change in the spectrum, and the difference, of course, has nothing to do with the amount of blood or the color of the reflecting layers, and so on, but only the pigment, and in this manner Rushton obtained a curve for the pigment of the protanope eye, which is given in Fig."
6213,35–10.
6214,The second curve in Fig.
6215,35–10 is a curve obtained with a normal eye.
6216,"This was obtained by taking a normal eye and, having already determined what one pigment was, bleaching the other one in the red where the first one is insensitive."
6217,"Red light has no effect on the protanope eye, but does in the normal eye, and thus one can obtain the curve for the missing pigment."
6218,"The shape of one curve fits beautifully with Yustova’s green curve, but the red curve is a little bit displaced."
6219,So perhaps we are getting on the right track.
6220,Or perhaps not—the latest work with deuteranopes does not show any definite pigment missing.
6221,Color is not a question of the physics of the light itself.
6222,"Color is a sensation, and the sensation for different colors is different in different circumstances."
6223,"For instance, if we have a pink light, made by superimposing crossing beams of white light and red light (all we can make with white and red is pink, obviously), we may show that white light may appear blue."
6224,"If we place an object in the beams, it casts two shadows—one illuminated by the white light alone and the other by the red."
6225,"For most people the “white” shadow of an object looks blue, but if we keep expanding this shadow until it covers the entire screen, we see that it suddenly appears white, not blue!"
6226,"We can get other effects of the same nature by mixing red, yellow, and white light."
6227,"Red, yellow, and white light can produce only orangey yellows, and so on."
6228,"So if we mix such lights roughly equally, we get only orange light."
6229,"Nevertheless, by casting different kinds of shadows in the light, with various overlaps of colors, one gets quite a series of beautiful colors which are not in the light themselves (that is only orange), but in our sensations."
6230,We clearly see many different colors that are quite unlike the “physical” ones in the beam.
6231,"It is very important to appreciate that a retina is already “thinking” about the light; it is comparing what it sees in one region with what it sees in another, although not consciously."
6232,What we know of how it does that is the subject of the next chapter.

6247,(There was no summary for this lecture.)
6248,"In discussing the sense of sight, we have to realize that (outside of a gallery of modern art!)"
6249,one does not see random spots of color or spots of light.
6250,"When we look at an object we see a man or a thing; in other words, the brain interprets what we see."
6251,"How it does that, no one knows, and it does it, of course, at a very high level."
6252,"Although we evidently do learn to recognize what a man looks like after much experience, there are a number of features of vision which are more elementary but which also involve combining information from different parts of what we see."
6253,"To help us understand how we make an interpretation of an entire image, it is worthwhile to study the earliest stages of the putting together of information from the different retinal cells."
6254,"In the present chapter we shall concentrate mainly on that aspect of vision, although we shall also mention a number of side issues as we go along."
6255,"An example of the fact that we have an accumulation, at a very elementary level, of information from several parts of the eye at the same time, beyond our voluntary control or ability to learn, was that blue shadow which was produced by white light when both white and red were shining on the same screen."
6256,"This effect at least involves the knowledge that the background of the screen is pink, even though, when we are looking at the blue shadow, it is only “white” light coming into a particular spot in the eye; somewhere, pieces of information have been put together."
6257,"The more complete and familiar the context is, the more the eye will make corrections for peculiarities."
6258,"In fact, Land has shown that if we mix that apparent blue and the red in various proportions, by using two photographic transparencies with absorption in front of the red and the white in different proportions, it can be made to represent a real scene, with real objects, rather faithfully."
6259,"In this case we get a lot of intermediate apparent colors too, analogous to what we would get by mixing red and blue-green; it seems to be an almost complete set of colors, but if we look very hard at them, they are not so very good."
6260,"Even so, it is surprising how much can be obtained from just red and white."
6261,"The more the scene looks like a real situation, the more one is able to compensate for the fact that all the light is actually nothing but pink!"
6262,"Another example is the appearance of “colors” in a black-and-white rotating disc, whose black and white areas are as shown in Fig."
6263,36–1.
6264,"When the disc is rotated, the variations of light and dark at any one radius are exactly the same; it is only the background that is different for the two kinds of “stripes.” Yet one of the “rings” appears colored with one color and the other with another.1  No one yet understands the reason for those colors, but it is clear that information is being put together at a very elementary level, in the eye itself, most likely."
6265,"Almost all present-day theories of color vision agree that the color-mixing data indicate that there are only three pigments in the cones of the eye, and that it is the spectral absorption in those three pigments that fundamentally produces the color sense."
6266,But the total sensation that is associated with the absorption characteristics of the three pigments acting together is not necessarily the sum of the individual sensations.
6267,"We all agree that yellow simply does not seem to be reddish green; in fact it might be a tremendous surprise to most people to discover that light is, in fact, a mixture of colors, because presumably the sensation of light is due to some other process than a simple mixture like a chord in music, where the three notes are there at the same time and if we listen hard we can hear them individually."
6268,We cannot look hard and see the red and the green.
6269,"The earliest theories of vision said that there are three pigments and three kinds of cones, each kind containing one pigment; that a nerve runs from each cone to the brain, so that the three pieces of information are carried to the brain; and then in the brain, anything can happen."
6270,"This, of course, is an incomplete idea: it does no good to discover that the information is carried along the optic nerve to the brain, because we have not even started to solve the problem."
6271,We must ask more basic questions: Does it make any difference where the information is put together?
6272,"Is it important that it be carried right up into the brain in the optic nerve, or could the retina do some analysis first?"
6273,We have seen a picture of the retina as an extremely complicated thing with lots of interconnections (Fig.
6274,35–2) and it might make some analyses.
6275,"As a matter of fact, people who study anatomy and the development of the eye have shown that the retina is, in fact, the brain: in the development of the embryo, a piece of the brain comes out in front, and long fibers grow back, connecting the eyes to the brain."
6276,"The retina is organized in just the way the brain is organized and, as someone has beautifully put it, “The brain has developed a way to look out upon the world.” The eye is a piece of brain that is touching light, so to speak, on the outside."
6277,So it is not at all unlikely that some analysis of the color has already been made in the retina.
6278,This gives us a very interesting opportunity.
6279,"None of the other senses involves such a large amount of calculation, so to speak, before the signal gets into a nerve that one can make measurements on."
6280,"The calculations for all the rest of the senses usually happen in the brain itself, where it is very difficult to get at specific places to make measurements, because there are so many interconnections."
6281,"Here, with the visual sense, we have the light, three layers of cells making calculations, and the results of the calculations being transmitted through the optic nerve."
6282,"So we have the first chance to observe physiologically how, perhaps, the first layers of the brain work in their first steps."
6283,"It is thus of double interest, not simply interesting for vision, but interesting to the whole problem of physiology."
6284,The fact that there are three pigments does not mean that there must be three kinds of sensations.
6285,One of the other theories of color vision has it that there are really opposing color schemes (Fig.
6286,36–2).
6287,"That is, one of the nerve fibers carries a lot of impulses if there is yellow being seen, and less than usual for blue."
6288,"Another nerve fiber carries green and red information in the same way, and another, white and black."
6289,"In other words, in this theory someone has already started to make a guess as to the system of wiring, the method of calculation."
6290,"The problems we are trying to solve by guessing at these first calculations are questions about the apparent colors that are seen on a pink background, what happens when the eye is adapted to different colors, and also the so-called psychological phenomena."
6291,"The psychological phenomena are of the nature, for instance, that white does not “feel” like red and yellow and blue, and this theory was advanced because the psychologists say that there are four apparent pure colors: “There are four stimuli which have a remarkable capacity to evoke psychologically simple blue, yellow, green, and red hues respectively."
6292,"Unlike sienna, magenta, purple, or most of the discriminable colors, these simple hues are unmixed in the sense that none partakes of the nature of the other; specifically, blue is not yellowish, reddish, or greenish, and so on; these are psychologically primary hues.” That is a psychological fact, so-called."
6293,"To find out from what evidence this psychological fact was deduced, we must search very hard indeed through all the literature: In the modern literature all we find on the subject are repeats of the same statement, or of one by a German psychologist, who uses as one of his authorities Leonardo da Vinci, who, of course, we all know was a great artist."
6294,"He says, “Leonardo thought there were five colors.” Then, looking still further, we find, in a still older book, the evidence for the subject."
6295,"The book says something like this: “Purple is reddish-blue, orange is reddish-yellow, but can red be seen as purplish-orange?"
6296,Are not red and yellow more unitary than purple or orange?
6297,"The average person, asked to state which colors are unitary, names red, yellow, and blue, these three, and some observers add a fourth, green."
6298,"Psychologists are accustomed to accept the four as salient hues.” So that is the situation in the psychological analysis of this matter: if everybody says there are three, and somebody says there are four, and they want it to be four, it will be four."
6299,That shows the difficulty with psychological researches.
6300,"It is clear that we have such feelings, but it is very difficult to obtain much information about them."
6301,"So the other direction to go is the physiological direction, to find out experimentally what actually happens in the brain, the eye, the retina, or wherever, and perhaps to discover that some combinations of impulses from various cells move along certain nerve fibers."
6302,"Incidentally, primary pigments do not have to be in separate cells; one could have cells in which are mixtures of the various pigments, cells with the red and the green pigments, cells with all three (the information of all three is then white information), and so on."
6303,"There are many ways of hooking the system up, and we have to find out which way nature has used."
6304,"It would be hoped, ultimately, that when we understand the physiological connections we will have a little bit of understanding of some of those aspects of the psychology, so we look in that direction."
6305,"We begin by talking not only about color vision, but about vision in general, just to remind ourselves about the interconnections in the retina, shown in Fig."
6306,35–2.
6307,The retina is really like the surface of the brain.
6308,"Although the actual picture through a microscope is a little more complicated looking than this somewhat schematized drawing, by careful analysis one can see all these interconnections."
6309,"There is no question that one part of the surface of the retina is connected to other parts, and that the information that comes out on the long axons, which produce the optic nerve, are combinations of information from many cells."
6310,"There are three layers of cells in the succession of function: there are retinal cells, which are the ones that the light affects, an intermediate cell which takes information from a single or a few retinal cells and gives it out again to several cells in a third layer of cells and carries it to the brain."
6311,There are all kinds of cross connections between cells in the layers.
6312,We now turn to some aspects of the structure and performance of the eye (see Fig.
6313,35–1).
6314,"The focusing of the light is accomplished mainly by the cornea, by the fact that it has a curved surface which “bends” the light."
6315,"(It would be nice if we could make optical glass in which we could adjust the index throughout, for then we would not have to curve it as much as we do when we have a uniform index.)"
6316,"Furthermore, the shape of the cornea is not that of a sphere."
6317,A spherical lens has a certain amount of spherical aberration.
6318,"The cornea is “flatter” at the outside than is a sphere, in just such a manner that the spherical aberration is less for the cornea than it would be if we put a spherical lens in there!"
6319,The light is focused by the cornea-lens system onto the retina.
6320,"As we look at things that are closer and farther away, the lens tightens and loosens and changes the focus to adjust for the different distances."
6321,"To adjust for the total amount of light there is the iris, which is what we call the color of the eye, brown or blue, depending on who it is; as the amount of light increases and decreases, the iris moves in and out."
6322,"Let us now look at the neural machinery for controlling the accommodation of the lens, the motion of the eye, the muscles which turn the eye in the socket, and the iris, shown schematically in Fig."
6323,36–3.
6324,"These are the fibers which measure the average light and make adjustment for the iris; or, if the image looks foggy, they try to correct the lens; or, if there is a double image, they try to adjust the eye for binocular vision."
6325,"At any rate, they go through the mid-brain and feed back into the eye."
6326,The iris has two muscle systems.
6327,"The opposite muscles are radial muscles, so that, when the things get dark and the circular muscle relaxes, these radial muscles pull out."
6328,"Here we have, as in many places in the body, a pair of muscles which work in opposite directions, and in almost every such case the nerve systems which control the two are very delicately adjusted, so that when signals are sent in to tighten one, signals are automatically sent in to loosen the other."
6329,"The iris is a peculiar exception: the nerves which make the iris contract are the ones we have already described, but the nerves which make the iris expand come out from no one knows exactly where, go down into the spinal cord back of the chest, into the thoracic sections, out of the spinal cord, up through the neck ganglia, and all the way around and back up into the head in order to run the other end of the iris."
6330,"In fact, the signal goes through a completely different nervous system, not the central nervous system at all, but the sympathetic nervous system, so it is a very strange way of making things go."
6331,"We have already emphasized another strange thing about the eye, that the light-sensitive cells are on the wrong side, so that the light has to go through several layers of other cells before it gets to the receptors—it is built inside out!"
6332,So some of the features are wonderful and some are apparently stupid.
6333,Figure 36–4 shows the connections of the eye to the part of the brain which is most directly concerned with the visual process.
6334,"Notice that some of the fibers from each eye are sent over to the other side of the brain, so the picture formed is incomplete."
6335,"So the left side of the brain receives all the information which comes from the left side of the eyeball of each eye, i.e., on the right side of the visual field, while the right side of the brain sees the left side of the visual field."
6336,This is the manner in which the information from each of the two eyes is put together in order to tell how far away things are.
6337,This is the system of binocular vision.
6338,The connections between the retina and the visual cortex are interesting.
6339,"If a spot in the retina is excised or destroyed in any way, then the whole fiber will die, and we can thereby find out where it is connected."
6340,"It turns out that, essentially, the connections are one to one—for each spot in the retina there is one spot in the visual cortex—and spots that are very close together in the retina are very close together in the visual cortex."
6341,"So the visual cortex still represents the spatial arrangement of the rods and cones, but of course much distorted."
6342,"Things which are in the center of the field, which occupy a very small part of the retina, are expanded over many, many cells in the visual cortex."
6343,"It is clear that it is useful to have things which are originally close together, still close together."
6344,"The most remarkable aspect of the matter, however, is the following."
6345,The place where one would think it would be most important to have things close together would be right in the middle of the visual field.
6346,"Believe it or not, the up-and-down line in our visual field as we look at something is of such a nature that the information from all the points on the right side of that line is going into the left side of the brain, and information from the points on the left side is going into the right side of the brain, and the way this area is made, there is a cut right down through the middle, so that the things that are very close together right in the middle are very far apart in the brain!"
6347,"Somehow, the information has to go from one side of the brain to the other through some other channels, which is quite surprising."
6348,The question of how this network ever gets “wired” together is very interesting.
6349,The problem of how much is already wired and how much is learned is an old one.
6350,"It used to be thought long ago that perhaps it does not have to be wired carefully at all, it is only just roughly interconnected, and then, by experience, the young child learns that when a thing is “up there” it produces some sensation in the brain."
6351,"(Doctors always tell us what the young child “feels,” but how do they know what a child feels at the age of one?)"
6352,"The child, at the age of one, supposedly sees that an object is “up there,” gets a certain sensation, and learns to reach “there,” because when he reaches “here,” it does not work."
6353,"That approach probably is not correct, because we already see that in many cases there are these special detailed interconnections."
6354,More illuminating are some most remarkable experiments done with a salamander.
6355,"(Incidentally, with the salamander there is a direct crossover connection, without the optic chiasma, because the eyes are on each side of the head and have no common area."
6356,Salamanders do not have binocular vision.)
6357,The experiment is this.
6358,We can cut the optic nerve in a salamander and the nerve will grow out from the eyes again.
6359,Thousands and thousands of cell fibers will thus re-establish themselves.
6360,"Now, in the optic nerve the fibers do not stay adjacent to each other—it is like a great, sloppily made telephone cable, all the fibers twisting and turning, but when it gets to the brain they are all sorted out again."
6361,"When we cut the optic nerve of the salamander, the interesting question is, will it ever get straightened out?"
6362,The answer is remarkable: yes.
6363,"If we cut the optic nerve of the salamander and it grows back, the salamander has good visual acuity again."
6364,"However, if we cut the optic nerve and turn the eye upside down and let it grow back again, it has good visual acuity all right, but it has a terrible error: when the salamander sees a fly “up here,” it jumps at it “down there,” and it never learns."
6365,Therefore there is some mysterious way by which the thousands and thousands of fibers find their right places in the brain.
6366,"This problem of how much is wired in, and how much is not, is an important problem in the theory of the development of creatures."
6367,"The answer is not known, but is being studied intensively."
6368,"The same experiment in the case of a goldfish shows that there is a terrible knot, like a great scar or complication, in the optic nerve where we cut it, but in spite of all this the fibers grow back to their right places in the brain."
6369,"In order to do this, as they grow into the old channels of the optic nerve they must make several decisions about the direction in which they should grow."
6370,How do they do this?
6371,There seem to be chemical clues that different fibers respond to differently.
6372,"Think of the enormous number of growing fibers, each of which is an individual differing in some way from its neighbors; in responding to whatever the chemical clues are, it responds in a unique enough way to find its proper place for ultimate connection in the brain!"
6373,This is an interesting—a fantastic—thing.
6374,"It is one of the great recently discovered phenomena of biology and is undoubtedly connected to many older unsolved problems of growth, organization, and development of organisms, and particularly of embryos."
6375,One other interesting phenomenon has to do with the motion of the eye.
6376,The eyes must be moved in order to make the two images coincide in different circumstances.
6377,"These motions are of different kinds: one is to follow something, which requires that both eyes must go in the same direction, right or left, and the other is to point them toward the same place at various distances away, which requires that they must move oppositely."
6378,The nerves going into the muscles of the eye are already wired up for just such purposes.
6379,"There is one set of nerves which will pull the muscles on the inside of one eye and the outside of the other, and relax the opposite muscles, so that the two eyes move together."
6380,There is another center where an excitation will cause the eyes to move in toward each other from parallel.
6381,"Either eye can be turned out to the corner if the other eye moves toward the nose, but it is impossible consciously or unconsciously to turn both eyes out at the same time, not because there are no muscles, but because there is no way to send a signal to turn both eyes out, unless we have had an accident or there is something the matter, for instance if a nerve has been cut."
6382,"Although the muscles of one eye can certainly steer that eye about, not even a Yogi is able to move both eyes out freely under voluntary control, because there does not seem to be any way to do it."
6383,We are already wired to a certain extent.
6384,"This is an important point, because most of the earlier books on anatomy and psychology, and so on, do not appreciate or do not emphasize the fact that we are so completely wired already—they say that everything is just learned."
6385,Let us now examine in more detail what happens in the rod cells.
6386,Figure 36–5 shows an electron micrograph of the middle of a rod cell (the rod cell keeps going up out of the field).
6387,"There are layer after layer of plane structures, shown magnified at the right, which contain the substance rhodopsin (visual purple), the dye, or pigment, which produces the effects of vision in the rods."
6388,"The rhodopsin, which is the pigment, is a big protein which contains a special group called retinene, which can be taken off the protein, and which is, undoubtedly, the main cause of the absorption of light."
6389,"We do not understand the reason for the planes, but it is very likely that there is some reason for holding all the rhodopsin molecules parallel."
6390,"The chemistry of the thing has been worked out to a large extent, but there might be some physics to it."
6391,"It may be that all of the molecules are arranged in some kind of a row so that when one is excited an electron which is generated, say, may run all the way down to some place at the end to get the signal out, or something."
6392,"This subject is very important, and has not been worked out."
6393,"It is a field in which both biochemistry and solid state physics, or something like it, will ultimately be used."
6394,"This kind of a structure, with layers, appears in other circumstances where light is important, for example in the chloroplast in plants, where the light causes photosynthesis."
6395,"If we magnify those, we find the same thing with almost the same kind of layers, but there we have chlorophyll, of course, instead of retinene."
6396,The chemical form of retinene is shown in Fig.
6397,36–6.
6398,"It has a series of alternate double bonds along the side chain, which is characteristic of nearly all strongly absorbing organic substances, like chlorophyll, blood, and so on."
6399,This substance is impossible for human beings to manufacture in their own cells—we have to eat it.
6400,"So we eat it in the form of a special substance, which is exactly the same as retinene except that there is a hydrogen tied on the right end; it is called vitamin A, and if we do not eat enough of it, we do not get a supply of retinene, and the eye becomes what we call night blind, because there is then not enough pigment in the rhodopsin to see with the rods at night."
6401,The reason why such a series of double bonds absorbs light very strongly is also known.
6402,"We may just give a hint: The alternating series of double bonds is called a conjugated double bond; a double bond means that there is an extra electron there, and this extra electron is easily shifted to the right or left."
6403,"When light strikes this molecule, the electron of each double bond is shifted over by one step."
6404,"All the electrons in the whole chain shift, like a string of dominoes falling over, and though each one moves only a little distance (we would expect that, in a single atom, we could move the electron only a little distance), the net effect is the same as though the one at the end was moved over to the other end!"
6405,"It is the same as though one electron went the whole distance back and forth, and so, in this manner, we get a much stronger absorption under the influence of the electric field, than if we could only move the electron a distance which is associated with one atom."
6406,"So, since it is easy to move the electrons back and forth, retinene absorbs light very strongly; that is the machinery of the physical-chemical end of it."
6407,Let us now return to biology.
6408,The human eye is not the only kind of eye.
6409,"In the vertebrates, almost all eyes are essentially like the human eye."
6410,"However, in the lower animals there are many other kinds of eyes: eye spots, various eye cups, and other less sensitive things, which we have no time to discuss."
6411,"But there is one other highly developed eye among the invertebrates, the compound eye of the insect."
6412,(Most insects having large compound eyes also have various additional simpler eyes as well.)
6413,A bee is an insect whose vision has been studied very carefully.
6414,"It is easy to study the properties of the vision of bees because they are attracted to honey, and we can make experiments in which we identify the honey by putting it on blue paper or red paper, and see which one they come to."
6415,By this method some very interesting things have been discovered about the vision of the bee.
6416,"In the first place, in trying to measure how acutely bees could see the color difference between two pieces of “white” paper, some researchers found they were not very good, and others found they were fantastically good."
6417,"Even if the two pieces of white paper were almost exactly the same, the bees could still tell the difference."
6418,"The experimenters used zinc white for one piece of paper and lead white for the other, and although these look exactly the same to us, the bee could easily distinguish them, because they reflect a different amount in the ultraviolet."
6419,In this way it was discovered that the bee’s eye is sensitive over a wider range of the spectrum than is our own.
6420,This makes for a number of different interesting effects.
6421,"In the first place, bees can distinguish between many flowers which to us look alike."
6422,"Of course, we must realize that the colors of flowers are not designed for our eyes, but for the bee; they are signals to attract the bees to a specific flower."
6423,We all know that there are many “white” flowers.
6424,"Apparently white is not very interesting to the bees, because it turns out that all of the white flowers have different proportions of reflection in the ultraviolet; they do not reflect one hundred percent of the ultraviolet as would a true white."
6425,"All the light is not coming back, the ultraviolet is missing, and that is a color, just as, for us, if the blue is missing, it comes out yellow."
6426,"So, all the flowers are colored for the bees."
6427,"However, we also know that red cannot be seen by bees."
6428,Thus we might expect that all red flowers should look black to the bee.
6429,Not so!
6430,"A careful study of red flowers shows, first, that even with our own eye we can see that a great majority of red flowers have a bluish tinge because they are mainly reflecting an additional amount in the blue, which is the part that the bee sees."
6431,"Furthermore, experiments also show that flowers vary in their reflection of the ultraviolet over different parts of the petals, and so on."
6432,So if we could see the flowers as bees see them they would be even more beautiful and varied!
6433,"It has been shown, however, that there are a few red flowers which do not reflect in the blue or in the ultraviolet, and would, therefore, appear black to the bee!"
6434,"This was of quite some concern to the people who worry about this matter, because black does not seem like an interesting color, since it is hard to tell from a dirty old shadow."
6435,"It actually turned out that these flowers were not visited by bees, these are the flowers that are visited by hummingbirds, and hummingbirds can see the red!"
6436,"Another interesting aspect of the vision of the bee is that bees can apparently tell the direction of the sun by looking at a patch of blue sky, without seeing the sun itself."
6437,We cannot easily do this.
6438,"If we look out the window at the sky and see that it is blue, in which direction is the sun?"
6439,"The bee can tell, because the bee is quite sensitive to the polarization of light, and the scattered light of the sky is polarized.2 There is still some debate about how this sensitivity operates."
6440,"Whether it is because the reflections of the light are different in different circumstances, or the bee’s eye is directly sensitive, is not yet known.3"
6441,"The motions of bees in the hives are very quick; the feet move and the wings vibrate, but it is very hard for us to see these motions with our eye."
6442,"However, if we could see more rapidly we would be able to see the motion."
6443,It is probably very important to the bee that its eye has such a rapid response.
6444,Now let us discuss the visual acuity we could expect from the bee.
6445,"The eye of a bee is a compound eye, and it is made of a large number of special cells called ommatidia, which are arranged conically on the surface of a sphere (roughly) on the outside of the bee’s head."
6446,Figure 36–7 shows a picture of one such ommatidium.
6447,"At the top there is a transparent area, a kind of “lens,” but actually it is more like a filter or light pipe to make the light come down along the narrow fiber, which is where the absorption presumably occurs."
6448,Out of the other end of it comes the nerve fiber.
6449,"The central fiber is surrounded on its sides by six cells which, in fact, have secreted the fiber."
6450,That is enough description for our purposes; the point is that it is a conical thing and many can fit next to each other all over the surface of the eye of the bee.
6451,Now let us discuss the resolution of the eye of the bee.
6452,If we draw lines (Fig.
6453,If we have a very large ommatidium we do not have much resolution.
6454,"That is, one cell gets a piece of information from one direction, and the adjacent cell gets a piece of information from another direction, and so on, and the bee cannot see things in between very well."
6455,"So the uncertainty of visual acuity in the eye will surely correspond to an angle, the angle of the end of the ommatidium relative to the center of curvature of the eye."
6456,"(The eye cells, of course, exist only at the surface of the sphere; inside that is the head of the bee.)"
6457,"So why doesn’t the bee just use very, very fine ommatidia?” Answer: We know enough physics to realize that if we are trying to get light down into a narrow slot, we cannot see accurately in a given direction because of the diffraction effect."
6458,"If we make them too big, each one sees in a definite direction, but there are not enough of them to get a good view of the scene."
6459,"If we add the two together, and find the place where the sum has a minimum (Fig."
6460,"So, apparently, it really works, and we can understand what determines the size of the bee’s eye!"
6461,It is also easy to put the above number back in and find out how good the bee’s eye actually is in angular resolution; it is very poor relative to our own.
6462,We can see things that are thirty times smaller in apparent size than the bee; the bee has a rather fuzzy out-of-focus image relative to what we can see.
6463,"Nevertheless it is all right, and it is the best they can do."
6464,"We might ask why the bees do not develop a good eye like our own, with a lens and so on."
6465,There are several interesting reasons.
6466,The eye is not good if it is too small.
6467,"Secondly, if it were as big as the bee’s head, then the eye would occupy the whole head of the bee."
6468,"The beauty of the compound eye is that it takes up no space, it is just a very thin layer on the surface of the bee."
6469,"So when we argue that they should have done it our way, we must remember that they had their own problems!"
6470,"Besides the bees, many other animals can see color."
6471,"Fish, butterflies, birds, and reptiles can see color, but it is believed that most mammals cannot."
6472,The primates can see color.
6473,"The birds certainly see color, and that accounts for the colors of birds."
6474,There would be no point in having such brilliantly colored males if the females could not notice it!
6475,"That is, the evolution of the sexual “whatever it is” that the birds have is a result of the female being able to see color."
6476,"So next time we look at a peacock and think of what a brilliant display of gorgeous color it is, and how delicate all the colors are, and what a wonderful aesthetic sense it takes to appreciate all that, we should not compliment the peacock, but should compliment the visual acuity and aesthetic sense of the peahen, because that is what has generated the beautiful scene!"
6477,"All invertebrates have poorly developed eyes or compound eyes, but all the vertebrates have eyes very similar to our own, with one exception."
6478,"If we consider the highest form of animal, we usually say, “Here we are!,” but if we take a less prejudiced point of view and restrict ourselves to the invertebrates, so that we cannot include ourselves, and ask what is the highest invertebrate animal, most zoologists agree that the octopus is the highest animal!"
6479,"It is very interesting that, besides the development of its brain and its reactions and so on, which are rather good for an invertebrate, it has also developed, independently, a different eye."
6480,"It is not a compound eye or an eye spot—it has a cornea, it has lids, it has an iris, it has a lens, it has two regions of water, it has a retina behind."
6481,It is essentially the same as the eye of the vertebrates!
6482,"It is a remarkable example of a coincidence in evolution where nature has twice discovered the same solution to a problem, with one slight improvement."
6483,"In the octopus it also turns out, amazingly, that the retina is a piece of the brain that has come out in the same way in its embryonic development as is true for vertebrates, but the interesting thing which is different is that the cells which are sensitive to light are on the inside, and the cells which do the calculation are in back of them, rather than “inside out,” as in our eye."
6484,"So we see, at least, that there is no good reason for its being inside out."
6485,"The other time nature tried it, she got it straightened out!"
6486,(See Fig.
6487,36–10.)
6488,One of the main points of our subject is the interconnection of information from one part of the eye to the other.
6489,"Let us consider the compound eye of the horseshoe crab, on which considerable experimentation has been done."
6490,"First of all, we must appreciate what kind of information can come along nerves."
6491,"A nerve carries a kind of disturbance which has an electrical effect that is easy to detect, a kind of wavelike disturbance which runs down the nerve and produces an effect at the other end: a long piece of the nerve cell, called the axon, carries the information along, and a certain kind of impulse, called a “spike,” goes along if it is excited at one end."
6492,"When one spike goes down the nerve, another cannot immediately follow."
6493,"All the spikes are of the same size, so it is not that we get higher spikes when the thing is more strongly excited, but that we get more spikes per second."
6494,The size of the spike is determined by the fiber.
6495,It is important to appreciate this in order to see what happens next.
6496,"Figure 36–11(a) shows the compound eye of the horseshoe crab; it is not very much of an eye, it has only about a thousand ommatidia."
6497,"Figure 36–11(b) is a cross section through the system; one can see the ommatidia, with the nerve fibers that run out of them and go into the brain."
6498,But note that even in a horseshoe crab there are little interconnections.
6499,"They are much less elaborate than in the human eye, and it gives us a chance to study a simpler example."
6500,"Let us now look at the experiments which have been done by putting fine electrodes into the optic nerve of the horseshoe crab, and shining light on only one of the ommatidia, which is easy to do with lenses."
6501,36–12(a).
6502,"When the light goes out, the discharge stops."
6503,"Now it is very interesting that if, while our amplifier is connected to this same nerve fiber, we shine light on a different ommatidium nothing happens; no signal."
6504,"Now we do another experiment: we shine the light on the original ommatidium and get the same response, but if we now turn light on another one nearby as well, the pulses are interrupted briefly and then run at a much lower rate (Fig."
6505,36–12b).
6506,The rate of one is inhibited by the impulses which are coming out of the other!
6507,"In other words, each nerve fiber carries the information from one ommatidium, but the amount that it carries is inhibited by the signals from the others."
6508,"So, for example, if the whole eye is more or less uniformly illuminated, the information coming from any one ommatidium will be relatively weak, because it is inhibited by so many."
6509,In fact the inhibition is additive—if we shine light on several nearby ommatidia the inhibition is very great.
6510,"The inhibition is greater when the ommatidia are closer, and if the ommatidia are far enough away from one another, inhibition is practically zero."
6511,So it is additive and depends on the distance; here is a first example of information from different parts of the eye being combined in the eye itself.
6512,"We can see, perhaps, if we think about it awhile, that this is a device to enhance contrast at the edges of objects, because if a part of the scene is light and a part is black, then the ommatidia in the lighted area give impulses that are inhibited by all the other light in the neighborhood, so it is relatively weak."
6513,"On the other hand, an ommatidium at the boundary which is given a “white” impulse is also inhibited by others in the neighborhood, but there are not as many of them, since some are black; the net signal is therefore stronger."
6514,"The result would be a curve, something like that of Fig."
6515,36–13.
6516,The crab will see an enhancement of the contour.
6517,The fact that there is an enhancement of contours has long been known; in fact it is a remarkable thing that has been commented on by psychologists many times.
6518,"In order to draw an object, we have only to draw its outline."
6519,How used we are to looking at pictures that have only the outline!
6520,What is the outline?
6521,The outline is only the edge difference between light and dark or one color and another.
6522,It is not something definite.
6523,"It is not, believe it or not, that every object has a line around it!"
6524,There is no such line.
6525,It is only in our own psychological makeup that there is a line; we are beginning to understand the reasons why the “line” is enough of a clue to get the whole thing.
6526,"Presumably our own eye works in some similar manner—much more complicated, but similar."
6527,"Finally, we shall briefly describe the more elaborate work, the beautiful, advanced work that has been done on the frog."
6528,"Doing a corresponding experiment on a frog, by putting very fine, beautifully built needlelike probes into the optic nerve of a frog, one can obtain the signals that are going along one particular axon and, just as in the case of the horseshoe crab, we find that the information does not depend on just one spot in the eye, but is a sum of information over several spots."
6529,The most recent picture of the operation of the frog’s eye is the following.
6530,"One can find four different kinds of optic nerve fibers, in the sense that there are four different kinds of responses."
6531,"These experiments were not done by shining on-and-off impulses of light, because that is not what a frog sees."
6532,"A frog just sits there and his eyes never move, unless the lily pad is flopping back and forth, and in that case his eyes wobble just right so that the image stays put."
6533,He does not turn his eyes.
6534,"If anything moves in his field of vision, like a little bug (he has to be able to see something small moving in the fixed background), it turns out that there are four different kinds of fibers which discharge, whose properties are summarized in Table 36–1."
6535,"Sustained edge detection, nonerasable, means that if we bring an object with an edge into the field of view of the frog, then there are a lot of impulses in this particular fiber while the object is moving, but they die down to a sustained impulse that continues as long as the edge is there, even if it is standing still."
6536,"If we turn out the light, the impulses stop."
6537,"If we turn it on again while the edge is still in view, they start again."
6538,They are not erasable.
6539,"Another kind of fiber is very similar, except that if the edge is straight it does not work."
6540,It must be a convex edge with dark behind it!
6541,How complicated must be the system of interconnections in the retina of the eye of the frog in order for it to understand that a convex surface has moved in!
6542,"Furthermore, although this fiber does sustain somewhat, it does not sustain as long as the other, and if we turn out the light and turn it on again it does not build up again."
6543,It depends on the moving in of the convex surface.
6544,"The eye sees it move in and remembers that it is there, but if we merely turn out the light for a moment, it simply forgets it and no longer sees it."
6545,Another example is change-in-contrast detection.
6546,"If there is an edge moving in or out there are pulses, but if the thing stands still there are no pulses at all."
6547,Then there is a dimming detector.
6548,"If the light intensity is going down it creates pulses, but if it stays down or stays up, the impulse stops; it only works while the light is dimming."
6549,"Then, finally, there are a few fibers which are dark detectors—a most amazing thing—they fire all the time!"
6550,"If we increase the light, they fire less rapidly, but all the time."
6551,"If we decrease the light, they fire more rapidly, all the time."
6552,"In the dark they fire like mad, perpetually saying, “It is dark!"
6553,It is dark!
6554,It is dark!”
6555,"Now these responses seem to be rather complicated to classify, and we might wonder whether perhaps the experiments are being misinterpreted."
6556,But it is very interesting that these same classes are very clearly separated in the anatomy of the frog!
6557,"By other measurements, after these responses had been classified (afterwards, that is what is important about this), it was discovered that the speed of the signals on the different fibers was not the same, so here was another, independent way to check which kind of a fiber we have found!"
6558,Another interesting question is from how big an area is one particular fiber making its calculations?
6559,The answer is different for the different classes.
6560,"Figure 36–14 shows the surface of the so-called tectum of a frog, where the nerves come into the brain from the optic nerve."
6561,All the nerve fibers coming in from the optic nerve make connections in various layers of the tectum.
6562,This layered structure is analogous to the retina; that is partly why we know that the brain and retina are very similar.
6563,"Now, by taking an electrode and moving it down in succession through the layers, we can find out which kinds of optic nerves end where, and the beautiful and wonderful result is that the different kinds of fibers end in different layers!"
6564,"(What a coincidence, they got the numbers almost in the right order!"
6565,"No, that is why they numbered them that way, the first paper had the numbers in a different order!)"
6566,"We may briefly summarize what we have just learned this way: There are three pigments, presumably."
6567,"There may be many different kinds of receptor cells containing the three pigments in different proportions, but there are many cross connections which may permit additions and subtractions through addition and reinforcement in the nervous system."
6568,"So before we really understand color vision, we will have to understand the final sensation."
6569,"This subject is still an open one, but these researches with microelectrodes and so on will perhaps ultimately give us more information on how we see color."

6583,628—635.
6584,In the last few chapters we have treated the essential ideas necessary for an understanding of most of the important phenomena of light—or electromagnetic radiation in general.
6585,(We have left a few special topics for next year.
6586,"Specifically, the theory of the index of dense materials and total internal reflection.)"
6587,"What we have dealt with is called the “classical theory” of electric waves, which turns out to be a completely adequate description of nature for a large number of effects."
6588,We have not had to worry yet about the fact that light energy comes in lumps or “photons.”
6589,"We would like to take up as our next subject the problem of the behavior of relatively large pieces of matter—their mechanical and thermal properties, for instance."
6590,"In discussing these, we will find that the “classical” (or older) theory fails almost immediately, because matter is really made up of atomic-sized particles."
6591,"Still, we will deal only with the classical part, because that is the only part that we can understand using the classical mechanics we have been learning."
6592,But we shall not be very successful.
6593,"We shall find that in the case of matter, unlike the case of light, we shall be in difficulty relatively soon."
6594,"We could, of course, continuously skirt away from the atomic effects, but we shall instead interpose here a short excursion in which we will describe the basic ideas of the quantum properties of matter, i.e., the quantum ideas of atomic physics, so that you will have some feeling for what it is we are leaving out."
6595,For we will have to leave out some important subjects that we cannot avoid coming close to.
6596,"So we will give now the introduction to the subject of quantum mechanics, but will not be able actually to get into the subject until much later."
6597,"“Quantum mechanics” is the description of the behavior of matter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale."
6598,Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about.
6599,"They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen."
6600,"Newton thought that light was made up of particles, but then it was discovered, as we have seen here, that it behaves like a wave."
6601,"Later, however (in the beginning of the twentieth century) it was found that light did indeed sometimes behave like a particle."
6602,"Historically, the electron, for example, was thought to behave like a particle, and then it was found that in many respects it behaved like a wave."
6603,So it really behaves like neither.
6604,Now we have given up.
6605,We say: “It is like neither.”
6606,"There is one lucky break, however—electrons behave just like light."
6607,"The quantum behavior of atomic objects (electrons, protons, neutrons, photons, and so on) is the same for all, they are all “particle waves,” or whatever you want to call them."
6608,"So what we learn about the properties of electrons (which we shall use for our examples) will apply also to all “particles,” including photons of light."
6609,"The gradual accumulation of information about atomic and small-scale behavior during the first quarter of the 20th century, which gave some indications about how small things do behave, produced an increasing confusion which was finally resolved in 1926 and 1927 by Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and Born."
6610,They finally obtained a consistent description of the behavior of matter on a small scale.
6611,We take up the main features of that description in this chapter.
6612,"Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist."
6613,"Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because all of direct, human experience and of human intuition applies to large objects."
6614,"We know how large objects will act, but things on a small scale just do not act that way."
6615,So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience.
6616,In this chapter we shall tackle immediately the basic element of the mysterious behavior in its most strange form.
6617,"We choose to examine a phenomenon which is impossible, absolutely impossible, to explain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics."
6618,"In reality, it contains the only mystery."
6619,We cannot explain the mystery in the sense of “explaining” how it works.
6620,We will tell you how it works.
6621,In telling you how it works we will have told you about the basic peculiarities of all quantum mechanics.
6622,"To try to understand the quantum behavior of electrons, we shall compare and contrast their behavior, in a particular experimental setup, with the more familiar behavior of particles like bullets, and with the behavior of waves like water waves."
6623,We consider first the behavior of bullets in the experimental setup shown diagrammatically in Fig.
6624,37–1.
6625,We have a machine gun that shoots a stream of bullets.
6626,"It is not a very good gun, in that it sprays the bullets (randomly) over a fairly large angular spread, as indicated in the figure."
6627,In front of the gun we have a wall (made of armor plate) that has in it two holes just about big enough to let a bullet through.
6628,Beyond the wall is a backstop (say a thick wall of wood) which will “absorb” the bullets when they hit it.
6629,In front of the backstop we have an object which we shall call a “detector” of bullets.
6630,It might be a box containing sand.
6631,Any bullet that enters the detector will be stopped and accumulated.
6632,"When we wish, we can empty the box and count the number of bullets that have been caught."
6633,"A bullet which happens to hit one of the holes may bounce off the edges of the hole, and may end up anywhere at all."
6634,"By “probability” we mean the chance that the bullet will arrive at the detector, which we can measure by counting the number which arrive at the detector in a certain time and then taking the ratio of this number to the total number that hit the backstop during that time."
6635,"Or, if we assume that the gun always shoots at the same rate during the measurements, the probability we want is just proportional to the number that reach the detector in some standard time interval."
6636,"For our present purposes we would like to imagine a somewhat idealized experiment in which the bullets are not real bullets, but are indestructible bullets—they cannot break in half."
6637,"In our experiment we find that bullets always arrive in lumps, and when we find something in the detector, it is always one whole bullet."
6638,"If the rate at which the machine gun fires is made very low, we find that at any given moment either nothing arrives, or one and only one—exactly one—bullet arrives at the backstop."
6639,"Also, the size of the lump certainly does not depend on the rate of firing of the gun."
6640,We shall say: “Bullets always arrive in identical lumps.” What we measure with our detector is the probability of arrival of a lump.
6641,"The result of such measurements with this apparatus (we have not yet done the experiment, so we are really imagining the result) are plotted in the graph drawn in part (c) of Fig."
6642,37–1.
6643,Comparing parts (b) and (c) of Fig.
6644,The effect with both holes open is the sum of the effects with each hole open alone.
6645,"We shall call this result an observation of “no interference,” for a reason that you will see later."
6646,So much for bullets.
6647,"They come in lumps, and their probability of arrival shows no interference."
6648,Now we wish to consider an experiment with water waves.
6649,The apparatus is shown diagrammatically in Fig.
6650,37–2.
6651,We have a shallow trough of water.
6652,A small object labeled the “wave source” is jiggled up and down by a motor and makes circular waves.
6653,"To the right of the source we have again a wall with two holes, and beyond that is a second wall, which, to keep things simple, is an “absorber,” so that there is no reflection of the waves that arrive there."
6654,The detector is now a device which measures the “intensity” of the wave motion.
6655,"You can imagine a gadget which measures the height of the wave motion, but whose scale is calibrated in proportion to the square of the actual height, so that the reading is proportional to the intensity of the wave."
6656,"Our detector reads, then, in proportion to the energy being carried by the wave—or rather, the rate at which energy is carried to the detector."
6657,"With our wave apparatus, the first thing to notice is that the intensity can have any size."
6658,"If the source just moves a very small amount, then there is just a little bit of wave motion at the detector."
6659,"When there is more motion at the source, there is more intensity at the detector."
6660,The intensity of the wave can have any value at all.
6661,We would not say that there was any “lumpiness” in the wave intensity.
6662,We have already worked out how such patterns can come about when we studied the interference of electric waves.
6663,"In this case we would observe that the original wave is diffracted at the holes, and new circular waves spread out from each hole."
6664,If we cover one hole at a time and measure the intensity distribution at the absorber we find the rather simple intensity curves shown in part (b) of the figure.
6665,We say that there is “interference” of the two waves.
6666,We say that the two waves are “interfering constructively” at such places.
6667,There will be such constructive interference wherever the distance from the detector to one hole is a whole number of wavelengths larger (or shorter) than the distance from the detector to the other hole.
6668,"The waves “interfere destructively,” and we get a low value for the wave intensity."
6669,37–2 correspond to the places where the two waves interfere destructively.
6670,You will notice that the result is quite different from that obtained with bullets (Eq.
6671,37.1).
6672,"The intensity can have any value, and it shows interference."
6673,Now we imagine a similar experiment with electrons.
6674,It is shown diagrammatically in Fig.
6675,37–3.
6676,We make an electron gun which consists of a tungsten wire heated by an electric current and surrounded by a metal box with a hole in it.
6677,"If the wire is at a negative voltage with respect to the box, electrons emitted by the wire will be accelerated toward the walls and some will pass through the hole."
6678,All the electrons which come out of the gun will have (nearly) the same energy.
6679,In front of the gun is again a wall (just a thin metal plate) with two holes in it.
6680,Beyond the wall is another plate which will serve as a “backstop.” In front of the backstop we place a movable detector.
6681,"The detector might be a geiger counter or, perhaps better, an electron multiplier, which is connected to a loudspeaker."
6682,We should say right away that you should not try to set up this experiment (as you could have done with the two we have already described).
6683,This experiment has never been done in just this way.
6684,The trouble is that the apparatus would have to be made on an impossibly small scale to show the effects we are interested in.
6685,"We are doing a “thought experiment,” which we have chosen because it is easy to think about."
6686,"We know the results that would be obtained because there are many experiments that have been done, in which the scale and the proportions have been chosen to show the effects we shall describe."
6687,"The first thing we notice with our electron experiment is that we hear sharp “clicks” from the detector (that is, from the loudspeaker)."
6688,And all “clicks” are the same.
6689,There are no “half-clicks.”
6690,We would also notice that the “clicks” come very erratically.
6691,Something like: click ….. click-click … click …….. click ….
6692,"click-click …… click …, etc., just as you have, no doubt, heard a geiger counter operating."
6693,"If we count the clicks which arrive in a sufficiently long time—say for many minutes—and then count again for another equal period, we find that the two numbers are very nearly the same."
6694,So we can speak of the average rate at which the clicks are heard (so-and-so-many clicks per minute on the average).
6695,"As we move the detector around, the rate at which the clicks appear is faster or slower, but the size (loudness) of each click is always the same."
6696,"If we lower the temperature of the wire in the gun the rate of clicking slows down, but still each click sounds the same."
6697,"We would notice also that if we put two separate detectors at the backstop, one or the other would click, but never both at once."
6698,"(Except that once in a while, if there were two clicks very close together in time, our ear might not sense the separation.)"
6699,"We conclude, therefore, that whatever arrives at the backstop arrives in “lumps.” All the “lumps” are the same size: only whole “lumps” arrive, and they arrive one at a time at the backstop."
6700,We shall say: “Electrons always arrive in identical lumps.”
6701,37–3.
6702,Yes!
6703,That is the way electrons go.
6704,Now let us try to analyze the curve of Fig.
6705,37–3 to see whether we can understand the behavior of the electrons.
6706,Let us write this in the form of a “Proposition”:
6707,Let us check this idea by experiment.
6708,37–3.
6709,The result seems quite reasonable.
6710,The result of this measurement is also drawn in the figure.
6711,How can such an interference come about?
6712,Perhaps they go in a more complicated way.
6713,They split in half and …” But no!
6714,"There are some points at which very few electrons arrive when both holes are open, but which receive many electrons if we close one hole, so closing one hole increased the number from the other."
6715,It is as though closing one hole decreased the number of electrons which come through the other hole.
6716,It seems hard to explain both effects by proposing that the electrons travel in complicated paths.
6717,It is all quite mysterious.
6718,And the more you look at it the more mysterious it seems.
6719,None of them has succeeded.
6720,"37–2, and that was simple."
6721,The mathematics is the same as that we had for the water waves!
6722,(It is hard to see how one could get such a simple result from a complicated game of electrons going back and forth through the plate on some strange trajectory.)
6723,"We conclude the following: The electrons arrive in lumps, like particles, and the probability of arrival of these lumps is distributed like the distribution of intensity of a wave."
6724,It is in this sense that an electron behaves “sometimes like a particle and sometimes like a wave.”
6725,"Incidentally, when we were dealing with classical waves we defined the intensity as the mean over time of the square of the wave amplitude, and we used complex numbers as a mathematical trick to simplify the analysis."
6726,But in quantum mechanics it turns out that the amplitudes must be represented by complex numbers.
6727,The real parts alone will not do.
6728,"That is a technical point, for the moment, because the formulas look just the same."
6729,But there are a large number of subtleties involved in the fact that nature does work this way.
6730,We would like to illustrate some of these subtleties for you now.
6731,But that conclusion can be tested by another experiment.
6732,We shall now try the following experiment.
6733,"To our electron apparatus we add a very strong light source, placed behind the wall and between the two holes, as shown in Fig."
6734,37–4.
6735,We know that electric charges scatter light.
6736,"So when an electron passes, however it does pass, on its way to the detector, it will scatter some light to our eye, and we can see where the electron goes."
6737,"If it should happen that we get light from both places at the same time, because the electron divides in half … Let us just do the experiment!"
6738,And we observe the same result no matter where we put the detector.
6739,From this observation we conclude that when we look at the electrons we find that the electrons go either through one hole or the other.
6740,"Experimentally, Proposition A is necessarily true."
6741,"What, then, is wrong with our argument against Proposition A?"
6742,Back to experiment!
6743,Let us keep track of the electrons and find out what they are doing.
6744,37–4.
6745,"Well, that is not too surprising!"
6746,So there is not any complicated business like going through both holes.
6747,"When we watch them, the electrons come through just as we would expect them to come through."
6748,But wait!
6749,"What do we have now for the total probability, the probability that an electron will arrive at the detector by any route?"
6750,We already have that information.
6751,"We just pretend that we never looked at the light flashes, and we lump together the detector clicks which we have separated into the two columns."
6752,We must just add the numbers.
6753,We must conclude that when we look at the electrons the distribution of them on the screen is different than when we do not look.
6754,Perhaps it is turning on our light source that disturbs things?
6755,"It must be that the electrons are very delicate, and the light, when it scatters off the electrons, gives them a jolt that changes their motion."
6756,We know that the electric field of the light acting on a charge will exert a force on it.
6757,So perhaps we should expect the motion to be changed.
6758,"Anyway, the light exerts a big influence on the electrons."
6759,By trying to “watch” the electrons we have changed their motions.
6760,You may be thinking: “Don’t use such a bright source!
6761,Turn the brightness down!
6762,The light waves will then be weaker and will not disturb the electrons so much.
6763,"Surely, by making the light dimmer and dimmer, eventually the wave will be weak enough that it will have a negligible effect.” O.K."
6764,Let’s try it.
6765,The first thing we observe is that the flashes of light scattered from the electrons as they pass by does not get weaker.
6766,It is always the same-sized flash.
6767,The only thing that happens as the light is made dimmer is that sometimes we hear a “click” from the detector but see no flash at all.
6768,"The electron has gone by without being “seen.” What we are observing is that light also acts like electrons, we knew that it was “wavy,” but now we find that it is also “lumpy.” It always arrives—or is scattered—in lumps that we call “photons.” As we turn down the intensity of the light source we do not change the size of the photons, only the rate at which they are emitted."
6769,"That explains why, when our source is dim, some electrons get by without being seen."
6770,There did not happen to be a photon around at the time the electron went through.
6771,This is all a little discouraging.
6772,"If it is true that whenever we “see” the electron we see the same-sized flash, then those electrons we see are always the disturbed ones."
6773,Let us try the experiment with a dim light anyway.
6774,37–3!
6775,"If the electrons are not seen, we have interference!"
6776,That is understandable.
6777,"When we do not see the electron, no photon disturbs it, and when we do see it, a photon has disturbed it."
6778,There is always the same amount of disturbance because the light photons all produce the same-sized effects and the effect of the photons being scattered is enough to smear out any interference effect.
6779,Is there not some way we can see the electrons without disturbing them?
6780,Certainly the jolt given to the electron when the photon is scattered toward our eye depends on the momentum that photon carries.
6781,Aha!
6782,"If we want to disturb the electrons only slightly we should not have lowered the intensity of the light, we should have lowered its frequency (the same as increasing its wavelength)."
6783,Let us use light of a redder color.
6784,"We could even use infrared light, or radiowaves (like radar), and “see” where the electron went with the help of some equipment that can “see” light of these longer wavelengths."
6785,If we use “gentler” light perhaps we can avoid disturbing the electrons so much.
6786,Let us try the experiment with longer waves.
6787,"We shall keep repeating our experiment, each time with light of a longer wavelength."
6788,"At first, nothing seems to change."
6789,The results are the same.
6790,Then a terrible thing happens.
6791,"You remember that when we discussed the microscope we pointed out that, due to the wave nature of the light, there is a limitation on how close two spots can be and still be seen as two separate spots."
6792,This distance is of the order of the wavelength of light.
6793,"So now, when we make the wavelength longer than the distance between our holes, we see a big fuzzy flash when the light is scattered by the electrons."
6794,We can no longer tell which hole the electron went through!
6795,We just know it went somewhere!
6796,37–3.
6797,"In our experiment we find that it is impossible to arrange the light in such a way that one can tell which hole the electron went through, and at the same time not disturb the pattern."
6798,It was suggested by Heisenberg that the then new laws of nature could only be consistent if there were some basic limitation on our experimental capabilities not previously recognized.
6799,"He proposed, as a general principle, his uncertainty principle, which we can state in terms of our experiment as follows: “It is impossible to design an apparatus to determine which hole the electron passes through, that will not at the same time disturb the electrons enough to destroy the interference pattern.” If an apparatus is capable of determining which hole the electron goes through, it cannot be so delicate that it does not disturb the pattern in an essential way."
6800,No one has ever found (or even thought of) a way around the uncertainty principle.
6801,So we must assume that it describes a basic characteristic of nature.
6802,"The complete theory of quantum mechanics which we now use to describe atoms and, in fact, all matter depends on the correctness of the uncertainty principle."
6803,"Since quantum mechanics is such a successful theory, our belief in the uncertainty principle is reinforced."
6804,"But if a way to “beat” the uncertainty principle were ever discovered, quantum mechanics would give inconsistent results and would have to be discarded as a valid theory of nature."
6805,"“Well,” you say, “what about Proposition A?"
6806,What we must say (to avoid making wrong predictions) is the following.
6807,"If one does say that, and starts to make any deductions from the statement, he will make errors in the analysis."
6808,This is the logical tightrope on which we must walk if we wish to describe nature successfully.
6809,"If the motion of all matter—as well as electrons—must be described in terms of waves, what about the bullets in our first experiment?"
6810,Why didn’t we see an interference pattern there?
6811,It turns out that for the bullets the wavelengths were so tiny that the interference patterns became very fine.
6812,"So fine, in fact, that with any detector of finite size one could not distinguish the separate maxima and minima."
6813,"What we saw was only a kind of average, which is the classical curve."
6814,In Fig.
6815,37–5 we have tried to indicate schematically what happens with large-scale objects.
6816,"Part (a) of the figure shows the probability distribution one might predict for bullets, using quantum mechanics."
6817,The rapid wiggles are supposed to represent the interference pattern one gets for waves of very short wavelength.
6818,"Any physical detector, however, straddles several wiggles of the probability curve, so that the measurements show the smooth curve drawn in part (b) of the figure."
6819,We will now write a summary of the main conclusions of our experiments.
6820,"We will, however, put the results in a form which makes them true for a general class of such experiments."
6821,"We can write our summary more simply if we first define an “ideal experiment” as one in which there are no uncertain external influences, i.e., no jiggling or other things going on that we cannot take into account."
6822,"We would be quite precise if we said: “An ideal experiment is one in which all of the initial and final conditions of the experiment are completely specified.” What we will call “an event” is, in general, just a specific set of initial and final conditions."
6823,"(For example: “an electron leaves the gun, arrives at the detector, and nothing else happens.”) Now for our summary."
6824,Summary
6825,One might still like to ask: “How does it work?
6826,What is the machinery behind the law?” No one has found any machinery behind the law.
6827,No one can “explain” any more than we have just “explained.” No one will give you any deeper representation of the situation.
6828,We have no ideas about a more basic mechanism from which these results can be deduced.
6829,We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics.
6830,We have been talking about the probability that an electron will arrive in a given circumstance.
6831,We have implied that in our experimental arrangement (or even in the best possible one) it would be impossible to predict exactly what would happen.
6832,We can only predict the odds!
6833,"This would mean, if it were true, that physics has given up on the problem of trying to predict exactly what will happen in a definite circumstance."
6834,Yes!
6835,physics has given up.
6836,"We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance, and we believe now that it is impossible, that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events."
6837,It must be recognized that this is a retrenchment in our earlier ideal of understanding nature.
6838,"It may be a backward step, but no one has seen a way to avoid it."
6839,We make now a few remarks on a suggestion that has sometimes been made to try to avoid the description we have given: “Perhaps the electron has some kind of internal works—some inner variables—that we do not yet know about.
6840,Perhaps that is why we cannot predict what will happen.
6841,"If we could look more closely at the electron we could be able to tell where it would end up.” So far as we know, that is impossible."
6842,We would still be in difficulty.
6843,Suppose we were to assume that inside the electron there is some kind of machinery that determines where it is going to end up.
6844,That machine must also determine which hole it is going to go through on its way.
6845,"But we must not forget that what is inside the electron should not be dependent on what we do, and in particular upon whether we open or close one of the holes."
6846,There seems to be no way around this.
6847,But we have verified experimentally that that is not the case.
6848,And no one has figured a way out of this puzzle.
6849,So at the present time we must limit ourselves to computing probabilities.
6850,"We say “at the present time,” but we suspect very strongly that it is something that will be with us forever—that it is impossible to beat that puzzle—that this is the way nature really is."
6851,The uncertainties in the position and momentum at any instant must have their product greater than or equal to half the reduced Planck constant.
6852,This is a special case of the uncertainty principle that was stated above more generally.
6853,"The more general statement was that one cannot design equipment in any way to determine which of two alternatives is taken, without, at the same time, destroying the pattern of interference."
6854,Let us show for one particular case that the kind of relation given by Heisenberg must be true in order to keep from getting into trouble.
6855,We imagine a modification of the experiment of Fig.
6856,37–6.
6857,By watching the motion of the plate carefully we can try to tell which hole an electron goes through.
6858,"Since the vertical component of the electron momentum is changed, the plate must recoil with an equal momentum in the opposite direction."
6859,The plate will get an upward kick.
6860,"If the electron goes through the lower hole, the plate should feel a downward kick."
6861,So!
6862,"Without disturbing the electrons at all, but just by watching the plate, we can tell which path the electron used."
6863,"Now in order to do this it is necessary to know what the momentum of the screen is, before the electron goes through."
6864,"So when we measure the momentum after the electron goes by, we can figure out how much the plate’s momentum has changed."
6865,"But remember, according to the uncertainty principle we cannot at the same time know the position of the plate with an arbitrary accuracy."
6866,But if we do not know exactly where the plate is we cannot say precisely where the two holes are.
6867,They will be in a different place for every electron that goes through.
6868,This means that the center of our interference pattern will have a different location for each electron.
6869,The wiggles of the interference pattern will be smeared out.
6870,Such a random shift is just enough to smear out the pattern so that no interference is observed.
6871,The uncertainty principle “protects” quantum mechanics.
6872,"Heisenberg recognized that if it were possible to measure the momentum and the position simultaneously with a greater accuracy, the quantum mechanics would collapse."
6873,So he proposed that it must be impossible.
6874,"Then people sat down and tried to figure out ways of doing it, and nobody could figure out a way to measure the position and the momentum of anything—a screen, an electron, a billiard ball, anything—with any greater accuracy."
6875,Quantum mechanics maintains its perilous but accurate existence.
6876,In this chapter we shall discuss the relationship of the wave and particle viewpoints.
6877,"We already know, from the last chapter, that neither the wave viewpoint nor the particle viewpoint is correct."
6878,"Usually we have tried to present things accurately, or at least precisely enough that they will not have to be changed when we learn more—it may be extended, but it will not be changed!"
6879,"But when we try to talk about the wave picture or the particle picture, both are approximate, and both will change."
6880,"Therefore what we learn in this chapter will not be accurate in a certain sense; it is a kind of half-intuitive argument that will be made more precise later, but certain things will be changed a little bit when we interpret them correctly in quantum mechanics."
6881,"The reason for doing such a thing, of course, is that we are not going to go directly into quantum mechanics, but we want to have at least some idea of the kinds of effects that we will find."
6882,"Furthermore, all our experiences are with waves and with particles, and so it is rather handy to use the wave and particle ideas to get some understanding of what happens in given circumstances before we know the complete mathematics of the quantum-mechanical amplitudes."
6883,"We shall try to illustrate the weakest places as we go along, but most of it is very nearly correct—it is just a matter of interpretation."
6884,"First of all, we know that the new way of representing the world in quantum mechanics—the new framework—is to give an amplitude for every event that can occur, and if the event involves the reception of one particle then we can give the amplitude to find that one particle at different places and at different times."
6885,The probability of finding the particle is then proportional to the absolute square of the amplitude.
6886,"In general, the amplitude to find a particle in different places at different times varies with position and time."
6887,This means that the idea of a particle is limited.
6888,"The idea of a particle—its location, its momentum, etc.—which we use so much, is in certain ways unsatisfactory."
6889,That means we do not know where it is—it can be anywhere—there is a great uncertainty in its location.
6890,"Outside this region, the probability is zero."
6891,"38–1), and the wavelength (the distance between nodes of the waves in the train) of that wave train is what corresponds to the particle momentum."
6892,Here we encounter a strange thing about waves; a very simple thing which has nothing to do with quantum mechanics strictly.
6893,"It is something that anybody who works with waves, even if he knows no quantum mechanics, knows: namely, we cannot define a unique wavelength for a short wave train."
6894,"Such a wave train does not have a definite wavelength; there is an indefiniteness in the wave number that is related to the finite length of the train, and thus there is an indefiniteness in the momentum."
6895,"Let us consider two examples of this idea—to see the reason why there is an uncertainty in the position and/or the momentum, if quantum mechanics is right."
6896,"We have also seen before that if there were not such a thing—if it were possible to measure the position and the momentum of anything simultaneously—we would have a paradox; it is fortunate that we do not have such a paradox, and the fact that such an uncertainty comes naturally from the wave picture shows that everything is mutually consistent."
6897,Here is one example which shows the relationship between the position and the momentum in a circumstance that is easy to understand.
6898,"Suppose we have a single slit, and particles are coming from very far away with a certain energy—so that they are all coming essentially horizontally (Fig."
6899,38–2).
6900,We are going to concentrate on the vertical components of momentum.
6901,"The particle is moving neither up nor down, because it came from a source that is far away—and so the vertical momentum is of course zero."
6902,"We once knew the momentum was horizontal, but we do not know it any more."
6903,"Before the particles passed through the hole, we did not know their vertical positions."
6904,"Now that we have found the vertical position by having the particle come through the hole, we have lost our information on the vertical momentum!"
6905,Why?
6906,"According to the wave theory, there is a spreading out, or diffraction, of the waves after they go through the slit, just as for light."
6907,Therefore there is a certain probability that particles coming out of the slit are not coming exactly straight.
6908,"The pattern is spread out by the diffraction effect, and the angle of spread, which we can define as the angle of the first minimum, is a measure of the uncertainty in the final angle."
6909,How does the pattern become spread?
6910,"To say it is spread means that there is some chance for the particle to be moving up or down, that is, to have a component of momentum up or down."
6911,"Remember, when we closed the slits on the experiment with the microwaves, we had more intensity farther out."
6912,"So the narrower we make the slit, the wider the pattern gets, and the more is the likelihood that we would find that the particle has sidewise momentum."
6913,Sometimes people say quantum mechanics is all wrong.
6914,"When the particle arrived from the left, its vertical momentum was zero."
6915,"And now that it has gone through the slit, its position is known."
6916,Both position and momentum seem to be known with arbitrary accuracy.
6917,"It is quite true that we can receive a particle, and on reception determine what its position is and what its momentum would have had to have been to have gotten there."
6918,"That is true, but that is not what the uncertainty relation (38.3) refers to."
6919,"Equation (38.3) refers to the predictability of a situation, not remarks about the past."
6920,"It does no good to say “I knew what the momentum was before it went through the slit, and now I know the position,” because now the momentum knowledge is lost."
6921,The fact that it went through the slit no longer permits us to predict the vertical momentum.
6922,"We are talking about a predictive theory, not just measurements after the fact."
6923,So we must talk about what we can predict.
6924,Now let us take the thing the other way around.
6925,"Let us take another example of the same phenomenon, a little more quantitatively."
6926,In the previous example we measured the momentum by a classical method.
6927,"Namely, we considered the direction and the velocity and the angles, etc., so we got the momentum by classical analysis."
6928,"But since momentum is related to wave number, there exists in nature still another way to measure the momentum of a particle—photon or otherwise—which has no classical analog, because it uses Eq."
6929,(38.2).
6930,We measure the wavelengths of the waves.
6931,Let us try to measure momentum in this way.
6932,Suppose we have a grating with a large number of lines (Fig.
6933,"38–3), and send a beam of particles at the grating."
6934,"We have often discussed this problem: if the particles have a definite momentum, then we get a very sharp pattern in a certain direction, because of the interference."
6935,"And we have also talked about how accurately we can determine that momentum, that is to say, what the resolving power of such a grating is."
6936,38–3.
6937,"This distance is the difference between the total distance that the particle or wave or whatever it is has to travel if it is reflected from the bottom of the grating, and the distance that it has to travel if it is reflected from the top of the grating."
6938,"That is, the waves which form the diffraction pattern are waves which come from different parts of the grating."
6939,If the wave train is too short we are not using the entire grating.
6940,"The waves which form the spectrum are being reflected from only a very short sector of the grating if the wave train is too short, and the grating will not work right—we will find a big angular spread."
6941,"In order to get a narrower one, we need to use the whole grating, so that at least at some moment the whole wave train is scattering simultaneously from all parts of the grating."
6942,It has nothing to do with quantum mechanics.
6943,"It is simply that if we have a finite train, we cannot count the waves in it very precisely."
6944,Let us try another way to see the reason for that.
6945,"This, then, is a limitation of the classical idea of momentum."
6946,"(Naturally, it has to be limited in some ways if we are going to represent particles by waves!)"
6947,It is nice that we have found a rule that gives us some idea of when there is a failure of classical ideas.
6948,Next let us consider the reflection of particle waves from a crystal.
6949,A crystal is a thick thing which has a whole lot of similar atoms—we will include some complications later—in a nice array.
6950,"The question is how to set the array so that we get a strong reflected maximum in a given direction for a given beam of, say, light (x-rays), electrons, neutrons, or anything else."
6951,"In order to obtain a strong reflection, the scattering from all of the atoms must be in phase."
6952,"There cannot be equal numbers in phase and out of phase, or the waves will cancel out."
6953,"The way to arrange things is to find the regions of constant phase, as we have already explained; they are planes which make equal angles with the initial and final directions (Fig."
6954,38–4).
6955,"If we consider two parallel planes, as in Fig."
6956,"38–4, the waves scattered from the two planes will be in phase provided the difference in distance travelled by a wavefront is an integral number of wavelengths."
6957,"If, on the other hand, there are other atoms of the same nature (equal in density) halfway between, then the intermediate planes will also scatter equally strongly and will interfere with the others and produce no effect."
6958,"As a matter of interest, actual crystals are not usually as simple as a single kind of atom repeated in a certain way."
6959,"Instead; if we make a two-dimensional analog, they are much like wallpaper, in which there is some kind of figure which repeats all over the wallpaper."
6960,"By “figure” we mean, in the case of atoms, some arrangement—calcium and a carbon and three oxygens, etc., for calcium carbonate, and so on—which may involve a relatively large number of atoms."
6961,"But whatever it is, the figure is repeated in a pattern."
6962,This basic figure is called a unit cell.
6963,The basic pattern of repetition defines what we call the lattice type; the lattice type can be immediately determined by looking at the reflections and seeing what their symmetry is.
6964,"In other words, where we find any reflections at all determines the lattice type, but in order to determine what is in each of the elements of the lattice one must take into account the intensity of the scattering at the various directions."
6965,"Which directions scatter depends on the type of lattice, but how strongly each scatters is determined by what is inside each unit cell, and in that way the structure of crystals is worked out."
6966,Two photographs of x-ray diffraction patterns are shown in Figs.
6967,"38–5 and 38–6; they illustrate scattering from rock salt and myoglobin, respectively."
6968,"This fact also has an interesting consequence in the case of piles which make neutrons (these are obviously particles, for anybody’s money!)."
6969,"If we take these neutrons and let them into a long block of graphite, the neutrons diffuse and work their way along (Fig."
6970,38–7).
6971,"They diffuse because they are bounced by the atoms, but strictly, in the wave theory, they are bounced by the atoms because of diffraction from the crystal planes."
6972,"It turns out that if we take a very long piece of graphite, the neutrons that come out the far end are all of long wavelength!"
6973,"In fact, if one plots the intensity as a function of wavelength, we get nothing except for wavelengths longer than a certain minimum (Fig."
6974,38–8).
6975,"In other words, we can get very slow neutrons that way."
6976,"Only the slowest neutrons come through; they are not diffracted or scattered by the crystal planes of the graphite, but keep going right through like light through glass, and are not scattered out the sides."
6977,There are many other demonstrations of the reality of neutron waves and waves of other particles.
6978,"We now consider another application of the uncertainty relation, Eq."
6979,(38.3).
6980,It must not be taken too seriously; the idea is right but the analysis is not very accurate.
6981,"The idea has to do with the determination of the size of atoms, and the fact that, classically, the electrons would radiate light and spiral in until they settle down right on top of the nucleus."
6982,But that cannot be right quantum-mechanically because then we would know where each electron was and how fast it was moving.
6983,"Suppose we have a hydrogen atom, and measure the position of the electron; we must not be able to predict exactly where the electron will be, or the momentum spread will then turn out to be infinite."
6984,"Every time we look at the electron, it is somewhere, but it has an amplitude to be in different places so there is a probability of it being found in different places."
6985,"Atoms are completely impossible from the classical point of view, since the electrons would spiral into the nucleus."
6986,It means that the electron has less energy when it is in the atom than when it is free.
6987,It means it is bound.
6988,"However, we have cheated, we have used all the constants in such a way that it happens to come out the right number!"
6989,So we now understand why we do not fall through the floor.
6990,"As we walk, our shoes with their masses of atoms push against the floor with its mass of atoms."
6991,"In order to squash the atoms closer together, the electrons would be confined to a smaller space and, by the uncertainty principle, their momenta would have to be higher on the average, and that means high energy; the resistance to atomic compression is a quantum-mechanical effect and not a classical effect."
6992,"Classically, we would expect that if we were to draw all the electrons and protons closer together, the energy would be reduced still further, and the best arrangement of positive and negative charges in classical physics is all on top of each other."
6993,This was well known in classical physics and was a puzzle because of the existence of the atom.
6994,"Of course, the early scientists invented some ways out of the trouble—but never mind, we have the right way out, now!"
6995,(Maybe.)
6996,"Incidentally, although we have no reason to understand it at the moment, in a situation where there are many electrons it turns out that they try to keep away from each other."
6997,"If one electron is occupying a certain space, then another does not occupy the same space."
6998,"More precisely, there are two spin cases, so that two can sit on top of each other, one spinning one way and one the other way."
6999,But after that we cannot put any more there.
7000,"We have to put others in another place, and that is the real reason that matter has strength."
7001,If we could put all the electrons in the same place it would condense even more than it does.
7002,It is the fact that the electrons cannot all get on top of each other that makes tables and everything else solid.
7003,"Obviously, in order to understand the properties of matter, we will have to use quantum mechanics and not be satisfied with classical mechanics."
7004,"We have talked about the atom in its lowest possible energy condition, but it turns out that the electron can do other things."
7005,"It can jiggle and wiggle in a more energetic manner, and so there are many different possible motions for the atom."
7006,"According to quantum mechanics, in a stationary condition there can only be definite energies for an atom."
7007,We make a diagram (Fig.
7008,"38–9) in which we plot the energy vertically, and we make a horizontal line for each allowed value of the energy."
7009,"When the electron is free, i.e., when its energy is positive, it can have any energy; it can be moving at any speed."
7010,But bound energies are not arbitrary.
7011,"The atom must have one or another out of a set of allowed values, such as those in Fig."
7012,38–9.
7013,Sooner or later it drops to a lower state and radiates energy in the form of light.
7014,The frequency of the light that is emitted is determined by conservation of energy plus the quantum-mechanical understanding that the frequency of the light is related to the energy of the light by (38.1).
7015,"This remarkable coincidence in spectral frequencies was noted before quantum mechanics was discovered, and it is called the Ritz combination principle."
7016,This is again a mystery from the point of view of classical mechanics.
7017,Let us not belabor the point that classical mechanics is a failure in the atomic domain; we seem to have demonstrated that pretty well.
7018,"We have already talked about quantum mechanics as being represented by amplitudes which behave like waves, with certain frequencies and wave numbers."
7019,Let us observe how it comes about from the point of view of amplitudes that the atom has definite energy states.
7020,"This is something we cannot understand from what has been said so far, but we are all familiar with the fact that confined waves have definite frequencies."
7021,"For instance, if sound is confined to an organ pipe, or anything like that, then there is more than one way that the sound can vibrate, but for each such way there is a definite frequency."
7022,Thus an object in which the waves are confined has certain resonance frequencies.
7023,It is therefore a property of waves in a confined space—a subject which we will discuss in detail with formulas later on—that they exist only at definite frequencies.
7024,"And since the general relation exists between frequencies of the amplitude and energy, we are not surprised to find definite energies associated with electrons bound in atoms."
7025,Let us consider briefly some philosophical implications of quantum mechanics.
7026,"As always, there are two aspects of the problem: one is the philosophical implication for physics, and the other is the extrapolation of philosophical matters to other fields."
7027,"When philosophical ideas associated with science are dragged into another field, they are usually completely distorted."
7028,Therefore we shall confine our remarks as much as possible to physics itself.
7029,"First of all, the most interesting aspect is the idea of the uncertainty principle; making an observation affects the phenomenon."
7030,"It has always been known that making observations affects a phenomenon, but the point is that the effect cannot be disregarded or minimized or decreased arbitrarily by rearranging the apparatus."
7031,"When we look for a certain phenomenon we cannot help but disturb it in a certain minimum way, and the disturbance is necessary for the consistency of the viewpoint."
7032,"The observer was sometimes important in prequantum physics, but only in a rather trivial sense."
7033,"The problem has been raised: if a tree falls in a forest and there is nobody there to hear it, does it make a noise?"
7034,"A real tree falling in a real forest makes a sound, of course, even if nobody is there."
7035,"Even if no one is present to hear it, there are other traces left."
7036,"The sound will shake some leaves, and if we were careful enough we might find somewhere that some thorn had rubbed against a leaf and made a tiny scratch that could not be explained unless we assumed the leaf were vibrating."
7037,So in a certain sense we would have to admit that there is a sound made.
7038,We might ask: was there a sensation of sound?
7039,"No, sensations have to do, presumably, with consciousness."
7040,"And whether ants are conscious and whether there were ants in the forest, or whether the tree was conscious, we do not know."
7041,Let us leave the problem in that form.
7042,Another thing that people have emphasized since quantum mechanics was developed is the idea that we should not speak about those things which we cannot measure.
7043,(Actually relativity theory also said this.)
7044,"Unless a thing can be defined by measurement, it has no place in a theory."
7045,And since an accurate value of the momentum of a localized particle cannot be defined by measurement it therefore has no place in the theory.
7046,The idea that this is what was the matter with classical theory is a false position.
7047,It is a careless analysis of the situation.
7048,Just because we cannot measure position and momentum precisely does not a priori mean that we cannot talk about them.
7049,It only means that we need not talk about them.
7050,The situation in the sciences is this: A concept or an idea which cannot be measured or cannot be referred directly to experiment may or may not be useful.
7051,It need not exist in a theory.
7052,"In other words, suppose we compare the classical theory of the world with the quantum theory of the world, and suppose that it is true experimentally that we can measure position and momentum only imprecisely."
7053,The question is whether the ideas of the exact position of a particle and the exact momentum of a particle are valid or not.
7054,The classical theory admits the ideas; the quantum theory does not.
7055,This does not in itself mean that classical physics is wrong.
7056,"When the new quantum mechanics was discovered, the classical people—which included everybody except Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and Born—said: “Look, your theory is not any good because you cannot answer certain questions like: what is the exact position of a particle?, which hole does it go through?, and some others.” Heisenberg’s answer was: “I do not need to answer such questions because you cannot ask such a question experimentally.” It is that we do not have to."
7057,"Consider two theories (a) and (b); (a) contains an idea that cannot be checked directly but which is used in the analysis, and the other, (b), does not contain the idea."
7058,"If they disagree in their predictions, one could not claim that (b) is false because it cannot explain this idea that is in (a), because that idea is one of the things that cannot be checked directly."
7059,"It is always good to know which ideas cannot be checked directly, but it is not necessary to remove them all."
7060,It is not true that we can pursue science completely by using only those concepts which are directly subject to experiment.
7061,"In quantum mechanics itself there is a wave function amplitude, there is a potential, and there are many constructs that we cannot measure directly."
7062,The basis of a science is its ability to predict.
7063,To predict means to tell what will happen in an experiment that has never been done.
7064,How can we do that?
7065,"By assuming that we know what is there, independent of the experiment."
7066,We must extrapolate the experiments to a region where they have not been done.
7067,We must take our concepts and extend them to places where they have not yet been checked.
7068,"If we do not do that, we have no prediction."
7069,So it was perfectly sensible for the classical physicists to go happily along and suppose that the position—which obviously means something for a baseball—meant something also for an electron.
7070,It was not stupidity.
7071,It was a sensible procedure.
7072,"Today we say that the law of relativity is supposed to be true at all energies, but someday somebody may come along and say how stupid we were."
7073,"We do not know where we are “stupid” until we “stick our neck out,” and so the whole idea is to put our neck out."
7074,And the only way to find out that we are wrong is to find out what our predictions are.
7075,It is absolutely necessary to make constructs.
7076,We have already made a few remarks about the indeterminacy of quantum mechanics.
7077,"That is, that we are unable now to predict what will happen in physics in a given physical circumstance which is arranged as carefully as possible."
7078,"If we have an atom that is in an excited state and so is going to emit a photon, we cannot say when it will emit the photon."
7079,"It has a certain amplitude to emit the photon at any time, and we can predict only a probability for emission; we cannot predict the future exactly."
7080,"This has given rise to all kinds of nonsense and questions on the meaning of freedom of will, and of the idea that the world is uncertain."
7081,"Of course we must emphasize that classical physics is also indeterminate, in a sense."
7082,"It is usually thought that this indeterminacy, that we cannot predict the future, is an important quantum-mechanical thing, and this is said to explain the behavior of the mind, feelings of free will, etc."
7083,But if the world were classical—if the laws of mechanics were classical—it is not quite obvious that the mind would not feel more or less the same.
7084,"It is true classically that if we knew the position and the velocity of every particle in the world, or in a box of gas, we could predict exactly what would happen."
7085,And therefore the classical world is deterministic.
7086,"Suppose, however, that we have a finite accuracy and do not know exactly where just one atom is, say to one part in a billion."
7087,"Then as it goes along it hits another atom, and because we did not know the position better than to one part in a billion, we find an even larger error in the position after the collision."
7088,"And that is amplified, of course, in the next collision, so that if we start with only a tiny error it rapidly magnifies to a very great uncertainty."
7089,"To give an example: if water falls over a dam, it splashes."
7090,"If we stand nearby, every now and then a drop will land on our nose."
7091,"This appears to be completely random, yet such a behavior would be predicted by purely classical laws."
7092,The exact position of all the drops depends upon the precise wigglings of the water before it goes over the dam.
7093,How?
7094,"The tiniest irregularities are magnified in falling, so that we get complete randomness."
7095,"Obviously, we cannot really predict the position of the drops unless we know the motion of the water absolutely exactly."
7096,"Speaking more precisely, given an arbitrary accuracy, no matter how precise, one can find a time long enough that we cannot make predictions valid for that long a time."
7097,Now the point is that this length of time is not very large.
7098,It is not that the time is millions of years if the accuracy is one part in a billion.
7099,"The time goes, in fact, only logarithmically with the error, and it turns out that in only a very, very tiny time we lose all our information."
7100,"If the accuracy is taken to be one part in billions and billions and billions—no matter how many billions we wish, provided we do stop somewhere—then we can find a time less than the time it took to state the accuracy—after which we can no longer predict what is going to happen!"
7101,"It is therefore not fair to say that from the apparent freedom and indeterminacy of the human mind, we should have realized that classical “deterministic” physics could not ever hope to understand it, and to welcome quantum mechanics as a release from a “completely mechanistic” universe."
7102,For already in classical mechanics there was indeterminability from a practical point of view.
7103,With this chapter we begin a new subject which will occupy us for some time.
7104,"It is the first part of the analysis of the properties of matter from the physical point of view, in which, recognizing that matter is made out of a great many atoms, or elementary parts, which interact electrically and obey the laws of mechanics, we try to understand why various aggregates of atoms behave the way they do."
7105,"It is obvious that this is a difficult subject, and we emphasize at the beginning that it is in fact an extremely difficult subject, and that we have to deal with it differently than we have dealt with the other subjects so far."
7106,"In the case of mechanics and in the case of light, we were able to begin with a precise statement of some laws, like Newton’s laws, or the formula for the field produced by an accelerating charge, from which a whole host of phenomena could be essentially understood, and which would produce a basis for our understanding of mechanics and of light from that time on."
7107,"That is, we may learn more later, but we do not learn different physics, we only learn better methods of mathematical analysis to deal with the situation."
7108,We cannot use this approach effectively in studying the properties of matter.
7109,"We can discuss matter only in a most elementary way; it is much too complicated a subject to analyze directly from its specific basic laws, which are none other than the laws of mechanics and electricity."
7110,"But these are a bit too far away from the properties we wish to study; it takes too many steps to get from Newton’s laws to the properties of matter, and these steps are, in themselves, fairly complicated."
7111,"We will now start to take some of these steps, but while many of our analyses will be quite accurate, they will eventually get less and less accurate."
7112,We will have only a rough understanding of the properties of matter.
7113,"One of the reasons that we have to perform the analysis so imperfectly is that the mathematics of it requires a deep understanding of the theory of probability; we are not going to want to know where every atom is actually moving, but rather, how many move here and there on the average, and what the odds are for different effects."
7114,"So this subject involves a knowledge of the theory of probability, and our mathematics is not yet quite ready and we do not want to strain it too hard."
7115,"Secondly, and more important from a physical standpoint, the actual behavior of the atoms is not according to classical mechanics, but according to quantum mechanics, and a correct understanding of the subject cannot be attained until we understand quantum mechanics."
7116,"Here, unlike the case of billiard balls and automobiles, the difference between the classical mechanical laws and the quantum-mechanical laws is very important and very significant, so that many things that we will deduce by classical physics will be fundamentally incorrect."
7117,"Therefore there will be certain things to be partially unlearned; however, we shall indicate in every case when a result is incorrect, so that we will know just where the “edges” are."
7118,"One of the reasons for discussing quantum mechanics in the preceding chapters was to give an idea as to why, more or less, classical mechanics is incorrect in the various directions."
7119,Why do we deal with the subject now at all?
7120,"Why not wait half a year, or a year, until we know the mathematics of probability better, and we learn a little quantum mechanics, and then we can do it in a more fundamental way?"
7121,"The answer is that it is a difficult subject, and the best way to learn is to do it slowly!"
7122,"The first thing to do is to get some idea, more or less, of what ought to happen in different circumstances, and then, later, when we know the laws better, we will formulate them better."
7123,Anyone who wants to analyze the properties of matter in a real problem might want to start by writing down the fundamental equations and then try to solve them mathematically.
7124,"Although there are people who try to use such an approach, these people are the failures in this field; the real successes come to those who start from a physical point of view, people who have a rough idea where they are going and then begin by making the right kind of approximations, knowing what is big and what is small in a given complicated situation."
7125,"These problems are so complicated that even an elementary understanding, although inaccurate and incomplete, is worthwhile having, and so the subject will be one that we shall go over again and again, each time with more and more accuracy, as we go through our course in physics."
7126,"Another reason for beginning the subject right now is that we have already used many of these ideas in, for example, chemistry, and we have even heard of some of them in high school."
7127,It is interesting to know the physical basis for these things.
7128,"As an interesting example, we all know that equal volumes of gases, at the same pressure and temperature, contain the same number of molecules."
7129,"The law of multiple proportions, that when two gases combine in a chemical reaction the volumes needed always stand in simple integral proportions, was understood ultimately by Avogadro to mean that equal volumes have equal numbers of atoms."
7130,Now why do they have equal numbers of atoms?
7131,Can we deduce from Newton’s laws that the number of atoms should be equal?
7132,We shall address ourselves to that specific matter in this chapter.
7133,"In succeeding chapters, we shall discuss various other phenomena involving pressures, volumes, temperature, and heat."
7134,"We shall also find that the subject can be attacked from a nonatomic point of view, and that there are many interrelationships of the properties of substances."
7135,"For instance, when we compress something, it heats; if we heat it, it expands."
7136,There is a relationship between these two facts which can be deduced independently of the machinery underneath.
7137,This subject is called thermodynamics.
7138,"The deepest understanding of thermodynamics comes, of course, from understanding the actual machinery underneath, and that is what we shall do: we shall take the atomic viewpoint from the beginning and use it to understand the various properties of matter and the laws of thermodynamics."
7139,"Let us, then, discuss the properties of gases from the standpoint of Newton’s laws of mechanics."
7140,"First, we know that a gas exerts a pressure, and we must clearly understand what this is due to."
7141,"If our ears were a few times more sensitive, we would hear a perpetual rushing noise."
7142,"Evolution has not developed the ear to that point, because it would be useless if it were so much more sensitive—we would hear a perpetual racket."
7143,"The reason is that the eardrum is in contact with the air, and air is a lot of molecules in perpetual motion and these bang against the eardrums."
7144,"In banging against the eardrums they make an irregular tattoo—boom, boom, boom—which we do not hear because the atoms are so small, and the sensitivity of the ear is not quite enough to notice it."
7145,"The result of this perpetual bombardment is to push the drum away, but of course there is an equal perpetual bombardment of atoms on the other side of the eardrum, so the net force on it is zero."
7146,"If we were to take the air away from one side, or change the relative amounts of air on the two sides, the eardrum would then be pushed one way or the other, because the amount of bombardment on one side would be greater than on the other."
7147,"We sometimes feel this uncomfortable effect when we go up too fast in an elevator or an airplane, especially if we also have a bad cold (when we have a cold, inflammation closes the tube which connects the air on the inside of the eardrum with the outside air through the throat, so that the two pressures cannot readily equalize)."
7148,"In considering how to analyze the situation quantitatively, we imagine that we have a volume of gas in a box, at one end of which is a piston which can be moved (Fig."
7149,39–1).
7150,We would like to find out what force on the piston results from the fact that there are atoms in this box.
7151,"Suppose there is nothing, a vacuum, on the outside of the piston."
7152,What of it?
7153,"If the piston were left alone, and nobody held onto it, each time it got banged it would pick up a little momentum and it would gradually get pushed out of the box."
7154,"The problem is, how much force?"
7155,"The minus sign is there because, as we compress it, we decrease the volume; if we think about it we can see that if a gas is compressed, work is done on it."
7156,How much force do we have to apply to balance the banging of the molecules?
7157,The piston receives from each collision a certain amount of momentum.
7158,"A certain amount of momentum per second will pour into the piston, and it will start to move."
7159,"To keep it from moving, we must pour back into it the same amount of momentum per second from our force."
7160,"Of course, the force is the amount of momentum per second that we must pour in."
7161,"There is another way to put it: if we let go of the piston it will pick up speed because of the bombardments; with each collision we get a little more speed, and the speed thus accelerates."
7162,"The rate at which the piston picks up speed, or accelerates, is proportional to the force on it."
7163,"So we see that the force, which we already have said is the pressure times the area, is equal to the momentum per second delivered to the piston by the colliding molecules."
7164,"To calculate the momentum per second is easy—we can do it in two parts: first, we find the momentum delivered to the piston by one particular atom in a collision with the piston, then we have to multiply by the number of collisions per second that the atoms have with the wall."
7165,The force will be the product of these two factors.
7166,"Now let us see what the two factors are: In the first place, we shall suppose that the piston is a perfect “reflector” for the atoms."
7167,"If it is not, the whole theory is wrong, and the piston will start to heat up and things will change, but eventually, when equilibrium has set in, the net result is that the collisions are effectively perfectly elastic."
7168,"On the average, every particle that comes in leaves with the same energy."
7169,"So we shall imagine that the gas is in a steady condition, and we lose no energy to the piston because the piston is standing still."
7170,"In those circumstances, if a particle comes in with a certain speed, it comes out with the same speed and, we will say, with the same mass."
7171,How many atoms are hitting?
7172,"Now we notice a little trouble with this analysis: First, all the molecules do not have the same velocity, and they do not move in the same direction."
7173,"No; of all the atoms, only half are headed toward the piston."
7174,"As a very simple example let us take helium gas, or any other gas, like mercury vapor, or potassium vapor of high enough temperature, or argon, in which all the molecules are single atoms, for which we may suppose that there is no internal motion in the atom."
7175,"If we had a complex molecule, there might be some internal motion, mutual vibrations, or something."
7176,"We suppose that we may disregard that; this is actually a serious matter that we will have to come back to, but it turns out to be all right."
7177,"We suppose that the internal motion of the atoms can be disregarded, and therefore, for this purpose, that the kinetic energy of the center-of-mass motion is all the energy there is."
7178,"So for a monatomic gas, the kinetic energy is the total energy."
7179,"Incidentally, we can stop here and find the answer to the following question: Suppose that we take a can of gas and compress the gas slowly, how much pressure do we need to squeeze the volume down?"
7180,"So we are going to have some kind of a differential equation: If we start out in a given circumstance with a certain energy and a certain volume, we then know the pressure."
7181,"So, we have to solve a differential equation, and we will solve it in a moment."
7182,"We must first emphasize, however, that as we are compressing this gas, we are supposing that all the work goes into increasing the energy of the atoms inside."
7183,"We may ask, “Isn’t that necessary?"
7184,Where else could it go?” It turns out that it can go another place.
7185,"There are what we call “heat leaks” through the walls: the hot (i.e., fast-moving) atoms that bombard the walls, heat the walls, and energy goes away."
7186,We shall suppose for the present that this is not the case.
7187,"(The word adiabatic is used in physics in several ways, and it is sometimes hard to see what is common about them.)"
7188,"That is, for an adiabatic compression all the work done goes into changing the internal energy."
7189,"Although we derived it theoretically, this is, in fact, the way monatomic gases behave experimentally."
7190,"We may give one other example of the kinetic theory of a gas, one which is not used in chemistry so much, but is used in astronomy."
7191,We have a large number of photons in a box in which the temperature is very high.
7192,"(The box is, of course, the gas in a very hot star."
7193,"The sun is not hot enough; there are still too many atoms, but at still higher temperatures in certain very hot stars, we may neglect the atoms and suppose that the only objects that we have in the box are photons.)"
7194,"The momentum and the velocity are in the same direction, and the velocity is the speed of light, so this is the momentum of each of the objects, times the speed of light."
7195,"That is what is used in an analysis of the contribution of radiation pressure in a star, that is how we calculate it, and how it changes when we compress it."
7196,What wonderful things are already within our power!
7197,So far we have not dealt with temperature; we have purposely been avoiding the temperature.
7198,"As we compress a gas, we know that the energy of the molecules increases, and we are used to saying that the gas gets hotter; we would like to understand what this has to do with the temperature."
7199,"If we try to do the experiment, not adiabatically but at what we call constant temperature, what are we doing?"
7200,"We know that if we take two boxes of gas and let them sit next to each other long enough, even if at the start they were at what we call different temperatures, they will in the end come to the same temperature."
7201,Now what does that mean?
7202,That means that they get to a condition that they would get to if we left them alone long enough!
7203,What we mean by equal temperature is just that—the final condition when things have been sitting around interacting with each other long enough.
7204,"Let us consider, now, what happens if we have two gases in containers separated by a movable piston as in Fig."
7205,"39–2 (just for simplicity we shall take two monatomic gases, say helium and neon)."
7206,What are the conditions for equilibrium?
7207,"Obviously, the bombardment from the left side must be such that it moves the piston to the right and compresses the other gas until its pressure builds up, and the thing will thus slosh back and forth, and will gradually come to rest at a place where the pressures are equal on both sides."
7208,"What we have to try to prove, eventually, is that the numbers themselves are equal."
7209,"We must realize that this is not the only condition over the long run, but something else must happen more slowly as the true complete equilibrium corresponding to equal temperatures sets in."
7210,"To see the idea, suppose that the pressure on the left side were developed by having a very high density but a low velocity."
7211,"The atoms may be moving slowly but be packed nearly solidly, or there may be fewer but they are hitting harder."
7212,Will it stay like that forever?
7213,"At first we might think so, but then we think again and find we have forgotten one important point."
7214,"That is, that the intermediate piston does not receive a steady pressure; it wiggles, just like the eardrum that we were first talking about, because the bangings are not absolutely uniform."
7215,"There is not a perpetual, steady pressure, but a tattoo—the pressure varies, and so the thing jiggles."
7216,"Suppose that the atoms on the right side are not jiggling much, but those on the left are few and far between and very energetic."
7217,"The piston will, now and then, get a big impulse from the left, and will be driven against the slow atoms on the right, giving them more speed."
7218,"(As each atom collides with the piston, it either gains or loses energy, depending upon whether the piston is moving one way or the other when the atom strikes it.)"
7219,"So, as a result of the collisions, the piston finds itself jiggling, jiggling, jiggling, and this shakes the other gas—it gives energy to the other atoms, and they build up faster motions, until they balance the jiggling that the piston is giving to them."
7220,The system comes to some equilibrium where the piston is moving at such a mean square speed that it picks up energy from the atoms at about the same rate as it puts energy back into them.
7221,"So the piston picks up a certain mean irregularity in speed, and it is our problem to find it."
7222,"When we do find it, we can solve our problem better, because the gases will adjust their velocities until the rate at which they are trying to pour energy into each other through the piston will become equal."
7223,"It is quite difficult to figure out the details of the piston in this particular circumstance; although it is ideally simple to understand, it turns out to be a little harder to analyze."
7224,If all of the No.
7225,If they are all going much faster than the No.
7226,"So when both gases are in the same box, the problem is to find the rule that determines the relative speeds of the two."
7227,"This is still a very difficult problem, but we will solve it as follows."
7228,"First we consider the following sub-problem (again this is one of those cases where—never mind the derivation—in the end the result is very simple to remember, but the derivation is just ingenious)."
7229,"Let us suppose that we have two molecules, of different mass, colliding, and that the collision is viewed in the center-of-mass (CM) system."
7230,"In order to remove a complication, we look at the collision in the CM."
7231,"As we know from the laws of collision, by the conservation of momentum and energy, after the molecules collide the only way they can move is such that each maintains its own original speed—and they just change their direction."
7232,So we have an average collision that looks like that in Fig.
7233,39–3.
7234,"Suppose, for a moment, that we watch all the collisions with the CM at rest."
7235,Suppose we imagine that they are all initially moving horizontally.
7236,"Of course, after the first collision some of them are moving at an angle."
7237,"In other words, if they were all going horizontally, then at least some would later be moving vertically."
7238,"Now in some other collision, they would be coming in from another direction, and then they would be twisted at still another angle."
7239,"So even if they were completely organized in the beginning, they would get sprayed around at all angles, and then the sprayed ones would get sprayed some more, and sprayed some more, and sprayed some more."
7240,"Ultimately, what will be the distribution?"
7241,Answer: It will be equally likely to find any pair moving in any direction in space.
7242,After that further collisions could not change the distribution.
7243,"They are equally likely to go in all directions, but how do we say that?"
7244,"There is of course no likelihood that they will go in any specific direction, because a specific direction is too exact, so we have to talk about per unit “something.” The idea is that any area on a sphere centered at a collision point will have just as many molecules going through it as go through any other equal area on the sphere."
7245,So the result of the collisions will be to distribute the directions so that equal areas on a sphere will have equal probabilities.
7246,32–1).
7247,What happens now?
7248,"If we watch this collision in the CM system, then we see a collision just like that in Fig."
7249,"All this happens while the CM keeps right on moving, without any change."
7250,"Now then, what is the distribution resulting from this?"
7251,"Of course, if there were, the collisions would spray it about, so it is all sprayed around."
7252,"That is, what is the average of the component of velocity of one molecule in the direction of another?"
7253,Surely there is just as much likelihood of finding any given molecule moving one way as another.
7254,That means that the heavy ones will move slower than the light ones; this is easily shown by experimentation with “atoms” of different masses in an air trough.
7255,"Now we would like to go one step further, and say that if we have two different gases separated in a box, they will also have equal average kinetic energy when they have finally come to equilibrium, even though they are not in the same box."
7256,We can make the argument in a number of ways.
7257,One way is to argue that if we have a fixed partition with a tiny hole in it (Fig.
7258,"39–4) so that one gas could leak out through the holes while the other could not, because the molecules are too big, and these had attained equilibrium, then we know that in one part, where they are mixed, they have the same average kinetic energy, but some come through the hole without loss of kinetic energy, so the average kinetic energy in the pure gas and in the mixture must be the same."
7259,"That is not too satisfactory, because maybe there are no holes, for this kind of molecule, that separate one kind from the other."
7260,Let us now go back to the piston problem.
7261,"Although this is not in the middle of the gas, but is on one side of the gas, we can still make the argument, although it is a little more difficult, that the average kinetic energy of the piston and of the gas molecules are equal as a result of all the collisions."
7262,"If this still does not satisfy us, we may make an artificial example by which the equilibrium is generated by an object which can be hit on all sides."
7263,"Suppose that we have a short rod with a ball on each end sticking through the piston, on a frictionless sliding universal joint."
7264,"Each ball is round, like one of the molecules, and can be hit on all sides."
7265,"So, therefore, both sides have to have the same kinetic energy when they are in thermal equilibrium."
7266,"So, although we only proved it for a mixture of gases, it is easily extended to the case where there are two different, separate gases at the same temperature."
7267,"Thus when we have two gases at the same temperature, the mean kinetic energy of the CM motions are equal."
7268,"The mean molecular kinetic energy is a property only of the “temperature.” Being a property of the “temperature,” and not of the gas, we can use it as a definition of the temperature."
7269,The mean kinetic energy of a molecule is thus some function of the temperature.
7270,But who is to tell us what scale to use for the temperature?
7271,We may arbitrarily define the scale of temperature so that the mean energy is linearly proportional to the temperature.
7272,The best way to do it would be to call the mean energy itself “the temperature.” That would be the simplest possible function.
7273,"Unfortunately, the scale of temperature has been chosen differently, so instead of calling it temperature directly we use a constant conversion factor between the energy of a molecule and a degree of absolute temperature called a degree Kelvin."
7274,"Now, of course, we can put our definition of temperature into Eq."
7275,"So equal volumes of different gases, at the same pressure and temperature, have the same number of molecules, because of Newton’s laws."
7276,That is an amazing conclusion!
7277,"In practice, when dealing with molecules, because the numbers are so large, the chemists have artificially chosen a specific number, a very large number, and called it something else."
7278,They have a number which they call a mole.
7279,A mole is merely a handy number.
7280,"We now make one more remark about our gas law, and that has to do with the law for objects other than monatomic molecules."
7281,We have dealt only with the CM motion of the atoms of a monatomic gas.
7282,What happens if there are forces present?
7283,"First, consider the case that the piston is held by a horizontal spring, and there are forces on it."
7284,"The exchange of jiggling motion between atoms and piston at any moment does not depend on where the piston is at that moment, of course."
7285,The equilibrium conditions are the same.
7286,"No matter where the piston is, its speed of motion must be such that it passes energy to the molecules in just the right way."
7287,So it makes no difference about the spring.
7288,"The speed at which the piston has to move, on the average, is the same."
7289,"How can this be, if they are held together?"
7290,"Although they are held together, when they are spinning and turning in there, when something hits them, exchanging energy with them, the only thing that counts is how fast they are moving."
7291,That alone determines how fast they exchange energy in collisions.
7292,"At the particular instant, the force is not an essential point."
7293,"Therefore the same principle is right, even when there are forces."
7294,"Let us prove, finally, that the gas law is consistent also with a disregard of the internal motion."
7295,We did not really include the internal motions before; we just treated a monatomic gas.
7296,(It had better be zero!)
7297,These “independent directions of motion” are sometimes called the degrees of freedom of the system.
7298,"The entire kinetic energy of the molecule can be expressed either as the sum of the kinetic energies of the separate atoms, or as the sum of the kinetic energy of the CM motion plus the kinetic energy of the internal motions."
7299,"The latter can sometimes be expressed as a sum of rotational kinetic energy of the molecule and vibrational energy, but this is an approximation."
7300,We have discussed some of the properties of large numbers of intercolliding atoms.
7301,"The subject is called kinetic theory, a description of matter from the point of view of collisions between the atoms."
7302,"Fundamentally, we assert that the gross properties of matter should be explainable in terms of the motion of its parts."
7303,"We limit ourselves for the present to conditions of thermal equilibrium, that is, to a subclass of all the phenomena of nature."
7304,"The laws of mechanics which apply just to thermal equilibrium are called statistical mechanics, and in this section we want to become acquainted with some of the central theorems of this subject."
7305,That tells us something about the mean square velocities of the atoms.
7306,"Our objective now is to learn more about the positions of the atoms, to discover how many of them are going to be in different places at thermal equilibrium, and also to go into a little more detail on the distribution of the velocities."
7307,"Although we have the mean square velocity, we do not know how to answer a question such as how many of them are going three times faster than the root mean square, or how many of them are going one-quarter of the root mean square speed."
7308,Or have they all the same speed exactly?
7309,"So, these are the two questions that we shall try to answer: How are the molecules distributed in space when there are forces acting on them, and how are they distributed in velocity?"
7310,"It turns out that the two questions are completely independent, and that the distribution of velocities is always the same."
7311,"The distribution of the velocities of the molecules is independent of the forces, because the collision rates do not depend upon the forces."
7312,"Let us begin with an example: the distribution of the molecules in an atmosphere like our own, but without the winds and other kinds of disturbance."
7313,"Suppose that we have a column of gas extending to a great height, and at thermal equilibrium—unlike our atmosphere, which as we know gets colder as we go up."
7314,"We could remark that if the temperature differed at different heights, we could demonstrate lack of equilibrium by connecting a rod to some balls at the bottom (Fig."
7315,"So, ultimately, of course, the temperature becomes the same at all heights in a gravitational field."
7316,"If the temperature is the same at all heights, the problem is to discover by what law the atmosphere becomes tenuous as we go up."
7317,"In other words, if we know the number of molecules per unit volume, we know the pressure, and vice versa: they are proportional to each other, since the temperature is constant in this problem."
7318,"But the pressure is not constant, it must increase as the altitude is reduced, because it has to hold, so to speak, the weight of all the gas above it."
7319,That is the clue by which we may determine how the pressure changes with height.
7320,"Note that if we have different kinds of molecules with different masses, they go down with different exponentials."
7321,The ones which were heavier would decrease with altitude faster than the light ones.
7322,"Therefore we would expect that because oxygen is heavier than nitrogen, as we go higher and higher in an atmosphere with nitrogen and oxygen the proportion of nitrogen would increase."
7323,"This does not really happen in our own atmosphere, at least at reasonable heights, because there is so much agitation which mixes the gases back together again."
7324,It is not an isothermal atmosphere.
7325,"Nevertheless, there is a tendency for lighter materials, like hydrogen, to dominate at very great heights in the atmosphere, because the lowest masses continue to exist, while the other exponentials have all died out (Fig."
7326,40–2).
7327,Here we note the interesting fact that the numerator in the exponent of Eq.
7328,(40.1) is the potential energy of an atom.
7329,"That may be an accident, i.e., may be true only for this particular case of a uniform gravitational field."
7330,"However, we can show that it is a more general proposition."
7331,Suppose that there were some kind of force other than gravity acting on the molecules in a gas.
7332,"For example, the molecules may be charged electrically, and may be acted on by an electric field or another charge that attracts them."
7333,"Or, because of the mutual attractions of the atoms for each other, or for the wall, or for a solid, or something, there is some force of attraction which varies with position and which acts on all the molecules."
7334,"Now suppose, for simplicity, that the molecules are all the same, and that the force acts on each individual one, so that the total force on a piece of gas would be simply the number of molecules times the force on each one."
7335,Then (40.2) has no solution at all.
7336,"Energy can be generated, or lost by the atoms running around in cyclic paths for which the work done is not zero, and no equilibrium can be maintained at all."
7337,Thermal equilibrium cannot exist if the external forces on the atoms are not conservative.)
7338,"This, then, could tell us the distribution of molecules: Suppose that we had a positive ion in a liquid, attracting negative ions around it, how many of them would be at different distances?"
7339,"If the potential energy is known as a function of distance, then the proportion of them at different distances is given by this law, and so on, through many applications."
7340,In more advanced statistical mechanics one tries to solve the following important problem.
7341,Figure 40–3 shows a form such a function might have.
7342,"Now suppose we have a whole box full of such molecules, and we would like to know how they arrange themselves on the average."
7343,"The total potential energy in this case would be the sum over all the pairs, supposing that the forces are all in pairs (there may be three-body forces in more complicated things, but in electricity, for example, the potential energy is all in pairs)."
7344,"Clearly, where the potential goes most negative, the probability is largest, and where the potential goes toward infinity, the probability is almost zero, which occurs for very small distances."
7345,"That means that for such atoms in a gas, there is no chance that they are on top of each other, since they repel so strongly."
7346,"How much greater, depends on the temperature."
7347,"In other words, in a given volume they are much more likely to be at the distance of minimum energy than far apart."
7348,"As the temperature falls, the atoms fall together, clump in lumps, and reduce to liquids, and solids, and molecules, and as you heat them up they evaporate."
7349,"The requirements for the determination of exactly how things evaporate, exactly how things should happen in a given circumstance, involve the following."
7350,"Surprisingly enough, since it is such a simple function and such an easy idea, given the potential, the labor is enormously complicated; the difficulty is the tremendous number of variables."
7351,"In spite of such difficulties, the subject is quite exciting and interesting."
7352,"It is often called an example of a “many-body problem,” and it really has been a very interesting thing."
7353,"In that single formula must be contained all the details, for example, about the solidification of gas, or the forms of the crystals that the solid can take, and people have been trying to squeeze it out, but the mathematical difficulties are very great, not in writing the law, but in dealing with so enormous a number of variables."
7354,"That then, is the distribution of particles in space."
7355,"That is the end of classical statistical mechanics, practically speaking, because if we know the forces, we can, in principle, find the distribution in space, and the distribution of velocities is something that we can work out once and for all, and is not something that is different for the different cases."
7356,"The great problems are in getting particular information out of our formal solution, and that is the main subject of classical statistical mechanics."
7357,"Now we go on to discuss the distribution of velocities, because sometimes it is interesting or useful to know how many of them are moving at different speeds."
7358,"In order to do that, we may make use of the facts which we discovered with regard to the gas in the atmosphere."
7359,"We take it to be a perfect gas, as we have already assumed in writing the potential energy, disregarding the energy of mutual attraction of the atoms."
7360,The only potential energy that we included in our first example was gravity.
7361,"We would, of course, have something more complicated if there were forces between the atoms."
7362,"Thus we assume that there are no forces between the atoms and, for a moment, disregard collisions also, returning later to the justification of this."
7363,How can there be fewer at greater heights?
7364,"These gas molecules are moving around in every direction, but some of them are moving through the plane, and at any moment a certain number per second of them are passing through the plane from below to above with different velocities."
7365,"We know already that the distribution of velocities is the same, after the argument we made earlier about the temperature being constant all the way through the atmosphere."
7366,The result is a general proposition that gives us the distribution of velocities.
7367,Now we return to the question about the neglect of collisions: Why does it not make any difference?
7368,"But that was not necessary: the argument is evidently based on an analysis of the energies involved, the conservation of energy, and in the collisions that occur there is an exchange of energies among the molecules."
7369,"However, we do not really care whether we follow the same molecule if energy is merely exchanged with another molecule."
7370,"So it turns out that even if the problem is analyzed more carefully (and it is more difficult, naturally, to do a rigorous job), it still makes no difference in the result."
7371,(40.4).
7372,"We would like to state our result in the more conventional form, even though what we already have written is quite general."
7373,"So in order to make a meaningful statement, we have to ask how many are to be found in some range of velocities."
7374,Now we have only to get this distribution by comparing it with the theorem we derived before.
7375,"The faster ones pass more often, so to speak, than the slower ones, and in order to express how many pass, you have to multiply by the velocity."
7376,(We discussed that in the previous chapter when we talked about the number of collisions.)
7377,(40.5).
7378,"So far we have, of course, only the distribution of the velocities “vertically.” We might want to ask, what is the probability that a molecule is moving in another direction?"
7379,"It must be something that is independent of direction, and there is only one function involved, the probability of different magnitudes."
7380,But this one function (40.9) can do both those things!
7381,"Now we shall look at some ways to test the theory, and to see how successful is the classical theory of gases."
7382,We will return to that approach later.
7383,"For a diatomic gas, we may take, as an example, oxygen, hydrogen iodide, hydrogen, etc., and suppose that the diatomic gas can be represented as two atoms held together by some kind of force like the one of Fig."
7384,40–3.
7385,"A parabolic potential implies a harmonic oscillator, and in fact, to an excellent approximation, the oxygen molecule can be represented as two atoms connected by a spring."
7386,"Regarding the rotation, it can turn about either of two axes, so there are two independent motions."
7387,"We assume that the atoms are some kind of points, and cannot spin about the line joining them; this is something to bear in mind, because if we get a disagreement, maybe that is where the trouble is."
7388,"But we have one more thing, which is the potential energy of vibration; how much is that?"
7389,We may compare these numbers with the relevant measured values shown in Table 40–1.
7390,"Krypton and argon, both monatomic, agree also within the accuracy of the experiment."
7391,So here we have a dilemma.
7392,"We have it right for one molecule, we do not have it right for another molecule, and we may need to be pretty ingenious in order to explain both."
7393,"Furthermore, the whole mystery is deep, because the diatomic molecule cannot be made rigid by a limit."
7394,"Even if we made the couplings stiffer indefinitely, although it might not vibrate much, it would nevertheless keep vibrating."
7395,From the measured values shown in Fig.
7396,"So, all in all, we might say that we have some difficulty."
7397,All the classical theoretical things that one can think of will only make it worse.
7398,It is ridiculous.
7399,It is wrong.
7400,The first great paper on the dynamical theory of gases was by Maxwell in 1859.
7401,"On the basis of ideas we have been discussing, he was able accurately to explain a great many known relations, such as Boyle’s law, the diffusion theory, the viscosity of gases, and things we shall talk about in the next chapter."
7402,"Ten years later, in a lecture, he said, “I have now put before you what I consider to be the greatest difficulty yet encountered by the molecular theory.” These words represent the first discovery that the laws of classical physics were wrong."
7403,"This was the first indication that there was something fundamentally impossible, because a rigorously proved theorem did not agree with experiment."
7404,"About 1905, Sir James  Hopwood Jeans and Lord Rayleigh (John William Strutt) were to talk about this  puzzle again."
7405,One often hears it said that physicists at the latter part of the nineteenth century thought they knew all the significant physical laws and that all they had to do was to calculate more decimal places.
7406,"Someone may have said that once, and others copied it."
7407,But a thorough reading of the literature of the time shows they were all worrying about something.
7408,"Jeans said about this puzzle that it is a very mysterious phenomenon, and it seems as though as the temperature falls, certain kinds of motions “freeze out.”"
7409,The same might be argued for the rotation.
7410,How can we understand such a phenomenon?
7411,Of course that these motions “freeze out” cannot be understood by classical mechanics.
7412,It was only understood when quantum mechanics was discovered.
7413,"Without proof, we may state the results for statistical mechanics of the quantum-mechanical theory."
7414,"We recall that according to quantum mechanics, a system which is bound by a potential, for the vibrations, for example, will have a discrete set of energy levels, i.e., states of different energy."
7415,Now the question is: how is statistical mechanics to be modified according to quantum-mechanical theory?
7416,"It turns out, interestingly enough, that although most problems are more difficult in quantum mechanics than in classical mechanics, problems in statistical mechanics are much easier in quantum theory!"
7417,That gives the probability of being in various states.
7418,So it is less likely to be in a higher energy state than in a lower one.
7419,Now it turns out that for a harmonic oscillator the energy levels are evenly spaced.
7420,Now let us see what happens.
7421,"We suppose we are studying the vibrations of a diatomic molecule, which we approximate as a harmonic oscillator."
7422,"All oscillators are in the bottom state, and their motion is effectively “frozen”; there is no contribution of it to the specific heat."
7423,"The reason for the difference is that an iodine atom is very heavy, compared with hydrogen, and although the forces may be comparable in iodine and hydrogen, the iodine molecule is so heavy that the natural frequency of vibration is very low compared with the natural frequency of hydrogen."
7424,"When the probability is appreciable for many states, the behavior of the gas approaches that given by classical physics, because the quantized states become nearly indistinguishable from a continuum of energies, and the system can have almost any energy."
7425,"Thus, as the temperature rises, we should again get the results of classical physics, as indeed seems to be the case in Fig."
7426,40–6.
7427,"Then many levels are excited, and the rotational kinetic energy in the system participates in the classical way."
7428,The one example where this is not quite true at room temperature is for hydrogen.
7429,"This is the first time that we have really deduced, by comparison with experiment, that there was something wrong with classical physics, and we have looked for a resolution of the difficulty in quantum mechanics in much the same way as it was done originally."
7430,"It took 30 or 40 years before the next difficulty was discovered, and that had to do again with statistical mechanics, but this time the mechanics of a photon gas."
7431,"That problem was solved by Planck, in the early years of the 20th century."
7432,"The Brownian movement was discovered in 1827 by Robert Brown, a botanist."
7433,"While he was studying microscopic life, he noticed little particles of plant pollens jiggling around in the liquid he was looking at in the microscope, and he was wise enough to realize that these were not living, but were just little pieces of dirt moving around in the water."
7434,In fact he helped to demonstrate that this had nothing to do with life by getting from the ground an old piece of quartz in which there was some water trapped.
7435,"It must have been trapped for millions and millions of years, but inside he could see the same motion."
7436,What one sees is that very tiny particles are jiggling all the time.
7437,"This was later proved to be one of the effects of molecular motion, and we can understand it qualitatively by thinking of a great push ball on a playing field, seen from a great distance, with a lot of people underneath, all pushing the ball in various directions."
7438,"We cannot see the people because we imagine that we are too far away, but we can see the ball, and we notice that it moves around rather irregularly."
7439,"If it is very heavy, that means that the speeds are relatively slow, but it turns out, actually, that the speed is not really so slow."
7440,How far it does get we will discuss at the end of the present chapter.
7441,This problem was first solved by Einstein at the beginning of the 20th century.
7442,"We shall find that we can derive all kinds of things—marvelous things—from the kinetic theory, and it is most interesting that we can apparently get so much from so little."
7443,"Of course we do not mean that Newton’s laws are “little”—they are enough to do it, really—what we mean is that we did not do very much."
7444,How do we get so much out?
7445,"The answer is that we have been perpetually making a certain important assumption, which is that if a given system is in thermal equilibrium at some temperature, it will also be in thermal equilibrium with anything else at the same temperature."
7446,"For instance, if we wanted to see how a particle would move if it was really colliding with water, we could imagine that there was a gas present, composed of another kind of particle, little fine pellets that (we suppose) do not interact with water, but only hit the particle with “hard” collisions."
7447,Suppose the particle has a prong sticking out of it; all our pellets have to do is hit the prong.
7448,"Water is complicated, but an ideal gas is simple."
7449,"Now, our particle has to be in equilibrium with the gas of pellets."
7450,"Therefore, the mean motion of the particle must be what we get for gaseous collisions, because if it were not moving at the right speed relative to the water but, say, was moving faster, that would mean that the pellets would pick up energy from it and get hotter than the water."
7451,"But we had started them at the same temperature, and we assume that if a thing is once in equilibrium, it stays in equilibrium—parts of it do not get hotter and other parts colder, spontaneously."
7452,"This proposition is true and can be proved from the laws of mechanics, but the proof is very complicated and can be established only by using advanced mechanics."
7453,It is much easier to prove in quantum mechanics than it is in classical mechanics.
7454,"It is a strange line of argument, but perfectly valid."
7455,"In addition to the motion of colloidal particles for which the Brownian movement was first discovered, there are a number of other phenomena, both in the laboratory and in other situations, where one can see Brownian movement."
7456,"If we are trying to build the most delicate possible equipment, say a very small mirror on a thin quartz fiber for a very sensitive ballistic galvanometer (Fig."
7457,"41–1), the mirror does not stay put, but jiggles all the time—all the time—so that when we shine a light on it and look at the position of the spot, we do not have a perfect instrument because the mirror is always jiggling."
7458,Why?
7459,What is the mean-square angle over which the mirror will wobble?
7460,We know the formula for the kinetic energy of rotation—it is given by Eq.
7461,"If we want to have smaller oscillations, we have to cool the mirror."
7462,"An interesting question is, where to cool it."
7463,This depends upon where it is getting its “kicks” from.
7464,"If it is through the fiber, we cool it at the top—if the mirror is surrounded by a gas and is getting hit mostly by collisions in the gas, it is better to cool the gas."
7465,"As a matter of fact, if we know where the damping of the oscillations comes from, it turns out that that is always the source of the fluctuations also, a point which we will come back to."
7466,"The same thing works, amazingly enough, in electrical circuits."
7467,"Suppose that we are building a very sensitive, accurate amplifier for a definite frequency and have a resonant circuit (Fig."
7468,"41–2) in the input so as to make it very sensitive to this certain frequency, like a radio receiver, but a really good one."
7469,"Suppose we wish to go down to the very lowest limit of things, so we take the voltage, say off the inductance, and send it into the rest of the amplifier."
7470,"Of course, in any circuit like this, there is a certain amount of loss."
7471,"It is not a perfect resonant circuit, but it is a very good one and there is a little resistance, say (we put the resistor in so we can see it, but it is supposed to be small)."
7472,Now we would like to find out: How much does the voltage across the inductance fluctuate?
7473,Where do the fluctuations come from this time?
7474,"They come again from the resistor—they come from the fact that the electrons in the resistor are jiggling around because they are in thermal equilibrium with the matter in the resistor, and they make fluctuations in the density of electrons."
7475,They thus make tiny electric fields which drive the resonant circuit.
7476,Electrical engineers represent the answer in another way.
7477,"Physically, the resistor is effectively the source of noise."
7478,"However, we may replace the real circuit having an honest, true physical resistor which is making noise, by an artificial circuit which contains a little generator that is going to represent the noise, and now the resistor is otherwise ideal—no noise comes from it."
7479,All the noise is in the artificial generator.
7480,"And so if we knew the characteristics of the noise generated by a resistor, if we had the formula for that, then we could calculate what the circuit is going to do in response to that noise."
7481,"So, we need a formula for the noise fluctuations."
7482,"Now the noise that is generated by the resistor is at all frequencies, since the resistor by itself is not resonant."
7483,"Of course the resonant circuit only “listens” to the part that is near the right frequency, but the resistor has many different frequencies in it."
7484,But we would like to know in more detail how much power there is at every frequency.
7485,There is very little power in any one frequency; it is a distribution.
7486,Now we go on to consider a still more advanced and interesting proposition that is as follows.
7487,"Suppose we have a charged oscillator like those we were talking about when we were discussing light, let us say an electron oscillating up and down in an atom."
7488,"If it oscillates up and down, it radiates light."
7489,"Now suppose that this oscillator is in a very thin gas of other atoms, and that from time to time the atoms collide with it."
7490,"And that is, of course, the way a warm stove cools, by radiating the light into the sky, because the atoms are jiggling their charge and they continually radiate, and slowly, because of this radiation, the jiggling motion slows down."
7491,"On the other hand, if we enclose the whole thing in a box so that the light does not go away to infinity, then we can eventually get thermal equilibrium."
7492,"We may either put the gas in a box where we can say that there are other radiators in the box walls sending light back or, to take a nicer example, we may suppose the box has mirror walls."
7493,It is easier to think about that case.
7494,Thus we assume that all the radiation that goes out from the oscillator keeps running around in the box.
7495,"That is, after a while there is a great deal of light rushing around in the box, and although the oscillator is radiating some, the light comes back and returns some of the energy that was radiated."
7496,"Let the gas atoms be very few and far between, so that we have an ideal oscillator with no resistance except radiation resistance."
7497,Then we consider that at thermal equilibrium the oscillator is doing two things at the same time.
7498,"Second, this radiation should be exactly the amount that would result because of the fact that the light shining on the oscillator is scattered."
7499,"Since there is nowhere else the energy can go, this effective radiation is really just scattered light from the light that is in there."
7500,"Thus we first calculate the energy that is radiated by the oscillator per second, if the oscillator has a certain energy."
7501,(We borrow from Chapter 32 on radiation resistance a number of equations without going back over their derivation.)
7502,Gamma is easily found from Eq.
7503,(32.12).
7504,Next we ask how much light must be shining on the oscillator.
7505,It must be enough that the energy absorbed from the light (and thereupon scattered) is just exactly this much.
7506,"In other words, the emitted light is accounted for as scattered light from the light that is shining on the oscillator in the cavity."
7507,So we must now calculate how much light is scattered from the oscillator if there is a certain amount—unknown—of radiation incident on it.
7508,Now how much light is absorbed?
7509,"We worked out the amount of radiation absorbed from a given incident light beam, and we calculated it in terms of a cross section."
7510,It is just as though we said that all of the light that falls on a certain cross section is absorbed.
7511,The formula for the cross section that we derived (Eq.
7512,32.19) did not have the damping included.
7513,"It is not hard to go through the derivation again and put in the resistance term, which we neglected."
7514,"(We do not really have to make any approximations, but it is much easier to do the integrals if we simplify the equation a bit.)"
7515,Why three?
7516,"Because when we made our analysis of the cross section in Chapter 32, we assumed that the polarization was such that the light could drive the oscillator."
7517,"If we had used an oscillator which could move only in one direction, and the light, say, was polarized in the wrong way, it would not give any scattering."
7518,"So we must either average the cross section of an oscillator which can go only in one direction, over all directions of incidence and polarization of the light or, more easily, we can imagine an oscillator which will follow the field no matter which way the field is pointing."
7519,Now we have to do the integral.
7520,41–3).
7521,It is called the blackbody radiation.
7522,"Black, because the hole in the furnace that we look at is black when the temperature is zero."
7523,"First, let us notice a remarkable feature of that expression."
7524,"The charge of the oscillator, the mass of the oscillator, all properties specific to the oscillator, cancel out, because once we have reached equilibrium with one oscillator, we must be at equilibrium with any other oscillator of a different mass, or we will be in trouble."
7525,"So this is an important kind of check on the proposition that equilibrium does not depend on what we are in equilibrium with, but only on the temperature."
7526,41–4).
7527,It tells us how much light we have at different frequencies.
7528,"The amount of intensity that there is in our box, per unit frequency range, goes, as we see, as the square of the frequency, which means that if we have a box at any temperature at all, and if we look at the x-rays that are coming out, there will be a lot of them!"
7529,Of course we know this is false.
7530,"When we open the furnace and take a look at it, we do not burn our eyes out from x-rays at all."
7531,It is completely false.
7532,"Furthermore, the total energy in the box, the total of all this intensity summed over all frequencies, would be the area under this infinite curve."
7533,"Therefore, something is fundamentally, powerfully, and absolutely wrong."
7534,"Thus was the classical theory absolutely incapable of correctly describing the distribution of light from a blackbody, just as it was incapable of correctly describing the specific heats of gases."
7535,"Physicists went back and forth over this derivation from many different points of view, and there is no escape."
7536,This is the prediction of classical physics.
7537,"Equation (41.13) is called Rayleigh’s law, and it is the prediction of classical physics, and is obviously absurd."
7538,"The difficulty above was another part of the continual problem of classical physics, which started with the difficulty of the specific heat of gases, and now has been focused on the distribution of light in a blackbody."
7539,"Now, of course, at the time that theoreticians studied this thing, there were also many measurements of the actual curve."
7540,And it turned out that the correct curve looked like the dashed curves in Fig.
7541,41–4.
7542,"That is, the x-rays were not there."
7543,"Thus the low-frequency end of the curve is right, but the high-frequency end is wrong."
7544,Why?
7545,"When Sir James Jeans was worrying about the specific heats of gases, he noted that motions which have high frequency are “frozen out” as the temperature goes too low."
7546,Now recall how our derivation of (41.13) worked: It all depends on the energy of an oscillator at thermal equilibrium.
7547,And so the reason that the curve falls off is the same reason that the specific heats of gases fail.
7548,"It is easier to study the blackbody curve than it is the specific heats of gases, which are so complicated, therefore our attention is focused on determining the true blackbody curve, because this curve is a curve which correctly tells us, at every frequency, what the average energy of harmonic oscillators actually is as a function of temperature."
7549,Planck studied this curve.
7550,"He first determined the answer empirically, by fitting the observed curve with a nice function that fitted very well."
7551,Thus he had an empirical formula for the average energy of a harmonic oscillator as a function of frequency.
7552,The idea that they can have any energy at all is false.
7553,"Of course, that was the beginning of the end of classical mechanics."
7554,The very first correctly determined quantum-mechanical formula will now be derived.
7555,41–5).
7556,"Planck made a somewhat more complicated argument than the one that is being given here, because that was the very beginning of quantum mechanics and he had to prove some things."
7557,"If we go along with that, we will obtain the right result."
7558,"Some of these vibrators will be in the bottom quantum state, some will be in the next one, and so forth."
7559,What we would like to know is the average energy of all these oscillators.
7560,"To find out, let us calculate the total energy of all the oscillators and divide by the number of oscillators."
7561,"That will be the average energy per oscillator in thermal equilibrium, and will also be the energy that is in equilibrium with the blackbody radiation and that should go in Eq."
7562,The total energy of all the oscillators must first be worked out.
7563,"If an oscillator is in the ground state, there is no energy."
7564,"And now, how many oscillators are there?"
7565,"Maxwell knew that there was something wrong, and the problem was, what was right?"
7566,See if you can prove that it does—learn how to do the mathematics.
7567,But the quantum theory of light interacting with a harmonic oscillator gives exactly the same result as that given by the classical theory.
7568,"That, in fact, is why we were justified in spending so much time on our analysis of the index of refraction and the scattering of light, using a model of atoms like little oscillators—the quantum formulas are substantially the same."
7569,Now let us return to the Johnson noise in a resistor.
7570,We have already remarked that the theory of this noise power is really the same theory as that of the classical blackbody distribution.
7571,"In fact, rather amusingly, we have already said that if the resistance in a circuit were not a real resistance, but were an antenna (an antenna acts like a resistance because it radiates energy), a radiation resistance, it would be easy for us to calculate what the power would be."
7572,"It would be just the power that runs into the antenna from the light that is all around, and we would get the same distribution, changed by only one or two factors."
7573,"The spectrum is determined by the fact that this same generator, connected to a resonant circuit of any frequency, as in Fig."
7574,"41–2(b), generates in the inductance a voltage of the magnitude given in Eq."
7575,(41.2).
7576,"One is thus led to the same integral as in (41.10), and the same method works to give Eq."
7577,(41.3).
7578,"All the things we have been talking about—the so-called Johnson noise and Planck’s distribution, and the correct theory of the Brownian movement which we are about to describe—are developments of the first decade or so of the 20th century."
7579,"Now with those points and that history in mind, we return to the Brownian movement."
7580,"Let us consider how the position of a jiggling particle should change with time, for very long times compared with the time between “kicks.” Consider a little Brownian movement particle which is jiggling about because it is bombarded on all sides by irregularly jiggling water molecules."
7581,"Query: After a given length of time, how far away is it likely to be from where it began?"
7582,This problem was solved by Einstein and Smoluchowski.
7583,"If we imagine that we divide the time into little intervals, let us say a hundredth of a second or so, then after the first hundredth of a second it moves here, and in the next hundredth it moves some more, in the next hundredth of a second it moves somewhere else, and so on."
7584,"In terms of the rate of bombardment, a hundredth of a second is a very long time."
7585,"Therefore, after a hundredth of a second it is not going to remember what happened before."
7586,"In other words, the collisions are all random, so that one “step” is not related to the previous “step.” It is like the famous drunken sailor problem: the sailor comes out of the bar and takes a sequence of steps, but each step is chosen at an arbitrary angle, at random (Fig."
7587,41–6).
7588,"The question is: After a long time, where is the sailor?"
7589,Of course we do not know!
7590,It is impossible to say.
7591,What do we mean—he is just somewhere more or less random.
7592,"Well then, on the average, where is he?"
7593,"On the average, how far away from the bar has he gone?"
7594,"We have already answered this question, because once we were discussing the superposition of light from a whole lot of different sources at different phases, and that meant adding a lot of arrows at different angles (Chapter 32)."
7595,"There we discovered that the mean square of the distance from one end to the other of the chain of random steps, which was the intensity of the light, is the sum of the intensities of the separate pieces."
7596,If the mean distance were proportional to the time it would mean that the drifting is at a nice uniform velocity.
7597,"The sailor is making some relatively sensible headway, but only such that his mean square distance is proportional to time."
7598,That is the characteristic of a random walk.
7599,"(41.17), and to do so we must add a feature."
7600,"We are going to suppose that if we were to put a force on this particle (having nothing to do with the Brownian movement—we are taking a side issue for the moment), then it would react in the following way against the force."
7601,"First, there would be inertia."
7602,"And next, we want also to assume that if we kept a steady pull on the object, there would be a drag on it from the fluid, proportional to its velocity."
7603,"Besides the inertia of the fluid, there is a resistance to flow due to the viscosity and the complexity of the fluid."
7604,"It is absolutely essential that there be some irreversible losses, something like resistance, in order that there be fluctuations."
7605,The source of the fluctuations is very closely related to these losses.
7606,"What the mechanism of this drag is, we will discuss soon—we shall talk about forces that are proportional to the velocity and where they come from."
7607,But let us suppose for now that there is such a resistance.
7608,"For example, we can watch the drop fall under gravity."
7609,Or we could put the drop in a centrifuge and see how fast it sediments.
7610,"Or if it is charged, we can put an electric field on it."
7611,"Now let us use the same formula in the case where the force is not external, but is equal to the irregular forces of the Brownian movement."
7612,We shall then try to determine the mean square distance that the object goes.
7613,"We shall show that this is a constant, and that therefore the mean square radius will increase proportionally to the time, and at what rate."
7614,Now if we multiply Eq.
7615,It is just as likely to be one way as the other.
7616,The bombardment forces are not driving it in a definite direction.
7617,So let us see how much the first term should be.
7618,"So this quantity, on the average, is zero."
7619,"A mole was originally defined as so and so many grams of oxygen-16 (now carbon is used), so the number of atoms in a mole was not known, originally."
7620,"It is, of course, a very interesting and important problem."
7621,How big are atoms?
7622,How many are there?
7623,So one of the earliest determinations of the number of atoms was by the determination of how far a dirty little particle would move if we watched it patiently under a microscope for a certain length of time.
7624,In this chapter we shall discuss some further applications of kinetic theory.
7625,"The phenomena which we want to study are relatively complicated: a liquid evaporating, or electrons in a metal coming out of the surface, or a chemical reaction in which there are a large number of atoms involved."
7626,"In such cases it is no longer possible to make from the kinetic theory any simple and correct statements, because the situation is too complicated."
7627,"Therefore, this chapter, except where otherwise emphasized, is quite inexact."
7628,"The idea to be emphasized is only that we can understand, from the kinetic theory, more or less how things ought to behave."
7629,"By using thermodynamic arguments, or some empirical measurements of certain critical quantities, we can get a more accurate representation of the phenomena."
7630,"However, it is very useful to know even only more or less why something behaves as it does, so that when the situation is a new one, or one that we have not yet started to analyze, we can say, more or less, what ought to happen."
7631,"So this discussion is highly inaccurate but essentially right—right in idea, but a little bit simplified, let us say, in the specific details."
7632,The first example that we shall consider is the evaporation of a liquid.
7633,"Suppose we have a box with a large volume, partially filled with liquid in equilibrium and with the vapor at a certain temperature."
7634,"We shall suppose that the molecules of the vapor are relatively far apart, and that inside the liquid, the molecules are packed close together."
7635,"The problem is to find out how many molecules there are in the vapor phase, compared with the number there are in the liquid."
7636,"How dense is the vapor at a given temperature, and how does it depend on the temperature?"
7637,"That number, of course, varies with the temperature."
7638,"If we add heat, we get more evaporation."
7639,"Furthermore, we suppose that there is a force of attraction between the molecules to hold them together in the liquid."
7640,Otherwise we cannot understand why it condenses.
7641,Thus suppose that there is such a force and that there is an energy of binding of the molecules in the liquid which is lost when they go into the vapor.
7642,"The factors in front are not really interesting to us, because in most cases the vapor density is very much lower than the liquid density."
7643,Because ours was an approximate analysis.
7644,"There are other little features like that, and so the actual situation is more complicated."
7645,There are slowly varying temperature-dependent factors all over the place.
7646,"Now let us consider another way of obtaining a somewhat similar result for the evaporation, but looking at it in more detail."
7647,"To arrive at (42.1), we simply applied a rule which is valid at equilibrium, but in order to understand things better, there is no harm in trying to look at the details of what is going on."
7648,"We may also describe what is going on in the following way: the molecules that are in the vapor continually bombard the surface of the liquid; when they hit it, they may bounce off or they may get stuck."
7649,Let us say they always get stuck—we can analyze it over again later on the assumption that they do not always get stuck.
7650,Then at a given moment there will be a certain number of atoms which are condensing onto the surface of the liquid.
7651,"Of course we should integrate over the angles and get some kind of an average, but it is roughly proportional to the root-mean-square velocity, within some factor."
7652,"At the same time, however, the atoms in the liquid are jiggling about, and from time to time one of them gets kicked out."
7653,Now we have to estimate how fast they get kicked out.
7654,The idea will be that at equilibrium the number that are kicked out per second and the number that arrive per second are equal.
7655,How many get kicked out?
7656,"In order to get kicked out, a particular molecule has to have acquired by accident an excess energy over its neighbors—a considerable excess energy, because it is attracted very strongly by the other molecules in the liquid."
7657,"Ordinarily it does not leave because it is so strongly attracted, but in the collisions sometimes one of them gets an extra energy by accident."
7658,Now suppose that some molecules have borrowed this energy.
7659,We now have to estimate how many leave the surface per second.
7660,"Of course, just because a molecule has the necessary energy does not mean that it will actually evaporate, since it may be buried too deeply inside the liquid or, even if it is near the surface, it may be travelling in the wrong direction."
7661,"And now, how long does it take a molecule to escape?"
7662,"But one may object, “No!"
7663,No!
7664,"These are the especially fast-moving ones; these are the ones that have picked up excess energy.” Not really, because the moment they start to pull away from the liquid, they have to lose that excess energy against the potential energy."
7665,"It is the same as it was in our discussion of the distribution of molecular velocities in the atmosphere—at the bottom, the molecules had a certain distribution of energy."
7666,"The ones that arrive at the top have the same distribution of energy, because the slow ones did not arrive at all, and the fast ones were slowed down."
7667,The molecules that are evaporating have the same distribution of energy as the ones inside—a rather remarkable fact.
7668,"Anyway, it is useless to try to argue so closely about our formula because of other inaccuracies, such as the probability of bouncing back rather than entering the liquid, and so on."
7669,This deeper understanding permits us to analyze some things.
7670,"Suppose that we have already experimentally measured the equilibrium vapor density, so that we know, at the given temperature, how many molecules per unit volume are in equilibrium with the liquid."
7671,Now we would like to know how fast it will evaporate.
7672,"Even though we have used only a rough analysis so far as the evaporation part of it is concerned, the number of vapor molecules arriving was not done so badly, aside from the unknown factor of reflection coefficient."
7673,"So therefore we may use the fact that the number that are leaving, at equilibrium, is the same as the number that arrive."
7674,"True, the vapor is being swept away and so the molecules are only coming out, but if the vapor were left alone, it would attain the equilibrium density at which the number that come back would equal the number that are evaporating."
7675,We may give another example of a very practical situation that is similar to the evaporation of a liquid—so similar that it is not worth making a separate analysis.
7676,It is essentially the same problem.
7677,"In a radio tube there is a source of electrons, namely a heated tungsten filament, and a positively charged plate to attract the electrons."
7678,Any electron that escapes from the surface of the tungsten is immediately swept away to the plate.
7679,"That is our ideal “pump,” which is “pumping” the electrons away all the time."
7680,"Now the question is: How many electrons per second can we get out of a piece of tungsten, and how does that number vary with temperature?"
7681,"The answer to that problem is the same as (42.5), because it turns out that in a piece of metal, electrons are attracted to the ions, or to atoms, of the metal."
7682,"They are attracted, if we may say it crudely, to the metal."
7683,"In order to get an electron out of a piece of metal, it takes a certain amount of energy or work to pull it out."
7684,This work varies with the different kinds of metal.
7685,"In fact, it varies even with the character of the surface of a given kind of metal, but the total work may be a few electron volts, which, incidentally, is typical of the energy involved in chemical reactions."
7686,"We can remember the latter fact by remembering that the voltage in a chemical cell like a flashlight battery, which is produced by chemical reactions, is about one volt."
7687,How can we find out how many electrons come out per second?
7688,It would be quite difficult to analyze the effects on the electrons going out; it is easier to analyze the situation the other way.
7689,"So, we could start out by imagining that we did not draw the electrons away, and that the electrons were like a gas, and could come back to the metal."
7690,This would tell us how many electrons would have to be in the surrounding space and striking the metal in order to balance the ones that are coming out.
7691,"As a matter of fact, the factor in front is quite wrong—it turns out that the behavior of electrons in a metal is not correctly described by the classical theory, but by quantum mechanics, but this only changes the factor in front a little."
7692,"Actually, no one has ever been able to get the thing straightened out very well, even though many people have used the high-class quantum-mechanical theory for their calculations."
7693,Now we go on to another example of the same idea; always the same idea.
7694,This has to do with ionization.
7695,"Suppose that in a gas we have a whole lot of atoms which are in the neutral state, say, but the gas is hot and the atoms can become ionized."
7696,We would like to know how many ions there are in a given circumstance if we have a certain density of atoms per unit volume at a certain temperature.
7697,"(If an electron has come off an atom, it is called an ion, and if the atom is neutral, we simply call it an atom.)"
7698,The problem is: What is the relationship of these three numbers?
7699,"In the first place, we have two conditions or constraints on the numbers."
7700,"If we keep the number of nuclei per unit volume fixed, and change, say, the temperature, then as the ionization proceeded some atoms would turn to ions, but the total number of atoms plus ions would be unchanged."
7701,These are subsidiary equations that simply express the conservation of charge and the conservation of atoms.
7702,"These equations are true, and we ultimately will use them when we consider a real problem."
7703,But we want to obtain another relationship between the quantities.
7704,We can do this as follows.
7705,That is the basic equation again.
7706,How can we write it?
7707,Now what about the number of electrons per unit volume that are bound to atoms?
7708,"In other words, all the volumes of all the possible sites are not really available for the one electron which is trying to make up its mind whether or not to be in the vapor or in the condensed position, because in this problem there is an extra feature that when one electron is where another electron is, it is not allowed to go—it is repelled."
7709,"For that reason, it comes out that we should count only that part of the volume which is available for an electron to sit on or not."
7710,"That is, those which are already occupied do not count in the total available volume, but the only volume which is allowed is that of the ions, where there are vacant places for the electron to go."
7711,"Now let us see if we can understand qualitatively why a formula like this is right, by arguing about the kinetic things that are happening."
7712,"First, every once in a while an electron comes to an ion and they combine to make an atom."
7713,"And also, every once in a while, an atom gets into a collision and breaks up into an ion and an electron."
7714,Now those two rates must be equal.
7715,How fast do electrons and ions find each other?
7716,The rate is certainly increased if the number of electrons per unit volume is increased.
7717,It is also increased if the number of ions per unit volume is increased.
7718,"That is, the total rate at which recombination is occurring is certainly proportional to the number of electrons times the number of ions."
7719,Now the total rate at which ionization is occurring due to collisions must be dependent linearly on how many atoms there are to ionize.
7720,"That ionization, just from “expansion” as the density goes down, is the reason why we believe that at very low densities, such as in the cold space between the stars, there may be ions present, even though we might not understand it from the point of view of the available energy."
7721,"Why can there be ions present when there is so much space around, while if we increase the density, the ions tend to disappear?"
7722,Answer: Consider an atom.
7723,"Every once in a while, light, or another atom, or an ion, or whatever it is that maintains thermal equilibrium, strikes it."
7724,"Very rarely, because it takes such a terrific amount of excess energy, an electron comes off and an ion is left."
7725,"Now that electron, if the space is enormous, wanders and wanders and does not come near anything for years, perhaps."
7726,"But once in a very great while, it does come back to an ion and they combine to make an atom."
7727,So the rate at which electrons are coming out from the atoms is very slow.
7728,"But if the volume is enormous, an electron which has escaped takes so long to find another ion to recombine with that its probability of recombination is very, very small; thus, in spite of the large excess energy needed, there may be a reasonable number of electrons."
7729,The same situation that we have just called “ionization” is also found in a chemical reaction.
7730,"Suppose that we tried to understand this formula as a result of collisions, much in the way that we understood the evaporation formula, by arguing about how many electrons came off and how many of them came back per unit time."
7731,This energy is called the activation energy—the energy needed to “activate” the reaction.
7732,It is like climbing a hill to get into a deep valley; they have to climb the hill coming in and they have to climb out of the valley and then over the hill coming back (Fig.
7733,42–1).
7734,"The main feature of interest to us is that when these two rates are equal, the ratio of them is equal to unity."
7735,"In other words, we might find a “tunnel” through the hill, or perhaps a lower hill."
7736,This is why the rates of chemical reactions are very sensitive to outside conditions.
7737,"We can change the rate by putting in a surface of a different kind, we can put it in a “different barrel” and it will go at a different rate, if it depends on the nature of the surface."
7738,"The law of equilibrium, (42.9), which we first wrote down is absolutely guaranteed to be true, no matter what the mechanism of the reaction may be!"
7739,We now turn to an interesting analogous situation having to do with the blackbody radiation law.
7740,"In the last chapter we worked out the distribution law for the radiation in a cavity the way Planck did, considering the radiation from an oscillator."
7741,"The oscillator had to have a certain mean energy, and since it was oscillating, it would radiate and would keep pumping radiation into the cavity until it piled up enough radiation to balance the absorption and emission."
7742,We did not say that light had to be a photon or anything like that.
7743,"Planck’s original idea was that the matter was quantized but not the light: material oscillators cannot take up just any energy, but have to take it in lumps."
7744,"Furthermore, the trouble with the derivation is that it was partially classical."
7745,"We calculated the rate of radiation from an oscillator according to classical physics; then we turned around and said, “No, this oscillator has a lot of energy levels.” So gradually, in order to find the right result, the completely quantum-mechanical result, there was a slow development which culminated in the quantum mechanics of 1927."
7746,"Furthermore, Bohr had pointed out that any system of atoms has energy levels, but they are not necessarily equally spaced like Planck’s oscillator."
7747,And so it became necessary to rederive or at least rediscuss the radiation law from a more completely quantum-mechanical viewpoint.
7748,"Einstein assumed that Planck’s final formula was right, and he used that formula to obtain some new information, previously unknown, about the interaction of radiation with matter."
7749,42–2).
7750,Einstein proposed that this must have two parts to it.
7751,"First, even if there were no light present, there would be some chance that an atom in an excited state would fall to a lower state, emitting a photon; this we call spontaneous emission."
7752,"It is analogous to the idea that an oscillator with a certain amount of energy, even in classical physics, does not keep that energy, but loses it by radiation."
7753,"Later, if we deduce that this coefficient is zero, then we will have found that Einstein was wrong."
7754,Of course we will find he was right.
7755,"Thus Einstein assumed that there are three kinds of processes: an absorption proportional to the intensity of light, an emission proportional to the intensity of light, called induced emission or sometimes stimulated emission, and a spontaneous emission independent of light."
7756,"That is one way, at least, in which the number will be sure to stay constant in each level.1 So we take these two rates to be equal at equilibrium."
7757,"So Einstein discovered some things that he did not know how to calculate, namely that the induced emission probability and the absorption probability must be equal."
7758,This is interesting.
7759,This is as far as Einstein or anyone else could go using such arguments.
7760,"To actually compute the absolute spontaneous emission rate or the other rates for any specific atomic transition, of course, requires a knowledge of the machinery of the atom, called quantum electrodynamics, which was not discovered until eleven years later."
7761,This work of Einstein was done in 1916.
7762,"The possibility of induced emission has, today, found interesting applications."
7763,"If there is light present, it will tend to induce the downward transition."
7764,"We can even arrange it so that the number in the upper state is very large, while the number in the lower state is practically zero."
7765,"On the other hand, when that light is present, it will induce the emission from this upper state!"
7766,"So, if we had a lot of atoms in the upper state, there would be a sort of chain reaction, in which, the moment the atoms began to emit, more would be caused to emit, and the whole lot of them would dump down together."
7767,"This is what is called a laser, or, in the case of the far infrared, a maser."
7768,There may be higher levels to which the atoms can get if we shine in a strong beam of light of high frequency.
7769,And then they are all dumped down together by induced emissions.
7770,"One more technical point—if we put this system in an ordinary box, it would radiate in so many different directions spontaneously, compared with the induced effect, that we would still be in trouble."
7771,"But we can enhance the induced effect, increase its efficiency, by putting nearly perfect mirrors on each side of the box, so that the light which is emitted gets another chance, and another chance, and another chance, to induce more emission."
7772,"Although the mirrors are almost one hundred percent reflecting, there is a slight amount of transmission of the mirror, and a little light gets out."
7773,"In the end, of course, from the conservation of energy, all the light goes out in a nice uniform straight direction which makes the strong light beams that are possible today with lasers."
7774,We have considered so far only the molecular motions in a gas which is in thermal equilibrium.
7775,"We want now to discuss what happens when things are near, but not exactly in, equilibrium."
7776,"In a situation far from equilibrium, things are extremely complicated, but in a situation very close to equilibrium we can easily work out what happens."
7777,"To see what happens, we must, however, return to the kinetic theory."
7778,"Statistical mechanics and thermodynamics deal with the equilibrium situation, but away from equilibrium we can only analyze what occurs atom by atom, so to speak."
7779,"As a simple example of a nonequilibrium circumstance, we shall consider the diffusion of ions in a gas."
7780,Suppose that in a gas there is a relatively small concentration of ions—electrically charged molecules.
7781,"If we put an electric field on the gas, then each ion will have a force on it which is different from the forces on the neutral molecules of the gas."
7782,"If there were no other molecules present, an ion would have a constant acceleration until it reached the wall of the container."
7783,"But because of the presence of the other molecules, it cannot do that; its velocity increases only until it collides with a molecule and loses its momentum."
7784,"It starts again to pick up more speed, but then it loses its momentum again."
7785,"The net effect is that an ion works its way along an erratic path, but with a net motion in the direction of the electric force."
7786,"We shall see that the ion has an average “drift” with a mean speed which is proportional to the electric field—the stronger the field, the faster it goes."
7787,"While the field is on, and while the ion is moving along, it is, of course, not in thermal equilibrium, it is trying to get to equilibrium, which is to be sitting at the end of the container."
7788,By means of the kinetic theory we can compute the drift velocity.
7789,"It turns out that with our present mathematical abilities we cannot really compute precisely what will happen, but we can obtain approximate results which exhibit all the essential features."
7790,"We can find out how things will vary with pressure, with temperature, and so on, but it will not be possible to get precisely the correct numerical factors in front of all the terms."
7791,"We shall, therefore, in our derivations, not worry about the precise value of numerical factors."
7792,They can be obtained only by a very much more sophisticated mathematical treatment.
7793,"Before we consider what happens in nonequilibrium situations, we shall need to look a little closer at what goes on in a gas in thermal equilibrium."
7794,"We shall need to know, for example, what the average time between successive collisions of a molecule is."
7795,"Any molecule experiences a sequence of collisions with other molecules—in a random way, of course."
7796,"If we double the length of time, there will be twice as many hits."
7797,But let us try to make a more convincing argument.
7798,"If there is equilibrium, nothing is changing on the average with time."
7799,"A particular particle does not have a collision, wait one minute, and then have another collision."
7800,The times between successive collisions are quite variable.
7801,"We will not need it for our later work here, but we may make a small diversion to answer the question: “What are the times between collisions?” We know that for the case above, the average time is one minute, but we might like to know, for example, what is the chance that we get no collision for two minutes?"
7802,"Making this substitution, Eq."
7803,The chance is less than one-half that it will have a greater than average time between collisions.
7804,The result we have obtained in Eq.
7805,We can demonstrate this somewhat surprising fact in the following way.
7806,"Another way of describing the molecular collisions is to talk not about the time between collisions, but about how far the particle moves between collisions."
7807,In this chapter we shall be a little careless about what kind of average we mean in any particular case.
7808,"The various possible averages—the mean, the root-mean-square, etc.—are all nearly equal and differ by factors which are near to one."
7809,"Since a detailed analysis is required to obtain the correct numerical factors anyway, we need not worry about which average is required at any particular point."
7810,"The effective “size” of a target in a collision we usually describe by a “collision cross section,” the same idea that is used in nuclear physics, or in light-scattering problems."
7811,43–1).
7812,By “collision cross section” we mean the area within which the center of our particle must be located if it is to collide with a particular molecule.
7813,"The chance that our particle will have a collision is the ratio of the area covered by scattering molecules to the total area, which we have taken to be one."
7814,"The whole area is not covered, of course, because some molecules are partly hidden behind others."
7815,But that is a different subject!
7816,So we return to the problem of nonequilibrium states.
7817,"We want to describe what happens to a molecule, or several molecules, which are different in some way from the large majority of the molecules in a gas."
7818,A molecule could be special for any number of reasons: It might be heavier than the background molecules.
7819,It might be a different chemical.
7820,"It might have an electric charge—i.e., be an ion in a background of uncharged molecules."
7821,"To list a few: the diffusion of gases, electric currents in batteries, sedimentation, centrifugal separation, etc."
7822,"What happens to it, in detail, is that it darts around hither and yon as it collides over and over again with other molecules."
7823,"We say that there is a drift, superposed on its random motion."
7824,We shall discuss later an improved assumption.
7825,"The starting velocity will take it equally in all directions and will not contribute to any net motion, so we shall not worry further about its initial velocity after a collision."
7826,What is the average value of this part of the velocity?
7827,(43.13).
7828,You will notice that the drift velocity is proportional to the force.
7829,"There is, unfortunately, no generally used name for the constant of proportionality."
7830,Different names have been used for each different kind of force.
7831,We have from Eq.
7832,To get the correct numerical coefficient in Eq.
7833,"(43.13), which is correct as given, takes some care."
7834,"Without intending to confuse, we should still point out that the arguments have a subtlety which can be appreciated only by a careful and detailed study."
7835,"To illustrate that there are difficulties, in spite of appearances, we shall make over again the argument which led to Eq."
7836,(43.13) in a reasonable but erroneous way (and the way one will find in many textbooks!
7837,).
7838,"After a collision the particle starts out with a random velocity, but it picks up an additional velocity between collisions, which is equal to the acceleration times the time."
7839,At the beginning of the collision it had zero velocity.
7840,(Wrong!)
7841,This result is wrong and the result in Eq.
7842,"(43.13) is right, although the arguments may sound equally satisfactory."
7843,The fact is that some times are shorter and others are longer than the mean.
7844,The error was made in trying to relate by a simple argument the average final velocity to the average velocity itself.
7845,"This relationship is not simple, so it is best to concentrate on what is wanted: the average velocity itself."
7846,The first argument we gave determines the average velocity directly—and correctly!
7847,But we can perhaps see now why we shall not in general try to get all of the correct numerical coefficients in our elementary derivations!
7848,We return now to our simplifying assumption that each collision knocks out all memory of the past motion—that a fresh start is made after each collision.
7849,It would take several collisions before its motion was “randomized” again.
7850,We now apply our results to a special case.
7851,Suppose we have a gas in a vessel in which there are also some ions—atoms or molecules with a net electric charge.
7852,We show the situation schematically in Fig.
7853,43–2.
7854,"If two opposite walls of the container are metallic plates, we can connect them to the terminals of a battery and thereby produce an electric field in the gas."
7855,"The electric field will result in a force on the ions, so they will begin to drift toward one or the other of the plates."
7856,"An electric current will be induced, and the gas with its ions will behave like a resistor."
7857,By computing the ion flow from the drift velocity we can compute the resistance.
7858,43–2).
7859,(The electric potential is the work done in carrying a unit charge from one plate to the other.
7860,The electric current to one of the plates is given by the total charge of the ions which arrive at the plate in a unit of time.
7861,"We turn now to a different kind of problem, and a different kind of analysis: the theory of diffusion."
7862,"Suppose that we have a container of gas in thermal equilibrium, and that we introduce a small amount of a different kind of gas at some place in the container."
7863,We shall call the original gas the “background” gas and the new one the “special” gas.
7864,"The special gas will start to spread out through the whole container, but it will spread slowly because of the presence of the background gas."
7865,This slow spreading-out process is called diffusion.
7866,The diffusion is controlled mainly by the molecules of the special gas getting knocked about by the molecules of the background gas.
7867,"After a large number of collisions, the special molecules end up spread out more or less evenly throughout the whole volume."
7868,We must be careful not to confuse diffusion of a gas with the gross transport that may occur due to convection currents.
7869,"Most commonly, the mixing of two gases occurs by a combination of convection and diffusion."
7870,We are interested now only in the case that there are no “wind” currents.
7871,"The gas is spreading only by molecular motions, by diffusion."
7872,We wish to compute how fast diffusion takes place.
7873,We now compute the net flow of molecules of the “special” gas due to the molecular motions.
7874,"There will be a net flow only when there is some nonuniform distribution of the molecules, otherwise all of the molecular motions would average to give no net flow."
7875,We shall simplify our algebra by giving our surface one unit of area.
7876,"When we say “the density on the left,” how far to the left do we mean?"
7877,"We should choose the density at the place from which the molecules started their “flight,” because the number which start such trips is determined by the number present at that place."
7878,It is clear that we have made several rough approximations.
7879,All of these refinements can be made; the result of a more careful analysis shows that the right-hand side of Eq.
7880,"So far in this chapter we have considered two distinct processes: mobility, the drift of molecules due to “outside” forces; and diffusion, the spreading determined only by the internal forces, the random collisions."
7881,"If, in Eq."
7882,"We can show, in fact, that (43.31) must always be correct—even in complicated situations (for example, the case of a suspension in a liquid) where the details of our simple calculations would not apply at all."
7883,"To show that (43.31) must be correct in general, we shall derive it in a different way, using only our basic principles of statistical mechanics."
7884,"Imagine a situation in which there is a gradient of “special” molecules, and we have a diffusion current proportional to the density gradient, according to Eq."
7885,(43.26).
7886,But notice!
7887,"We are describing an equilibrium condition, so our equilibrium laws of statistical mechanics apply."
7888,"Comparing (43.40) with (43.36), we get exactly Eq."
7889,(43.31).
7890,We have shown that Eq.
7891,"(43.31), which gives the diffusion current in terms of the mobility, has the correct coefficient and is very generally true."
7892,Mobility and diffusion are intimately connected.
7893,This relation was first deduced by Einstein.
7894,The methods of the kinetic theory that we have been using above can be used also to compute the thermal conductivity of a gas.
7895,"If the gas at the top of a container is hotter than the gas at the bottom, heat will flow from the top to the bottom."
7896,(We think of the top being hotter because otherwise convection currents would be set up and the problem would no longer be one of heat conduction.)
7897,The transfer of heat from the hotter gas to the colder gas is by the diffusion of the “hot” molecules—those with more energy—downward and the diffusion of the “cold” molecules upward.
7898,"To compute the flow of thermal energy we can ask about the energy carried downward across an element of area by the downward-moving molecules, and about the energy carried upward across the surface by the upward-moving molecules."
7899,The difference will give us the net downward flow of energy.
7900,We have a rather surprising result.
7901,We know that the average velocity of gas molecules depends on the temperature but not on the density.
7902,The change in the number of “carriers” of energy with a change in density is just compensated by the larger distance the “carriers” can go between collisions.
7903,One may ask: “Is the heat flow independent of the gas density in the limit as the density goes to zero?
7904,When there is no gas at all?” Certainly not!
7905,"The formula (43.43) was derived, as were all the others in this chapter, under the assumption that the mean free path between collisions is much smaller than any of the dimensions of the container."
7906,"Whenever the gas density is so low that a molecule has a fair chance of crossing from one wall of its container to the other without having a collision, none of the calculations of this chapter apply."
7907,We must in such cases go back to kinetic theory and calculate again the details of what will occur.
7908,"So far we have been discussing the properties of matter from the atomic point of view, trying to understand roughly what will happen if we suppose that things are made of atoms obeying certain laws."
7909,"However, there are a number of relationships among the properties of substances which can be worked out without consideration of the detailed structure of the materials."
7910,"The determination of the relationships among the various properties of materials, without knowing their internal structure, is the subject of thermodynamics."
7911,"Historically, thermodynamics was developed before an understanding of the internal structure of matter was achieved."
7912,"To give an example: we know from the kinetic theory that the pressure of a gas is caused by molecular bombardment, and we know that if we heat a gas, so that the bombardment increases, the pressure must increase."
7913,"Conversely, if the piston in a container of the gas is moved inward against the force of bombardment, the energy of the molecules bombarding the piston will increase, and consequently the temperature will increase."
7914,"So, on the one hand, if we increase the temperature at a given volume, we increase the pressure."
7915,"On the other hand, if we compress the gas, we will find that the temperature will rise."
7916,"From the kinetic theory, one can derive a quantitative relationship between these two effects, but instinctively one might guess that they are related in some necessary fashion which is independent of the details of the collisions."
7917,Let us consider another example.
7918,"Many people are familiar with this interesting property of rubber: If we take a rubber band and pull it, it gets warm."
7919,"If one puts it between his lips, for example, and pulls it out, he can feel a distinct warming, and this warming is reversible in the sense that if he relaxes the rubber band quickly while it is between his lips, it is distinctly cooled."
7920,"That means that when we stretch a rubber band it heats, and when we release the tension of the band it cools."
7921,"Now our instincts might suggest that if we heated a band, it might pull: that the fact that pulling a band heats it might imply that heating a band should cause it to contract."
7922,"And, in fact, if we apply a gas flame to a rubber band holding a weight, we will see that the band contracts abruptly (Fig."
7923,44–1).
7924,"So it is true that when we heat a rubber band it pulls, and this fact is definitely related to the fact that when we release the tension of it, it cools."
7925,The internal machinery of rubber that causes these effects is quite complicated.
7926,"We will describe it from a molecular point of view to some extent, although our main purpose in this chapter is to understand the relationship of these effects independently of the molecular model."
7927,"Nevertheless, we can show from the molecular model that the effects are closely related."
7928,"One way to understand the behavior of rubber is to recognize that this substance consists of an enormous tangle of long chains of molecules, a kind of “molecular spaghetti,” with one extra complication: between the chains there are cross-links—like spaghetti that is sometimes welded together where it crosses another piece of spaghetti—a grand tangle."
7929,"When we pull out such a tangle, some of the chains tend to line up along the direction of the pull."
7930,"At the same time, the chains are in thermal motion, so they hit each other continually."
7931,"It follows that such a chain, if stretched, would not by itself remain stretched, because it would be hit from the sides by the other chains and other molecules, and would tend to kink up again."
7932,"So the real reason why a rubber band tends to contract is this: when one pulls it out, the chains are lengthwise, and the thermal agitations of the molecules on the sides of the chains tend to kink the chains up, and make them shorten."
7933,"One can then appreciate that if the chains are held stretched and the temperature is increased, so that the vigor of the bombardment on the sides of the chains is also increased, the chains tend to pull in, and they are able to pull a stronger weight when heated."
7934,"If, after being stretched for a time, a rubber band is allowed to relax, each chain becomes soft, and the molecules striking it lose energy as they pound into the relaxing chain."
7935,So the temperature falls.
7936,"We have seen how these two processes, contraction when heated and cooling during relaxation, can be related by the kinetic theory, but it would be a tremendous challenge to determine from the theory the precise relationship between the two."
7937,"We would have to know how many collisions there were each second and what the chains look like, and we would have to take account of all kinds of other complications."
7938,"The detailed mechanism is so complex that we cannot, by kinetic theory, really determine exactly what happens; still, a definite relation between the two effects we observe can be worked out without knowing anything about the internal machinery!"
7939,"The whole subject of thermodynamics depends essentially upon the following kind of consideration: because a rubber band is “stronger” at higher temperatures than it is at lower temperatures, it ought to be possible to lift weights, and to move them around, and thus to do work with heat."
7940,"In fact, we have already seen experimentally that a heated rubber band can lift a weight."
7941,The study of the way that one does work with heat is the beginning of the science of thermodynamics.
7942,Can we make an engine which uses the heating effect on a rubber band to do work?
7943,One can make a silly looking engine that does just this.
7944,It consists of a bicycle wheel in which all the spokes are rubber bands (Fig.
7945,44–2).
7946,"If one heats the rubber bands on one side of the wheel with a pair of heat lamps, they become “stronger” than the rubber bands on the other side."
7947,"The center of gravity of the wheel will be pulled to one side, away from the bearing, so that the wheel turns."
7948,"As it turns, cool rubber bands move toward the heat, and the heated bands move away from the heat and cool, so that the wheel turns slowly so long as the heat is applied."
7949,The efficiency of this engine is extremely low.
7950,"Four hundred watts of power pour into the two lamps, but it is just possible to lift a fly with such an engine!"
7951,"An interesting question, however, is whether we can get heat to do the work in more efficient ways."
7952,"In fact, the science of thermodynamics began with an analysis, by the great engineer Sadi Carnot, of the problem of how to build the best and most efficient engine, and this constitutes one of the few famous cases in which engineering has contributed fundamentally to physical theory."
7953,Another example that comes to mind is the more recent analysis of information theory by Claude Shannon.
7954,"These two analyses, incidentally, turn out to be closely related."
7955,"Now the way a steam engine ordinarily operates is that heat from a fire boils some water, and the steam so formed expands and pushes on a piston which makes a wheel go around."
7956,So the steam pushes the piston—what then?
7957,"One has to finish the job: a stupid way to complete the cycle would be to let the steam escape into the air, for then one has to keep supplying water."
7958,"It is cheaper—more efficient—to let the steam go into another box, where it is condensed by cool water, and then pump the water back into the boiler, so that it circulates continuously."
7959,Heat is thus supplied to the engine and converted into work.
7960,Now would it be better to use alcohol?
7961,What property should a substance have so that it makes the best possible engine?
7962,"That was the question to which Carnot addressed himself, and one of the by-products was the discovery of the type of relationship that we have just explained above."
7963,The results of thermodynamics are all contained implicitly in certain apparently simple statements called the laws of thermodynamics.
7964,"At the time when Carnot lived, the first law of thermodynamics, the conservation of energy, was not known."
7965,"Carnot’s arguments were so carefully drawn, however, that they are valid even though the first law was not known in his time!"
7966,"Some time afterwards, Clapeyron made a simpler derivation that could be understood more easily than Carnot’s very subtle reasoning."
7967,"But it turned out that Clapeyron assumed, not the conservation of energy in general, but that heat was conserved according to the caloric theory, which was later shown to be false."
7968,So it has often been said that Carnot’s logic was wrong.
7969,But his logic was quite correct.
7970,"Only Clapeyron’s simplified version, that everybody read, was incorrect."
7971,The so-called second law of thermodynamics was thus discovered by Carnot before the first law!
7972,"It would be interesting to give Carnot’s argument that did not use the first law, but we shall not do so because we want to learn physics, not history."
7973,"We shall use the first law from the start, in spite of the fact that a great deal can be done without it."
7974,"Let us begin by stating the first law, the conservation of energy: if one has a system and puts heat into it, and does work on it, then its energy is increased by the heat put in and the work done."
7975,"We know that very well, from an earlier chapter."
7976,"Now, what about the second law of thermodynamics?"
7977,"We know that if we do work against friction, say, the work lost to us is equal to the heat produced."
7978,What about the reverse possibility?
7979,Is it possible to convert the heat back into work at a given temperature?
7980,The second law of thermodynamics asserts that it is not.
7981,It would be very convenient to be able to convert heat into work merely by reversing a process like friction.
7982,"If we consider only the conservation of energy, we might think that heat energy, such as that in the vibrational motions of molecules, might provide a goodly supply of useful energy."
7983,But Carnot assumed that it is impossible to extract the energy of heat at a single temperature.
7984,"In other words, if the whole world were at the same temperature, one could not convert any of its heat energy into work: while the process of making work go into heat can take place at a given temperature, one cannot reverse it to get the work back again."
7985,"Specifically, Carnot assumed that heat cannot be taken in at a certain temperature and converted into work with no other change in the system or the surroundings."
7986,That last phrase is very important.
7987,"Suppose we have a can of compressed air at a certain temperature, and we let the air expand."
7988,"It can do work; it can make hammers go, for example."
7989,"It cools off a little in the expansion, but if we had a big sea, like the ocean, at a given temperature—a heat reservoir—we could warm it up again."
7990,"So we have taken the heat out of the sea, and we have done work with the compressed air."
7991,"But Carnot was not wrong, because we did not leave everything as it was."
7992,"We must talk only about situations in which the net result of the whole process is to take heat away and convert it into work, just as the net result of the process of doing work against friction is to take work and convert it into heat."
7993,"If we move in a circle, we can bring the system back precisely to its starting point, with the net result that we did work against friction and produced heat."
7994,Can we reverse the process?
7995,"Turn a switch, so that everything goes backwards, so the friction does work against us, and cools the sea?"
7996,According to Carnot: no!
7997,So let us suppose that this is impossible.
7998,"If it were possible it would mean, among other things, that we could take heat out of a cold body and put it into a hot body at no cost, as it were."
7999,"Now we know it is natural that a hot thing can warm up a cool thing; if we simply put a hot body and a cold one together, and change nothing else, our experience assures us that it is not going to happen that the hot one gets hotter, and the cold one gets colder!"
8000,"But if we could obtain work by extracting the heat out of the ocean, say, or from anything else at a single temperature, then that work could be converted back into heat by friction at some other temperature."
8001,"For instance, the other arm of a working machine could be rubbing something that is already hot."
8002,"The net result would be to take heat from a “cold” body, the ocean, and to put it into a hot body."
8003,"Now, the hypothesis of Carnot, the second law of thermodynamics, is sometimes stated as follows: heat cannot, of itself, flow from a cold to a hot object."
8004,"But, as we have just seen, these two statements are equivalent: first, that one cannot devise a process whose only result is to convert heat to work at a single temperature, and second, that one cannot make heat flow by itself from a cold to a hot place."
8005,We shall mostly use the first form.
8006,Carnot’s analysis of heat engines is quite similar to the argument that we gave about weight-lifting engines in our discussion of the conservation of energy in Chapter 4.
8007,"In fact, that argument was patterned after Carnot’s argument about heat engines, and so the present treatment will sound very much the same."
8008,44–3).
8009,Now we must analyze our engines.
8010,One thing is clear: we will lose something if the engines contain devices in which there is friction.
8011,The best engine will be a frictionless engine.
8012,"We assume, then, the same idealization that we did when we studied the conservation of energy; that is, a perfectly frictionless engine."
8013,"We must also consider the analog of frictionless motion, “frictionless” heat transfer."
8014,"If we put a hot object at a high temperature against a cold object, so that the heat flows, then it is not possible to make that heat flow in a reverse direction by a very small change in the temperature of either object."
8015,"But when we have a practically frictionless machine, if we push it with a little force one way, it goes that way, and if we push it with a little force the other way, it goes the other way."
8016,We need to find the analog of frictionless motion: heat transfer whose direction we can reverse with only a tiny change.
8017,"If the difference in temperature is finite, that is impossible, but if one makes sure that heat flows always between two things at essentially the same temperature, with just an infinitesimal difference to make it flow in the desired direction, the flow is said to be reversible (Fig."
8018,44–4).
8019,"If we heat the object on the left a little, heat will flow to the right; if we cool it a little, heat will flow to the left."
8020,"So we find that the ideal engine is a so-called reversible engine, in which every process is reversible in the sense that, by minor changes, infinitesimal changes, we can make the engine go in the opposite direction."
8021,"That means that nowhere in the machine must there be any appreciable friction, and nowhere in the machine must there be any place where the heat of the reservoirs, or the flame of the boiler, is in direct contact with something definitely cooler or warmer."
8022,Let us now consider an idealized engine in which all the processes are reversible.
8023,"To show that such a thing is possible in principle, we will give an example of an engine cycle which may or may not be practical, but which is at least reversible, in the sense of Carnot’s idea."
8024,Suppose that we have a gas in a cylinder equipped with a frictionless piston.
8025,The gas is not necessarily a perfect gas.
8026,"The fluid does not even have to be a gas, but to be specific let us say we do have a perfect gas."
8027,"We see that such an isothermal (constant-temperature) expansion, done slowly and gently enough, is a reversible process."
8028,"To understand what we are doing, we shall use a plot (Fig."
8029,44–6) of the pressure of the gas against its volume.
8030,"As the gas expands, the pressure falls."
8031,This time we permit no heat to enter the cylinder.
8032,"Again we perform the expansion slowly, so there is no reason why we cannot reverse it, and we again assume there is no friction."
8033,"The gas continues to expand and the temperature falls, since there is no longer any heat entering the cylinder."
8034,"This kind of expansion, made without adding heat, is called an adiabatic expansion."
8035,"44–5, Step 3)."
8036,"The temperature will rise, and the pressure will follow the curve marked (4)."
8037,"Now the point is that this cycle is reversible, so that we could represent all the steps the other way around."
8038,"If we go around the cycle in one direction, we must do work on the gas; if we go in the other direction, the gas does work on us."
8039,So the area under each of the numbered curves is a measure of the work done by or on the gas in the corresponding step.
8040,It is easy to see that the net work done is the shaded area of the picture.
8041,"Now that we have given a single example of a reversible machine, we shall suppose that other such engines are also possible."
8042,44–7).
8043,Why?
8044,But to obtain useful work from a reservoir at a single temperature with no other changes is impossible according to Carnot’s postulate; it cannot be done.
8045,"It is a property of the world, not a property of a particular engine."
8046,"Of course if we knew the properties of a particular substance, we could work it out and then say that all other substances must give the same amount of work in a reversible engine."
8047,"That is the key idea, the clue by which we can find the relationship between how much, for instance, a rubber band contracts when we heat it, and how much it cools when we let it contract."
8048,"Imagine that we put that rubber band in a reversible machine, and that we make it go around a reversible cycle."
8049,"The net result, the total amount of work done, is that universal function, that great function which is independent of substance."
8050,"So we see that a substance’s properties must be limited in a certain way; one cannot make up anything he wants, or he would be able to invent a substance which he could use to produce more than the maximum allowable work when he carried it around a reversible cycle."
8051,"This principle, this limitation, is the only real rule that comes out of the thermodynamics."
8052,Now the next important step is to find this universal law.
8053,"We can, and will, do so by studying a reversible engine with the one particular substance whose laws we know, a perfect gas."
8054,"It is also possible to obtain the rule by a purely logical argument, using no particular substance at all."
8055,"This is one of the very beautiful pieces of reasoning in physics and we are reluctant not to show it to you, so for those who would like to see it we shall discuss it in just a moment."
8056,But first we shall use the much less abstract and simpler method of direct calculation for a perfect gas.
8057,"Although proved for a perfect gas engine, we know it must be true for any reversible engine at all."
8058,"Now we shall see how this universal law could also be obtained by logical argument, without knowing the properties of any specific substances, as follows."
8059,44–8).
8060,"Therefore we can get all the engines’ properties if we introduce a standard temperature, analyzing everything with that standard temperature."
8061,"Because we assume we are using only reversible engines, we can work from the initial temperature down to the standard temperature and back up to the final temperature again."
8062,We shall define the standard temperature arbitrarily as one degree.
8063,"If we discover that, we have everything."
8064,"It is easy to see that the heat must increase as the temperature increases, for we know that it takes work to run an engine backwards and deliver heat at a higher temperature."
8065,"At this stage we are not going to try to find the formula for the above increasing function of the temperature in terms of our familiar mercury temperature scale, but instead we shall define temperature by a new scale."
8066,At one time “the temperature” was defined arbitrarily by dividing the expansion of water into even degrees of a certain size.
8067,"But when one then measures temperature with a mercury thermometer, one finds that the degrees are no longer even."
8068,But now we can make a definition of temperature which is independent of any particular substance.
8069,44–9).
8070,"If seven times more heat is taken out of a boiler than is delivered at a one-degree condenser, the temperature of the boiler will be called seven degrees, and so forth."
8071,"So, by measuring how much heat is absorbed at different temperatures, we determine the temperature."
8072,"The temperature defined in this way is called the absolute thermodynamic temperature, and it is independent of the substance."
8073,We shall use this definition exclusively from now on.1
8074,"Whenever the engine is reversible, this relationship between the heats must follow."
8075,That is all there is to it: that is the center of the universe of thermodynamics.
8076,"If this is all there is to thermodynamics, why is it considered such a difficult subject?"
8077,"In doing a problem involving a given mass of some substance, the condition of the substance at any moment can be described by telling what its temperature is and what its volume is."
8078,"If we know the temperature and volume of a substance, and that the pressure is some function of the temperature and volume, then we know the internal energy."
8079,"One could say, “I do not want to do it that way."
8080,"Tell me the temperature and the pressure, and I will tell you the volume."
8081,"I can think of the volume as a function of temperature and pressure, and the internal energy as a function of temperature and pressure, and so on.” That is why thermodynamics is hard, because everyone uses a different approach."
8082,"If we could only sit down once and decide on our variables, and stick to them, it would be fairly easy."
8083,Now we start to make deductions.
8084,But can one make conclusions out of it?
8085,We begin.
8086,That is our first conclusion.
8087,Equation (44.7) or (44.12) can be interpreted in a special way.
8088,"Now it is interesting that besides the pressure, which is a function of the temperature and the volume, and the internal energy, which is a function of temperature and volume, we have found another quantity which is a function of the condition, i.e., the entropy of the substance."
8089,"Let us try to explain how we compute it, and what we mean when we call it a “function of the condition.” Consider the system in two different conditions, much as we had in the experiment where we did the adiabatic and isothermal expansions."
8090,"(Incidentally, there is no need that a heat engine have only two reservoirs, it could have three or four different temperatures at which it takes in and delivers heats, and so on.)"
8091,"Then let us connect all these reservoirs, by reversible heat engines, to a single reservoir at the unit temperature."
8092,Let us compute the total amount of entropy which has been delivered.
8093,44–6 by first expanding isothermally and then adiabatically; or we could first expand adiabatically and then isothermally.
8094,44–10 is the same on one route as it is on another.
8095,"It must be the same, because if we went all the way around the cycle, going forward on one path and backward on another, we would have a reversible engine, and there would be no loss of heat to the reservoir at unit temperature."
8096,"It is independent of path, and depends only on the endpoints."
8097,"We can, therefore, say that there is a certain function, which we call the entropy of the substance, that depends only on the condition, i.e., only on the volume and temperature."
8098,"For a long time it was believed that absolute entropy meant nothing—that only differences could be defined—but finally Nernst proposed what he called the heat theorem, which is also called the third law of thermodynamics."
8099,It is very simple.
8100,"We will say what it is, but we will not explain why it is true."
8101,Nernst’s postulate states simply that the entropy of any object at absolute zero is zero.
8102,"To give an illustration of these ideas, let us calculate the entropy of a perfect gas."
8103,"We know that for a reversible adiabatic expansion, no heat is exchanged."
8104,"It can also be determined theoretically by means of Planck’s constant and quantum mechanics, but we shall not study it in this course.]"
8105,Now we shall remark on some of the properties of the entropy of things.
8106,"So for a reversible cycle there is no change in the entropy of anything, including the reservoirs."
8107,"This rule may look like the conservation of energy again, but it is not; it applies only to reversible cycles."
8108,If we include irreversible cycles there is no law of conservation of entropy.
8109,We shall give two examples.
8110,"Suppose, for instance, we put a hot stone in cold water."
8111,How much does the water entropy change?
8112,"So the following proposition is true: in any process that is irreversible, the entropy of the whole world is increased."
8113,Only in reversible processes does the entropy remain constant.
8114,"Since no process is absolutely reversible, there is always at least a small gain in the entropy; a reversible process is an idealization in which we have made the gain of entropy minimal."
8115,"Unfortunately, we are not going to enter into the field of thermodynamics very far."
8116,"Our purpose is only to illustrate the principal ideas involved and the reasons why it is possible to make such arguments, but we will not use thermodynamics very much in this course."
8117,"Thermodynamics is used very often by engineers and, particularly, by chemists."
8118,So we must learn our thermodynamics in practice in chemistry or engineering.
8119,"Because it is not worthwhile duplicating everything, we shall just give some discussion of the origin of the theory, rather than much detail for special applications."
8120,The two laws of thermodynamics are often stated this way:
8121,"That is not a very good statement of the second law; it does not say, for example, that in a reversible cycle the entropy stays the same, and it does not say exactly what the entropy is."
8122,"It is just a clever way of remembering the two laws, but it does not really tell us exactly where we stand."
8123,We have summarized the laws discussed in this chapter in Table 44–1.
8124,"In the next chapter we shall apply these laws to discover the relationship between the heat generated in the expansion of a rubber band, and the extra tension when it is heated."
8125,"Thermodynamics is a rather difficult and complex subject when we come to apply it, and it is not appropriate for us to go very far into the applications in this course."
8126,"The subject is of very great importance, of course, to engineers and chemists, and those who are interested in the subject can learn about the applications in physical chemistry or in engineering thermodynamics."
8127,"There are also good equation reference books, such as Zemansky’s Heat and Thermodynamics, where one can learn more about the subject."
8128,"In the Encyclopedia Britannica, fourteenth edition, one can find excellent articles on thermodynamics and thermochemistry, and in the article on chemistry, the sections on physical chemistry, vaporization, liquefication of gases, and so on."
8129,The subject of thermodynamics is complicated because there are so many different ways of describing the same thing.
8130,"If we wish to describe the behavior of a gas, we can say that the pressure depends on the temperature and on the volume, or we can say that the volume depends on the temperature and the pressure."
8131,So we have a large number of different quantities which can be functions of many different combinations of variables.
8132,"To keep the subject simple in this chapter, we shall decide at the start to use temperature and volume as the independent variables."
8133,"Chemists use temperature and pressure, because they are easier to measure and control in chemical experiments, but we shall use temperature and volume throughout this chapter, except in one place where we shall see how to make the transformation into the chemists’ system of variables."
8134,"We shall first, then, consider only one system of independent variables: temperature and volume."
8135,"Secondly, we shall discuss only two dependent functions: the internal energy and the pressure."
8136,"All the other functions can be derived from these, so it is not necessary to discuss them."
8137,"With these limitations, thermodynamics is still a fairly difficult subject, but it is not quite so impossible!"
8138,First we shall review some mathematics.
8139,"If a quantity is a function of two variables, the idea of the derivative of the quantity requires a little more careful thought than for the case where there is only one variable."
8140,What do we mean by the derivative of the pressure with respect to the temperature?
8141,"Since we have only two independent variables, this notation is redundant, but it will help us keep our wits about us in the thermodynamic jungle of partial derivatives."
8142,Using Eq.
8143,The pressure-volume diagram for the Carnot cycle is shown in Fig.
8144,45–1.
8145,Now we will show that this work done is also given by the shaded area in Fig.
8146,45–1.
8147,"When we apply this idea to the Carnot cycle, we see that as we go around the cycle, paying attention to the sign of the work done by the gas, the net work done by the gas is just the shaded area in Fig."
8148,45–1.
8149,Now we want to evaluate the shaded area geometrically.
8150,The cycle we have used in Fig.
8151,"We are working between adiabatic lines and isothermal lines that are very close together, and the figure described by the heavy lines in Fig."
8152,One can easily show that the shaded area in Fig.
8153,45–2.
8154,The whole of thermodynamics can be deduced from Eq.
8155,"(45.5) and the First Law, which is stated in Eq."
8156,(45.3).
8157,"Equation (45.5) is essentially the Second Law, although it was originally deduced by Carnot in a slightly different form, since he did not use our definition of temperature."
8158,(45.3) and (45.7) are the basic equations from which all the results of the subject can be deduced.
8159,Now let us discuss the meaning of Eq.
8160,(45.7) and see why it answers the questions which we proposed in our last chapter.
8161,"We considered the following problem: in kinetic theory it is obvious that an increase in temperature leads to an increase in pressure, because of the bombardments of the atoms on a piston."
8162,"For the same physical reason, when we let the piston move back, heat is taken out of the gas and, in order to keep the temperature constant, heat will have to be put back in."
8163,"The gas cools when it expands, and the pressure rises when it is heated."
8164,"There must be some connection between these two phenomena, and this connection is given explicitly in Eq."
8165,(45.7).
8166,Equation (45.7) expresses the fundamental interrelationship between these two effects.
8167,That is what we promised we would find when we came to the laws of thermodynamics.
8168,"Without knowing the internal mechanism of the gas, and knowing only that we cannot make perpetual motion of the second type, we can deduce the relationship between the amount of heat needed to maintain a constant temperature when the gas expands, and the pressure change when the gas is heated at constant volume!"
8169,"Now that we have the result we wanted for a gas, let us consider the rubber band."
8170,"When we stretch a rubber band, we find that its temperature rises, and when we heat a rubber band, we find that it pulls itself in."
8171,What is the equation that gives the same relation for a rubber band as Eq.
8172,(45.3) gives for gas?
8173,"(45.3) and (45.8), we see that the rubber band equation is obtained by a mere substitution of one letter for another."
8174,"This equation tells us that if we keep the length of a rubber band fixed and heat the band, we can calculate how much the force will increase in terms of the heat needed to keep the temperature constant when the band is relaxed a little bit."
8175,So we see that the same equation applies to both gas and a rubber band.
8176,Let us see what thermodynamics can tell us about the performance of a battery.
8177,(The answer is that a real battery gets warm when charge moves through the cell.
8178,"The internal energy of the battery is changed, first, because the battery did some work on the outside circuit, and second, because the battery is heated.)"
8179,The remarkable thing is that the second part can again be expressed in terms of the way in which the battery voltage changes with temperature.
8180,"Incidentally, when the charge moves through the cell, chemical reactions occur, and Eq."
8181,(45.9) suggests a nifty way of measuring the amount of energy required to produce a chemical reaction.
8182,"All we need to do is construct a cell that works on the reaction, measure the voltage, and measure how much the voltage changes with temperature when we draw no charge from the battery!"
8183,It turns out that it is technically quite difficult to keep the volume constant.
8184,It is much easier to keep the cell at constant atmospheric pressure.
8185,"For that reason, the chemists do not like any of the equations we have written above: they prefer equations which describe performance under constant pressure."
8186,We started in Eq.
8187,"For example, the fundamental relationship that chemists would use instead of Eq."
8188,Now let us apply the results we have obtained to a number of physical situations.
8189,Consider first the ideal gas.
8190,From kinetic theory we know that the internal energy of a gas depends only on the motion of the molecules and the number of molecules.
8191,Why did we bother to go through this calculation if we already knew the results?
8192,Because we have been using two independent definitions of temperature!
8193,"At one stage we assumed that the kinetic energy of the molecules was proportional to the temperature, an assumption that defines one scale of temperature which we will call the ideal gas scale."
8194,(45.13) is based on the gas scale.
8195,We also call temperatures measured on the gas scale kinetic temperatures.
8196,"Later, we defined the temperature in a second way which was completely independent of any substance."
8197,(45.12).
8198,What we proved here is that the pressure of an ideal gas (defined as one for which the internal energy does not depend on the volume) is proportional to the grand thermodynamic absolute temperature.
8199,We also know that the pressure is proportional to the temperature measured on the gas scale.
8200,"Therefore we can deduce that the kinetic temperature is proportional to the “grand thermodynamic absolute temperature.” That means, of course, that if we were sensible we could make two scales agree."
8201,"Most of the time man chooses trouble for himself, but in this case he made them equal!"
8202,The vaporization of a liquid is another application of the results we have derived.
8203,"The substance in the cylinder is not the ideal gas that we considered earlier; now it may be in the liquid or the vapor phase, or both may be present."
8204,"If we apply sufficient pressure, the substance will condense to a liquid."
8205,"Now if we squeeze still harder, the volume changes very little, and our isothermal line rises rapidly with decreasing volume, as shown at the left in Fig."
8206,45–3.
8207,"If we increase the volume by pulling the piston out, the pressure drops until we reach the point at which the liquid starts to boil, and then vapor starts to form."
8208,"If we pull the piston out farther, all that happens is that more liquid vaporizes."
8209,"When there is part liquid and part vapor in the cylinder, the two phases are in equilibrium—liquid is evaporating and vapor is condensing at the same rate."
8210,"If we make more room for the vapor, more vapor is needed to maintain the pressure, so a little more liquid evaporates, but the pressure remains constant."
8211,On the flat part of the curve in Fig.
8212,"As we continue to increase the volume, there comes a time when there is no more liquid to evaporate."
8213,The lower curve in Fig.
8214,"The pressure in the liquid phase is slightly reduced because liquid expands with an increase in temperature (for most substances, but not for water near the freezing point) and, of course, the vapor pressure is lower at the lower temperature."
8215,"We will now make a cycle out of the two isothermal lines by connecting them (say by adiabatic lines) at both ends of the upper flat section, as shown in Fig."
8216,45–4.
8217,"We are going to use the argument of Carnot, which tells us that the heat added to the substance in changing it from a liquid to a vapor is related to the work done by the substance as it goes around the cycle."
8218,As in the argument immediately preceding Eq.
8219,"This relationship was deduced by Carnot, but it is called the Clausius-Clapeyron equation."
8220,Now let us compare Eq.
8221,(45.14) with the results deduced from kinetic theory.
8222,Equation (45.15) from thermodynamics and Eq.
8223,(45.15) will produce Eq.
8224,(45.16).
8225,"This comparison shows the advantages and disadvantages of thermodynamics over kinetic theory: First of all, Eq."
8226,"(45.14) obtained by thermodynamics is exact, while Eq."
8227,"Second, we may not understand correctly how the gas goes into the liquid; nevertheless, Eq."
8228,"(45.14) is right, while (45.16) is only approximate."
8229,"Third, although our treatment applies to a gas condensing into a liquid, the argument is true for any other change of state."
8230,"For instance, the solid-to-liquid transition has the same kind of curve as that shown in Figs."
8231,45–3 and 45–4.
8232,"Although we may not understand the kinetic theory of the melting process, we nevertheless have a correct equation."
8233,"However, when we can understand the kinetic theory, we have another advantage."
8234,"Equation (45.14) is only a differential relationship, and we have no way of obtaining the constants of integration."
8235,In the kinetic theory we can obtain the constants also if we have a good model that describes the phenomenon completely.
8236,So there are advantages and disadvantages to each.
8237,"When knowledge is weak and the situation is complicated, thermodynamic relations are really the most powerful."
8238,"When the situation is very simple and a theoretical analysis can be made, then it is better to try to get more information from theoretical analysis."
8239,One more example: blackbody radiation.
8240,We have discussed a box containing radiation and nothing else.
8241,We have talked about the equilibrium between the oscillator and the radiation.
8242,"Here is a good example of its power, and its limitations."
8243,"If we make a small hole in our box, how much energy will flow per second through the hole of unit area?"
8244,"In this chapter we discuss the ratchet and pawl, a very simple device which allows a shaft to turn only one way."
8245,"The possibility of having something turn only one way requires some detailed and careful analysis, and there are some very interesting consequences."
8246,"The plan of the discussion came about in attempting to devise an elementary explanation, from the molecular or kinetic point of view, for the fact that there is a maximum amount of work which can be extracted from a heat engine."
8247,"Of course we have seen the essence of Carnot’s argument, but it would be nice to find an explanation which is elementary in the sense that we can see what is happening physically."
8248,"Now, there are complicated mathematical demonstrations which follow from Newton’s laws to demonstrate that we can get only a certain amount of work out when heat flows from one place to another, but there is great difficulty in converting this into an elementary demonstration."
8249,"In short, we do not understand it, although we can follow the mathematics."
8250,"In Carnot’s argument, the fact that more than a certain amount of work cannot be extracted in going from one temperature to another is deduced from another axiom, which is that if everything is at the same temperature, heat cannot be converted to work by means of a cyclic process."
8251,"First, let us back up and try to see, in at least one elementary example, why this simpler statement is true."
8252,"Let us try to invent a device which will violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics, that is, a gadget which will generate work from a heat reservoir with everything at the same temperature."
8253,"Let us say we have a box of gas at a certain temperature, and inside there is an axle with vanes in it."
8254,(See Fig.
8255,"Because of the bombardments of gas molecules on the vane, the vane oscillates and jiggles."
8256,All we have to do is to hook onto the other end of the axle a wheel which can turn only one way—the ratchet and pawl.
8257,"Then when the shaft tries to jiggle one way, it will not turn, and when it jiggles the other, it will turn."
8258,"Then the wheel will slowly turn, and perhaps we might even tie a flea onto a string hanging from a drum on the shaft, and lift the flea!"
8259,Now let us ask if this is possible.
8260,"According to Carnot’s hypothesis, it is impossible."
8261,"But if we just look at it, we see, prima facie, that it seems quite possible."
8262,So we must look more closely.
8263,"Indeed, if we look at the ratchet and pawl, we see a number of complications."
8264,"First, our idealized ratchet is as simple as possible, but even so, there is a pawl, and there must be a spring in the pawl."
8265,"The pawl must return after coming off a tooth, so the spring is necessary."
8266,"Another feature of this ratchet and pawl, not shown in the figure, is quite essential."
8267,Suppose the device were made of perfectly elastic parts.
8268,"After the pawl is lifted off the end of the tooth and is pushed back by the spring, it will bounce against the wheel and continue to bounce."
8269,"Then, when another fluctuation came, the wheel could turn the other way, because the tooth could get underneath during the moment when the pawl was up!"
8270,Therefore an essential part of the irreversibility of our wheel is a damping or deadening mechanism which stops the bouncing.
8271,"When the damping happens, of course, the energy that was in the pawl goes into the wheel and shows up as heat."
8272,"So, as it turns, the wheel will get hotter and hotter."
8273,"To make the thing simpler, we can put a gas around the wheel to take up some of the heat."
8274,"Anyway, let us say the gas keeps rising in temperature, along with the wheel."
8275,Will it go on forever?
8276,No!
8277,"This motion is such that, every once in a while, by accident, the pawl lifts itself up and over a tooth just at the moment when the Brownian motion on the vanes is trying to turn the axle backwards."
8278,"And as things get hotter, this happens more often."
8279,"So, this is the reason this device does not work in perpetual motion."
8280,"When the vanes get kicked, sometimes the pawl lifts up and goes over the end."
8281,"But sometimes, when it tries to turn the other way, the pawl has already lifted due to the fluctuations of the motions on the wheel side, and the wheel goes back the other way!"
8282,The net result is nothing.
8283,"It is not hard to demonstrate that when the temperature on both sides is equal, there will be no net average motion of the wheel."
8284,"Of course the wheel will do a lot of jiggling this way and that way, but it will not do what we would like, which is to turn just one way."
8285,Let us look at the reason.
8286,It is necessary to do work against the spring in order to lift the pawl to the top of a tooth.
8287,So the number of times that the pawl is up and the wheel can turn backwards freely is equal to the number of times that we have enough energy to turn it forward when the pawl is down.
8288,"We thus get a “balance,” and the wheel will not go around."
8289,Let us now go further.
8290,We would now like to see if it can lift weights.
8291,"Onto the drum in the middle we tie a string, and put a weight, such as our flea, on the string."
8292,"We want to find how much weight it can lift, how fast it goes around, and so on."
8293,"First we consider a forward motion, the usual way one designs a ratchet to run."
8294,"In order to make one step forward, how much energy has to be borrowed from the vane end?"
8295,"Actually, it is not only a question of getting the energy, but we also would like to know the number of times per second it has this energy."
8296,It will cancel out in the end anyway.
8297,"All the energy taken out goes to lift the weight and to drive the pawl, which then falls back and gives heat to the other side."
8298,"Now we look at the opposite case, which is backward motion."
8299,What happens here?
8300,To get the wheel to go backwards all we have to do is supply the energy to lift the pawl high enough so that the ratchet will slip.
8301,"When this happens, the work is released because the wheel slips backward."
8302,It takes a little thinking to see the reason for that.
8303,Suppose the pawl has lifted itself up accidentally by a fluctuation.
8304,"Then when it falls back and the spring pushes it down against the tooth, there is a force trying to turn the wheel, because the tooth is pushing on an inclined plane."
8305,"This force is doing work, and so is the force due to the weights."
8306,"So both together make up the total force, and all the energy which is slowly released appears at the vane end as heat."
8307,"(Of course it must, by conservation of energy, but one must be careful to think the thing through!)"
8308,"We notice that all these energies are exactly the same, but reversed."
8309,"So, depending upon which of these two rates is greater, the weight is either slowly lifted or slowly released."
8310,"Of course, it is constantly jiggling around, going up for a while and down for a while, but we are talking about the average behavior."
8311,Suppose that for a particular weight the rates happen to be equal.
8312,Then we add an infinitesimal weight to the string.
8313,"The weight will slowly go down, and work will be done on the machine."
8314,Energy will be taken from the wheel and given to the vanes.
8315,"If instead we take off a little bit of weight, then the imbalance is the other way."
8316,"The weight is lifted, and heat is taken from the vane and put into the wheel."
8317,"So we have the conditions of Carnot’s reversible cycle, provided that the weight is just such that these two are equal."
8318,Let us say that the machine is slowly lifting the weight.
8319,"We see that our device cannot extract more work than this, operating reversibly."
8320,"This is the result that we expected from Carnot’s argument, and the main result of this lecture."
8321,"However, we can use our device to understand a few other phenomena, even out of equilibrium, and therefore beyond the range of thermodynamics."
8322,Let us now calculate how fast our one-way device would turn if everything were at the same temperature and we hung a weight on the drum.
8323,"If we pull very, very hard, of course, there are all kinds of complications."
8324,"The pawl slips over the ratchet, or the spring breaks, or something."
8325,But suppose we pull gently enough that everything works nicely.
8326,"In those circumstances, the above analysis is right for the probability of the wheel going forward and backward, if we remember that the two temperatures are equal."
8327,46–2.
8328,The angular velocity that was obtained from different forces is thus very unsymmetrical.
8329,Going one way it is easy: we get a lot of angular velocity for a little force.
8330,"Going the other way, we can put on a lot of force, and yet the wheel hardly goes around."
8331,We find the same thing in an electrical rectifier.
8332,"Instead of the force, we have the electric field, and instead of the angular velocity, we have the electric current."
8333,"In the case of a rectifier, the voltage is not proportional to resistance, and the situation is unsymmetrical."
8334,The same analysis that we made for the mechanical rectifier will also work for an electrical rectifier.
8335,"In fact, the kind of formula we obtained above is typical of the current-carrying capacities of rectifiers as a function of their voltages."
8336,"Now let us take all the weights away, and look at the original machine."
8337,"But what is hard to believe, at first sight, is the opposite."
8338,"A dynamic ratchet with lots of heat in it runs itself backwards, because the ratchet pawl is bouncing."
8339,"If the pawl, for a moment, is on the incline somewhere, it pushes the inclined plane sideways."
8340,"But it is always pushing on an inclined plane, because if it happens to lift up high enough to get past the point of a tooth, then the inclined plane slides by, and it comes down again on an inclined plane."
8341,So a hot ratchet and pawl is ideally built to go around in a direction exactly opposite to that for which it was originally designed!
8342,"In spite of all our cleverness of lopsided design, if the two temperatures are exactly equal there is no more propensity to turn one way than the other."
8343,"The moment we look at it, it may be turning one way or the other, but in the long run, it gets nowhere."
8344,The fact that it gets nowhere is really the fundamental deep principle on which all of thermodynamics is based.
8345,"What deeper mechanical principle tells us that, in the long run, if the temperature is kept the same everywhere, our gadget will turn neither to the right nor to the left?"
8346,"We evidently have a fundamental proposition that there is no way to design a machine which, left to itself, will be more likely to be turning one way than the other after a long enough time."
8347,We must try to see how this follows from the laws of mechanics.
8348,"The laws of mechanics go something like this: the mass times the acceleration is the force, and the force on each particle is some complicated function of the positions of all the other particles."
8349,"There are other situations in which forces depend on velocity, such as in magnetism, but let us not consider that now."
8350,"We take a simpler case, such as gravity, where forces depend only on position."
8351,"In a complicated enough system, the solutions are very complicated, and what happens with time turns out to be very surprising."
8352,"If we write down any arrangement we please for the particles, we will see this arrangement actually occur if we wait long enough!"
8353,"If we follow our solution for a long enough time, it tries everything that it can do, so to speak."
8354,"This is not absolutely necessary in the simplest devices, but when systems get complicated enough, with enough atoms, it happens."
8355,Now there is something else the solution can do.
8356,"This means that if we have a certain motion, then the exact opposite motion is also possible."
8357,"In the complete confusion which comes if we wait long enough, it finds itself going one way sometimes, and it finds itself going the other way sometimes."
8358,There is nothing more beautiful about one of the motions than about the other.
8359,"So it is impossible to design a machine which, in the long run, is more likely to be going one way than the other, if the machine is sufficiently complicated."
8360,One might think up an example for which this is obviously untrue.
8361,"If we take a wheel, for instance, and spin it in empty space, it will go the same way forever."
8362,"So there are some conditions, like the conservation of angular momentum, which violate the above argument."
8363,This just requires that the argument be made with a little more care.
8364,"Perhaps the walls take up the angular momentum, or something like that, so that we have no special conservation laws."
8365,"Then, if the system is complicated enough, the argument is true."
8366,It is based on the fact that the laws of mechanics are reversible.
8367,"For historical interest, we would like to remark on a device invented by Maxwell, who first worked out the dynamical theory of gases."
8368,"He supposed the following situation: We have two boxes of gas at the same temperature, with a little hole between them."
8369,At the hole sits a little demon (who may be a machine of course!).
8370,"There is a door on the hole, which can be opened or closed by the demon."
8371,He watches the molecules coming from the left.
8372,"Whenever he sees a fast molecule, he opens the door."
8373,"When he sees a slow one, he leaves it closed."
8374,"If we want him to be an extra special demon, he can have eyes at the back of his head, and do the opposite to the molecules from the other side."
8375,"He lets the slow ones through to the left, and the fast through to the right."
8376,Pretty soon the left side will get cold and the right side hot.
8377,"Then, are the ideas of thermodynamics violated because we could have such a demon?"
8378,"It turns out, if we build a finite-sized demon, that the demon himself gets so warm that he cannot see very well after a while."
8379,"The simplest possible demon, as an example, would be a trap door held over the hole by a spring."
8380,"A fast molecule comes through, because it is able to lift the trap door."
8381,"The slow molecule cannot get through, and bounces back."
8382,"But this thing is nothing but our ratchet and pawl in another form, and ultimately the mechanism will heat up."
8383,"If we assume that the specific heat of the demon is not infinite, it must heat up."
8384,"It has but a finite number of internal gears and wheels, so it cannot get rid of the extra heat that it gets from observing the molecules."
8385,"Soon it is shaking from Brownian motion so much that it cannot tell whether it is coming or going, much less whether the molecules are coming or going, so it does not work."
8386,Are all the laws of physics reversible?
8387,Evidently not!
8388,Just try to unscramble an egg!
8389,"Run a moving picture backwards, and it takes only a few minutes for everybody to start laughing."
8390,The most natural characteristic of all phenomena is their obvious irreversibility.
8391,Where does irreversibility come from?
8392,It does not come from Newton’s laws.
8393,How then does it come about in nature on a large scale that things are not reversible?
8394,"Obviously there must be some law, some obscure but fundamental equation, perhaps in electricity, maybe in neutrino physics, in which it does matter which way time goes."
8395,Let us discuss that question now.
8396,"We already know one of those laws, which says that the entropy is always increasing."
8397,"If we have a hot thing and a cold thing, the heat goes from hot to cold."
8398,So the law of entropy is one such law.
8399,But we expect to understand the law of entropy from the point of view of mechanics.
8400,"In fact, we have just been successful in obtaining all the consequences of the argument that heat cannot flow backwards by itself from just mechanical arguments, and we thereby obtained an understanding of the Second Law."
8401,Apparently we can get irreversibility from reversible equations.
8402,But was it only a mechanical argument that we used?
8403,Let us look into it more closely.
8404,"Since our question has to do with the entropy, our problem is to try to find a microscopic description of entropy."
8405,"If we say we have a certain amount of energy in something, like a gas, then we can get a microscopic picture of it, and say that every atom has a certain energy."
8406,All these energies added together give us the total energy.
8407,"Similarly, maybe every atom has a certain entropy."
8408,"If we add everything up, we would have the total entropy."
8409,"It does not work so well, but let us see what happens."
8410,"As an example, we calculate the entropy difference between a gas at a certain temperature at one volume, and a gas at the same temperature at another volume."
8411,Let us now consider another interesting example.
8412,Suppose we have a box with a barrier in the middle.
8413,"On one side is neon (“black” molecules), and on the other, argon (“white” molecules)."
8414,"Now we take out the barrier, and let them mix."
8415,How much has the entropy changed?
8416,"It is possible to imagine that instead of the barrier we have a piston, with holes in it that let the whites through but not the blacks, and another kind of piston which is the other way around."
8417,"If we move one piston to each end, we see that, for each gas, the problem is like the one we just solved."
8418,"It is not a property of the molecule itself, but of how much room the molecule has to run around in."
8419,"This is a strange situation, where entropy increases but where everything has the same temperature and the same energy!"
8420,The only thing that is changed is that the molecules are distributed differently.
8421,"We well know that if we just pull the barrier out, everything will get mixed up after a long time, due to the collisions, the jiggling, the banging, and so on."
8422,"Every once in a while a white molecule goes toward a black, and a black one goes toward a white, and maybe they pass."
8423,"Gradually the whites worm their way, by accident, across into the space of blacks, and the blacks worm their way, by accident, into the space of whites."
8424,If we wait long enough we get a mixture.
8425,"Clearly, this is an irreversible process in the real world, and ought to involve an increase in the entropy."
8426,Here we have a simple example of an irreversible process which is completely composed of reversible events.
8427,"Every time there is a collision between any two molecules, they go off in certain directions."
8428,"If we took a moving picture of a collision in reverse, there would be nothing wrong with the picture."
8429,"In fact, one kind of collision is just as likely as another."
8430,"So the mixing is completely reversible, and yet it is irreversible."
8431,"Everyone knows that if we started with white and with black, separated, we would get a mixture within a few minutes."
8432,"If we sat and looked at it for several more minutes, it would not separate again but would stay mixed."
8433,So we have an irreversibility which is based on reversible situations.
8434,But we also see the reason now.
8435,"We started with an arrangement which is, in some sense, ordered."
8436,"Due to the chaos of the collisions, it becomes disordered."
8437,It is the change from an ordered arrangement to a disordered arrangement which is the source of the irreversibility.
8438,"It is true that if we took a motion picture of this, and showed it backwards, we would see it gradually become ordered."
8439,"Someone would say, “That is against the laws of physics!” So we would run the film over again, and we would look at every collision."
8440,"Every one would be perfect, and every one would be obeying the laws of physics."
8441,"The reason, of course, is that every molecule’s velocities are just right, so if the paths are all followed back, they get back to their original condition."
8442,But that is a very unlikely circumstance to have.
8443,"If we start with the gas in no special arrangement, just whites and blacks, it will never get back."
8444,So we now have to talk about what we mean by disorder and what we mean by order.
8445,It is not a question of pleasant order or unpleasant disorder.
8446,What is different in our mixed and unmixed cases is the following.
8447,Suppose we divide the space into little volume elements.
8448,"If we have white and black molecules, how many ways could we distribute them among the volume elements so that white is on one side, and black on the other?"
8449,"On the other hand, how many ways could we distribute them with no restriction on which goes where?"
8450,"Clearly, there are many more ways to arrange them in the latter case."
8451,"We measure “disorder” by the number of ways that the insides can be arranged, so that from the outside it looks the same."
8452,The logarithm of that number of ways is the entropy.
8453,"The number of ways in the separated case is less, so the entropy is less, or the “disorder” is less."
8454,So with the above technical definition of disorder we can understand the proposition.
8455,"First, the entropy measures the disorder."
8456,"Second, the universe always goes from “order” to “disorder,” so entropy always increases."
8457,"Order is not order in the sense that we like the arrangement, but in the sense that the number of different ways we can hook it up, and still have it look the same from the outside, is relatively restricted."
8458,"In the case where we reversed our motion picture of the gas mixing, there was not as much disorder as we thought."
8459,Every single atom had exactly the correct speed and direction to come out right!
8460,"The entropy was not high after all, even though it appeared so."
8461,What about the reversibility of the other physical laws?
8462,"When we talked about the electric field which comes from an accelerating charge, it was said that we must take the retarded field."
8463,"So it looks, at first, as if the law of electricity is not reversible."
8464,"Very strangely, however, the laws we used come from a set of equations called Maxwell’s equations, which are, in fact, reversible."
8465,"This apparent irreversibility in electricity, at least in an enclosure, is thus not an irreversibility at all."
8466,"We have some feeling for that already, because we know that when we have an oscillating charge which generates fields which are bounced from the walls of an enclosure we ultimately get to an equilibrium in which there is no one-sidedness."
8467,The retarded field approach is only a convenience in the method of solution.
8468,"So far as we know, all the fundamental laws of physics, like Newton’s equations, are reversible."
8469,Then where does irreversibility come from?
8470,"It comes from order going to disorder, but we do not understand this until we know the origin of the order."
8471,Why is it that the situations we find ourselves in every day are always out of equilibrium?
8472,One possible explanation is the following.
8473,Look again at our box of mixed white and black molecules.
8474,"Now it is possible, if we wait long enough, by sheer, grossly improbable, but possible, accident, that the distribution of molecules gets to be mostly white on one side and mostly black on the other."
8475,"After that, as times goes on and accidents continue, they get more mixed up again."
8476,Thus one possible explanation of the high degree of order in the present-day world is that it is just a question of luck.
8477,"Perhaps our universe happened to have had a fluctuation of some kind in the past, in which things got somewhat separated, and now they are running back together again."
8478,"This kind of theory is not unsymmetrical, because we can ask what the separated gas looks like either a little in the future or a little in the past."
8479,"In either case, we see a grey smear at the interface, because the molecules are mixing again."
8480,"No matter which way we run time, the gas mixes."
8481,So this theory would say the irreversibility is just one of the accidents of life.
8482,We would like to argue that this is not the case.
8483,"Suppose we do not look at the whole box at once, but only at a piece of the box."
8484,"Then, at a certain moment, suppose we discover a certain amount of order."
8485,"In this little piece, white and black are separate."
8486,What should we deduce about the condition in places where we have not yet looked?
8487,"If we really believe that the order arose from complete disorder by a fluctuation, we must surely take the most likely fluctuation which could produce it, and the most likely condition is not that the rest of it has also become disentangled!"
8488,"Therefore, from the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation, all of the predictions are that if we look at a part of the world we have never seen before, we will find it mixed up, and not like the piece we just looked at."
8489,"If our order were due to a fluctuation, we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it."
8490,Now we assume the separation is because the past of the universe was really ordered.
8491,"It is not due to a fluctuation, but the whole thing used to be white and black."
8492,"This theory now predicts that there will be order in other places—the order is not due to a fluctuation, but due to a much higher ordering at the beginning of time."
8493,Then we would expect to find order in places where we have not yet looked.
8494,"The astronomers, for example, have only looked at some of the stars."
8495,"Every day they turn their telescopes to other stars, and the new stars are doing the same thing as the other stars."
8496,"We therefore conclude that the universe is not a fluctuation, and that the order is a memory of conditions when things started."
8497,This is not to say that we understand the logic of it.
8498,"For some reason, the universe at one time had a very low entropy for its energy content, and since then the entropy has increased."
8499,So that is the way toward the future.
8500,"That is the origin of all irreversibility, that is what makes the processes of growth and decay, that makes us remember the past and not the future, remember the things which are closer to that moment in the history of the universe when the order was higher than now, and why we are not able to remember things where the disorder is higher than now, which we call the future."
8501,"So, as we commented in an earlier chapter, the entire universe is in a glass of wine, if we look at it closely enough."
8502,"In this case the glass of wine is complex, because there is water and glass and light and everything else."
8503,"Another delight of our subject of physics is that even simple and idealized things, like the ratchet and pawl, work only because they are part of the universe."
8504,The ratchet and pawl works in only one direction because it has some ultimate contact with the rest of the universe.
8505,"If the ratchet and pawl were in a box and isolated for some sufficient time, the wheel would be no more likely to go one way than the other."
8506,"But because we pull up the shades and let the light out, because we cool off on the earth and get heat from the sun, the ratchets and pawls that we make can turn one way."
8507,This one-wayness is interrelated with the fact that the ratchet is part of the universe.
8508,"It is part of the universe not only in the sense that it obeys the physical laws of the universe, but its one-way behavior is tied to the one-way behavior of the entire universe."
8509,It cannot be completely understood until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further from speculation to scientific understanding.
8510,In this chapter we shall discuss the phenomenon of waves.
8511,"This is a phenomenon which appears in many contexts throughout physics, and therefore our attention should be concentrated on it not only because of the particular example considered here, which is sound, but also because of the much wider application of the ideas in all branches of physics."
8512,It was pointed out when we studied the harmonic oscillator that there are not only mechanical examples of oscillating systems but electrical ones as well.
8513,"Waves are related to oscillating systems, except that wave oscillations appear not only as time-oscillations at one place, but propagate in space as well."
8514,We have really already studied waves.
8515,"When we studied light, in learning about the properties of waves in that subject, we paid particular attention to the interference in space of waves from several sources at different locations and all at the same frequency."
8516,"There are two important wave phenomena that we have not yet discussed which occur in light, i.e., electromagnetic waves, as well as in any other form of waves."
8517,The first of these is the phenomenon of interference in time rather than interference in space.
8518,"If we have two sources of sound which have slightly different frequencies and if we listen to both at the same time, then sometimes the waves come with the crests together and sometimes with the crest and trough together (see Fig."
8519,47–1).
8520,"The rising and falling of the sound that results is the phenomenon of beats or, in other words, of interference in time."
8521,The second phenomenon involves the wave patterns which result when the waves are confined within a given volume and reflect back and forth from walls.
8522,"These effects could have been discussed, of course, for the case of electromagnetic waves."
8523,The reason for not having done this is that by using one example we would not generate the feeling that we are actually learning about many different subjects at the same time.
8524,"In order to emphasize the general applicability of waves beyond electrodynamics, we consider here a different example, in particular sound waves."
8525,"Other examples of waves are water waves consisting of long swells that we see coming in to the shore, or the smaller water waves consisting of surface tension ripples."
8526,"As another example, there are two kinds of elastic waves in solids; a compressional (or longitudinal) wave in which the particles of the solid oscillate back and forth along the direction of propagation of the wave (sound waves in a gas are of this kind), and a transverse wave in which the particles of the solid oscillate in a direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation."
8527,"Earthquake waves contain elastic waves of both kinds, generated by a motion at some place in the earth’s crust."
8528,Still another example of waves is found in modern physics.
8529,These are waves which give the probability amplitude of finding a particle at a given place—the “matter waves” which we have already discussed.
8530,Their frequency is proportional to the energy and their wave number is proportional to the momentum.
8531,They are the waves of quantum mechanics.
8532,In this chapter we shall consider only waves for which the velocity is independent of the wavelength.
8533,"This is, for example, the case for light in a vacuum."
8534,"The speed of light is then the same for radiowaves, blue light, green light, or for any other wavelength."
8535,"Because of this behavior, when we began to describe the wave phenomenon we did not notice at first that we had wave propagation."
8536,"Therefore if we were to picture the electric field in space at some instant of time, as in Fig."
8537,"There is, of course, another possibility, i.e., that instead of a source to the left as indicated in Fig."
8538,"There is the additional possibility that more than one wave exists in space at the same time, and so the electric field is the sum of the two fields, each one propagating independently."
8539,This is called the principle of superposition.
8540,The same principle is valid in sound.
8541,"We are familiar with the fact that if a sound is produced, we hear with complete fidelity the same sequence of sounds as was generated."
8542,"If we had high frequencies travelling faster than low frequencies, a short, sharp noise would be heard as a succession of musical sounds."
8543,"Similarly, if red light travelled faster than blue light, a flash of white light would be seen first as red, then as white, and finally as blue."
8544,We are familiar with the fact that this is not the case.
8545,Both sound and light travel with a speed in air which is very nearly independent of frequency.
8546,Examples of wave propagation for which this independence is not true will be considered in Chapter 48.
8547,In the case of light (electromagnetic waves) we gave a rule which determined the electric field at a point as a result of the acceleration of a charge.
8548,"One might expect now that what we should do is give a rule whereby some quality of the air, say the pressure, is determined at a given distance from a source in terms of the source motion, delayed by the travel time of the sound."
8549,In the case of light this procedure was acceptable because all that we knew was that a charge at one place exerts a force on another charge at another place.
8550,The details of propagation from the one place to the other were not absolutely essential.
8551,"In the case of sound, however, we know that it propagates through the air between the source and the hearer, and it is certainly a natural question to ask what, at any given moment, the pressure of the air is."
8552,"We would like, in addition, to know exactly how the air moves."
8553,"In the case of electricity we could accept a rule, since we could say that we do not yet know the laws of electricity, but we cannot make the same remark with regard to sound."
8554,"We would not be satisfied with a rule stating how the sound pressure moves through the air, because the process ought to be understandable as a consequence of the laws of mechanics."
8555,"In short, sound is a branch of mechanics, and so it is to be understood in terms of Newton’s laws."
8556,"The propagation of sound from one place to another is merely a consequence of mechanics and the properties of gases, if it propagates in a gas, or of the properties of liquids or solids, if it propagates through such mediums."
8557,Later we shall derive the properties of light and its wave propagation in a similar way from the laws of electrodynamics.
8558,"We shall give a derivation of the properties of the propagation of sound between the source and the receiver as a consequence of Newton’s laws, and we shall not consider the interaction with the source and the receiver."
8559,Ordinarily we emphasize a result rather than a particular derivation of it.
8560,In this chapter we take the opposite view.
8561,"The point here, in a certain sense, is the derivation itself."
8562,"This problem of explaining new phenomena in terms of old ones, when we know the laws of the old ones, is perhaps the greatest art of mathematical physics."
8563,"The mathematical physicist has two problems: one is to find solutions, given the equations, and the other is to find the equations which describe a new phenomenon."
8564,The derivation here is an example of the second kind of problem.
8565,We shall take the simplest example here—the propagation of sound in one dimension.
8566,To carry out such a derivation it is necessary first to have some kind of understanding of what is going on.
8567,"Fundamentally what is involved is that if an object is moved at one place in the air, we observe that there is a disturbance which travels through the air."
8568,"If we ask what kind of disturbance, we would say that we would expect that the motion of the object produces a change of pressure."
8569,"Of course, if the object is moved gently, the air merely flows around it, but what we are concerned with is a rapid motion, so that there is not sufficient time for such a flow."
8570,"Then, with the motion, the air is compressed and a change of pressure is produced which pushes on additional air."
8571,"This air is in turn compressed, which leads again to an extra pressure, and a wave is propagated."
8572,We now want to formulate such a process.
8573,We have to decide what variables we need.
8574,"In our particular problem we would need to know how much the air has moved, so that the air displacement in the sound wave is certainly one relevant variable."
8575,In addition we would like to describe how the air density changes as it is displaced.
8576,"The air pressure also changes, so this is another variable of interest."
8577,"Then, of course, the air has a velocity, so that we shall have to describe the velocity of the air particles."
8578,The air particles also have accelerations—but as we list these many variables we soon realize that the velocity and acceleration would be known if we knew how the air displacement varies with time.
8579,"As we said, we shall consider the wave in one dimension."
8580,We can do this if we are sufficiently far from the source that what we call the wavefronts are very nearly planes.
8581,We thus make our argument simpler by taking the least complicated example.
8582,Is this description complete?
8583,"It would appear to be far from complete, for we know none of the details of how the air molecules are moving."
8584,"From the point of view of kinetic theory, if we have a higher density of molecules at one place and a lower density adjacent to that place, the molecules would move away from the region of higher density to the one of lower density, so as to equalize this difference."
8585,Apparently we would not get an oscillation and there would be no sound.
8586,"What is necessary to get the sound wave is this situation: as the molecules rush out of the region of higher density and higher pressure, they give momentum to the molecules in the adjacent region of lower density."
8587,"For sound to be generated, the regions over which the density and pressure change must be much larger than the distance the molecules travel before colliding with other molecules."
8588,This distance is the mean free path and the distance between pressure crests and troughs must be much larger than this.
8589,Otherwise the molecules would move freely from the crest to the trough and immediately smear out the wave.
8590,"It is clear that we are going to describe the gas behavior on a scale large compared with the mean free path, and so the properties of the gas will not be described in terms of the individual molecules."
8591,"The displacement, for example, will be the displacement of the center of mass of a small element of the gas, and the pressure or density will be the pressure or density in this region."
8592,We must keep in mind that this description is an approximation which is valid only when these gas properties do not vary too rapidly with distance.
8593,The physics of the phenomenon of sound waves thus involves three features:
8594,Let us consider II first.
8595,"For a gas, a liquid, or a solid, the pressure is some function of the density."
8596,The changes of pressure in sound from the equilibrium value are extremely small.
8597,In sound we use a logarithmic scale of intensities since the sensitivity of the ear is roughly logarithmic.
8598,The displacements and the density changes are correspondingly extremely small.
8599,These large pressure changes lead to new effects which we shall consider later.
8600,Let us now consider I.
8601,47–3.
8602,We can now find the density changes in the following way.
8603,"We now need the third equation, which is the equation of the motion produced by the pressure."
8604,"If we know the relation between the force and the pressure, we can then get the equation of motion."
8605,We now can see whether this equation really does describe the essential properties of sound waves in matter.
8606,"We want to deduce that a sound pulse, or disturbance, will move with a constant speed."
8607,We want to verify that two different pulses can move through each other—the principle of superposition.
8608,We also want to verify that sound can go either to the right or to the left.
8609,All these properties should be contained in this one equation.
8610,An extremely interesting question is that of superposition.
8611,This wave equation is one of the consequences of Maxwell’s equations.
8612,The equations of electrodynamics will lead to the wave equation for light just as the equations of mechanics lead to the wave equation for sound.
8613,"In a sound wave, we would expect that in the region of compression the temperature would be raised, and that in the region of rarefaction the temperature would be lowered."
8614,"Newton was the first to calculate the rate of change of pressure with density, and he supposed that the temperature remained unchanged."
8615,He argued that the heat was conducted from one region to the other so rapidly that the temperature could not rise or fall.
8616,"This argument gives the isothermal speed of sound, and it is wrong."
8617,"The correct deduction was given later by Laplace, who put forward the opposite idea—that the pressure and temperature change adiabatically in a sound wave."
8618,The heat flow from the compressed region to the rarefied region is negligible so long as the wavelength is long compared with the mean free path.
8619,"Under this condition the slight amount of heat flow in a sound wave does not affect the speed, although it gives a small absorption of the sound energy."
8620,"We can expect correctly that this absorption increases as the wavelength approaches the mean free path, but these wavelengths are smaller by factors of about a million than the wavelengths of audible sound."
8621,The actual variation of pressure with density in a sound wave is the one that allows no heat flow.
8622,"In other words, the speed of sound is of the same order of magnitude as the speed of the molecules, and is actually somewhat less than this average speed."
8623,"Of course we could expect such a result, because a disturbance like a change in pressure is, after all, propagated by the motion of the molecules."
8624,"However, such an argument does not tell us the precise propagation speed; it could have turned out that sound was carried primarily by the fastest molecules, or by the slowest molecules."
8625,"Some time ago we discussed in considerable detail the properties of light waves and their interference—that is, the effects of the superposition of two waves from different sources."
8626,In all these analyses we assumed that the frequencies of the sources were all the same.
8627,In this chapter we shall discuss some of the phenomena which result from the interference of two sources which have different frequencies.
8628,It is easy to guess what is going to happen.
8629,"At that point, if it is light, the light is very strong; if it is sound, it is very loud; or if it is electrons, many of them arrive."
8630,"Of course, we would then find variations in the net signal strength."
8631,"Of course, to say that one source is shifting its phase relative to another at a uniform rate is the same as saying that the number of oscillations per second is slightly different for the two."
8632,"So we know the answer: if we have two sources at slightly different frequencies we should find, as a net result, an oscillation with a slowly pulsating intensity."
8633,That is all there really is to the subject!
8634,It is very easy to formulate this result mathematically also.
8635,"Of course the amplitudes may not be the same, either, but we can solve the general problem later; let us first take the case where the amplitudes are equal."
8636,"If we plot the amplitudes of the waves against the time, as in Fig."
8637,"48–1, we see that where the crests coincide we get a strong wave, and where a trough and crest coincide we get practically zero, and then when the crests coincide again we get a strong wave again."
8638,"Mathematically, we need only to add two cosines and rearrange the result somehow."
8639,There exist a number of useful relations among cosines which are not difficult to derive.
8640,Now we can analyze our problem.
8641,But is this the frequency at which the beats are heard?
8642,48–1).
8643,The technical basis for the difference is that the high frequency-wave has a little different phase relationship in the second half-cycle.
8644,"However, there are other, easier ways of doing the same analysis."
8645,If we are now asked for the intensity of the wave of Eq.
8646,"(48.7), we can either take the absolute square of the left side, or of the right side."
8647,Let us take the left side.
8648,"One more way to represent this idea is by means of a drawing, like Fig."
8649,48–2.
8650,"If the two frequencies are exactly equal, their resultant is of fixed length as it keeps revolving, and we get a definite, fixed intensity from the two."
8651,"But if the frequencies are slightly different, the two complex vectors go around at different speeds."
8652,"As the vectors go around, the amplitude of the sum vector gets bigger and smaller, and the intensity thus pulsates."
8653,"It is a relatively simple idea, and there are many different ways of representing the same thing."
8654,The effect is very easy to observe experimentally.
8655,"In the case of acoustics, we may arrange two loudspeakers driven by two separate oscillators, one for each loudspeaker, so that they each make a tone."
8656,We thus receive one note from one source and a different note from the other source.
8657,"If we make the frequencies exactly the same, the resulting effect will have a definite strength at a given space location."
8658,"If we then de-tune them a little bit, we hear some variations in the intensity."
8659,"The farther they are de-tuned, the more rapid are the variations of sound."
8660,The ear has some trouble following variations more rapid than ten or so per second.
8661,We may also see the effect on an oscilloscope which simply displays the sum of the currents to the two speakers.
8662,"If the frequency of pulsing is relatively low, we simply see a sinusoidal wave train whose amplitude pulsates, but as we make the pulsations more rapid we see the kind of wave shown in Fig."
8663,48–1.
8664,"As we go to greater frequency differences, the “bumps” move closer together."
8665,"Also, if the amplitudes are not equal and we make one signal stronger than the other, then we get a wave whose amplitude does not ever become zero, just as we expect."
8666,"Everything works the way it should, both acoustically and electrically."
8667,The opposite phenomenon occurs too!
8668,"The way the “information” is transmitted, the useless kind of information about what kind of car to buy, is that when somebody talks into a microphone the amplitude of the carrier signal is changed in step with the vibrations of sound entering the microphone."
8669,"If we take as the simplest mathematical case the situation where a soprano is singing a perfect note, with perfect sinusoidal oscillations of her vocal cords, then we get a signal whose strength is alternating as shown in Fig."
8670,48–4.
8671,"The audiofrequency alternation is then recovered in the receiver; we get rid of the carrier wave and just look at the envelope which represents the oscillations of the vocal cords, or the sound of the singer."
8672,"The loudspeaker then makes corresponding vibrations at the same frequency in the air, and the listener is then essentially unable to tell the difference, so they say."
8673,"Because of a number of distortions and other subtle effects, it is, in fact, possible to tell whether we are listening to a radio or to a real soprano; otherwise the idea is as indicated above."
8674,"One is the carrier frequency plus the modulation frequency, and the other is the carrier frequency minus the modulation frequency."
8675,48–5.
8676,"These are called side bands; when there is a modulated signal from the transmitter, there are side bands."
8677,"Therefore, when there is a complicated modulation that can be represented as the sum of many cosines,1 we find that the actual transmitter is transmitting over a range of frequencies, namely the carrier frequency plus or minus the maximum frequency that the modulation signal contains."
8678,"Therefore it is absolutely essential to keep the stations a certain distance apart, so that their side bands do not overlap and, also, the receiver must not be so selective that it does not permit reception of the side bands as well as of the main nominal frequency."
8679,"In the case of sound, this problem does not really cause much trouble."
8680,The television problem is more difficult.
8681,"As the electron beam goes across the face of the picture tube, there are various little spots of light and dark."
8682,"Let us consider that the resolution of the picture vertically and horizontally is more or less the same, so that there are the same number of spots per inch along a scan line."
8683,"“But,” one might say, “we have just proved that there were side bands on both sides, and therefore it should be twice that wide.” It turns out that the radio engineers are rather clever."
8684,"If we analyze the modulation signal using not just cosine terms, but cosine and sine terms, to allow for phase differences, we then see that there is a definite, invariant relationship between the side band on the high-frequency side and the side band on the low-frequency side."
8685,What we mean is that there is no new information on that other side band.
8686,"So what is done is to suppress one side band, and the receiver is wired inside such that the information which is missing is reconstituted by looking at the single side band and the carrier."
8687,Single side-band transmission is a clever scheme for decreasing the band widths needed to transmit information.
8688,The next subject we shall discuss is the interference of waves in both space and time.
8689,Suppose that we have two waves travelling in space.
8690,"This might be, for example, the displacement in a sound wave."
8691,Now we want to add two such waves together.
8692,"Suppose we have a wave that is travelling with one frequency, and another wave travelling with another frequency."
8693,We leave to the reader to consider the case where the amplitudes are different; it makes no real difference.
8694,We can add these by the same kind of mathematics we used when we added signal waves.
8695,"So we get the same kind of modulations, naturally, but we see, of course, that those modulations are moving along with the wave."
8696,"In other words, if we added two waves, but these waves were not just oscillating, but also moving in space, then the resultant wave would move along also, at the same speed."
8697,Example: material having an index of refraction.
8698,"At any rate, for each frequency there is a definite wave number, and we want to add two such waves together."
8699,Let us do it just as we did in Eq.
8700,Now let us take the case that the difference between the two waves is relatively small.
8701,"But look, the speed of propagation of the modulation is not the same!"
8702,Let us see if we can understand why.
8703,"Consider two waves, again of slightly different wavelength, as in Fig."
8704,48–1.
8705,"They are out of phase, in phase, out of phase, and so on."
8706,"Now these waves represent, really, the waves in space travelling with slightly different frequencies also."
8707,"Now because the phase velocity, the velocity of the nodes of these two waves, is not precisely the same, something new happens."
8708,"Suppose we ride along with one of the waves and look at the other one; if they both went at the same speed, then the other wave would stay right where it was relative to us, as we ride along on this crest."
8709,We ride on that crest and right opposite us we see a crest; if the two velocities are equal the crests stay on top of each other.
8710,But it is not so that the two velocities are really equal.
8711,"There is only a small difference in frequency and therefore only a small difference in velocity, but because of that difference in velocity, as we ride along the other wave moves slowly forward, say, or behind, relative to our wave."
8712,"So as time goes on, what happens to the node?"
8713,"If we move one wave train just a shade forward, the node moves forward (or backward) a considerable distance."
8714,"That is, the sum of these two waves has an envelope, and as the waves travel along, the envelope rides on them at a different speed."
8715,The group velocity is the speed at which modulated signals would be transmitted.
8716,"If we made a signal, i.e., some kind of change in the wave that one could recognize when he listened to it, a kind of modulation, then that modulation would travel at the group velocity, provided that the modulations were relatively slow."
8717,"(When they are fast, it is much more difficult to analyze.)"
8718,"Now we may show (at long last), that the speed of propagation of x-rays in a block of carbon is not greater than the speed of light, although the phase velocity is greater than the speed of light."
8719,"So although the phases can travel faster than the speed of light, the modulation signals travel slower, and that is the resolution of the apparent paradox!"
8720,"So when all the phases have the same velocity, naturally the group has the same velocity."
8721,Let us now consider one more example of the phase velocity which is extremely interesting.
8722,It has to do with quantum mechanics.
8723,"Equation (48.19) gives the amplitude, and if we take the absolute square, we get the relative probability for finding the particle as a function of position and time."
8724,"This is a constant, which means that the probability is the same to find a particle anywhere."
8725,"Now suppose, instead, that we have a situation where we know that the particle is more likely to be at one place than at another."
8726,We would represent such a situation by a wave which has a maximum and dies out on either side (Fig.
8727,48–6).
8728,"Now in those circumstances, since the square of (48.19) represents the chance of finding a particle somewhere, we know that at a given instant the particle is most likely to be near the center of the “lump,” where the amplitude of the wave is maximum."
8729,"If now we wait a few moments, the waves will move, and after some time the “lump” will be somewhere else."
8730,"If we knew that the particle originally was situated somewhere, classically, we would expect that it would later be elsewhere as a matter of fact, because it has a speed, after all, and a momentum."
8731,"The quantum theory, then, will go into the correct classical theory for the relationship of momentum, energy, and velocity only if the group velocity, the velocity of the modulation, is equal to the velocity that we would obtain classically for a particle of the same momentum."
8732,"It is now necessary to demonstrate that this is, or is not, the case."
8733,Now let us look at the group velocity.
8734,"We have to differentiate a square root, which is not very difficult."
8735,Of course the group velocity must be the velocity of the particle if the interpretation is going to make any sense.
8736,"If we think the particle is over here at one time, and then ten minutes later we think it is over there, as the quantum mechanics said, the distance traversed by the “lump,” divided by the time interval, must be, classically, the velocity of the particle."
8737,We shall now bring our discussion of waves to a close with a few general remarks about the wave equation.
8738,"These remarks are intended to give some view of the future—not that we can understand everything exactly just now, but rather to see what things are going to look like when we study waves a little more."
8739,We showed that for a sound wave the displacements would propagate themselves at a certain speed.
8740,"But the excess pressure also propagates at a certain speed, and so does the excess density."
8741,"So we should expect that the pressure would satisfy the same equation, as indeed it does."
8742,We shall leave it to the reader to prove that it does.
8743,"So the pressure, the displacements, everything, satisfy the same wave equation."
8744,"Usually one sees the wave equation for sound written in terms of pressure instead of in terms of displacement, because the pressure is a scalar and has no direction."
8745,"But the displacement is a vector and has direction, and it is thus easier to analyze the pressure."
8746,The next matter we discuss has to do with the wave equation in three dimensions.
8747,Now what we want to do is to guess what the correct wave equation in three dimensions is.
8748,"Naturally, for the case of sound this can be deduced by going through the same dynamic argument in three dimensions that we made in one dimension."
8749,"Working backwards again, we cannot resist writing down the grand equation which corresponds to the dispersion equation (48.22) for quantum-mechanical waves."
8750,There is still another great thing contained in the wave equation: the fact that any superposition of waves is also a solution.
8751,"So this equation contains all of the quantum mechanics and the relativity that we have been discussing so far, at least so long as it deals with a single particle in empty space with no external potentials or forces on it!"
8752,Now we turn to another example of the phenomenon of beats which is rather curious and a little different.
8753,"Imagine two equal pendulums which have, between them, a rather weak spring connection."
8754,They are made as nearly as possible the same length.
8755,"If we pull one aside and let go, it moves back and forth, and it pulls on the connecting spring as it moves back and forth, and so it really is a machine for generating a force which has the natural frequency of the other pendulum."
8756,"Therefore, as a consequence of the theory of resonance, which we studied before, when we put a force on something at just the right frequency, it will drive it."
8757,"So, sure enough, one pendulum moving back and forth drives the other."
8758,"However, in this circumstance there is a new thing happening, because the total energy of the system is finite, so when one pendulum pours its energy into the other to drive it, it finds itself gradually losing energy, until, if the timing is just right along with the speed, it loses all its energy and is reduced to a stationary condition!"
8759,"Then, of course, it is the other pendulum ball that has all the energy and the first one which has none, and as time goes on we see that it works also in the opposite direction, and that the energy is passed back into the first ball; this is a very interesting and amusing phenomenon."
8760,"We said, however, that this is related to the theory of beats, and we must now explain how we can analyze this motion from the point of view of the theory of beats."
8761,We note that the motion of either of the two balls is an oscillation which has an amplitude which changes cyclically.
8762,"Therefore the motion of one of the balls is presumably analyzable in a different way, in that it is the sum of two oscillations, present at the same time but having two slightly different frequencies."
8763,"Therefore it ought to be possible to find two other motions in this system, and to claim that what we saw was a superposition of the two solutions, because this is of course a linear system."
8764,"Indeed, it is easy to find two ways that we could start the motion, each one of which is a perfect, single-frequency motion—absolutely periodic."
8765,"The motion that we started with before was not strictly periodic, since it did not last; soon one ball was passing energy to the other and so changing its amplitude; but there are ways of starting the motion so that nothing changes and, of course, as soon as we see it we understand why."
8766,"For example, if we made both pendulums go together, then, since they are of the same length and the spring is not then doing anything, they will of course continue to swing like that for all time, assuming no friction and that everything is perfect."
8767,"On the other hand, there is another possible motion which also has a definite frequency: that is, if we move the pendulums oppositely, pulling them aside exactly equal distances, then again they would be in absolutely periodic motion."
8768,"We can appreciate that the spring just adds a little to the restoring force that the gravity supplies, that is all, and the system just keeps oscillating at a slightly higher frequency than in the first case."
8769,Why higher?
8770,"Because the spring is pulling, in addition to the gravitation, and it makes the system a little “stiffer,” so that the frequency of this motion is just a shade higher than that of the other."
8771,"Thus this system has two ways in which it can oscillate with unchanging amplitude: it can either oscillate in a manner in which both pendulums go the same way and oscillate all the time at one frequency, or they could go in opposite directions at a slightly higher frequency."
8772,"Now the actual motion of the thing, because the system is linear, can be represented as a superposition of the two."
8773,"(The subject of this chapter, remember, is the effects of adding two motions with different frequencies.)"
8774,So think what would happen if we combined these two solutions.
8775,"As time goes on, however, the two basic motions proceed independently, so the phase of one relative to the other is slowly shifting."
8776,"That is, the large-amplitude motion will have fallen to zero, and in the meantime, of course, the initially motionless ball will have attained full strength!"
8777,"So we see that we could analyze this complicated motion either by the idea that there is a resonance and that one passes energy to the other, or else by the superposition of two constant-amplitude motions at two different frequencies."
8778,This chapter will consider some of the remarkable phenomena which are a result of confining waves in some finite region.
8779,"We will be led first to discover a few particular facts about vibrating strings, for example, and then the generalization of these facts will give us a principle which is probably the most far-reaching principle of mathematical physics."
8780,Our first example of confining waves will be to confine a wave at one boundary.
8781,Let us take the simple example of a one-dimensional wave on a string.
8782,"One could equally well consider sound in one dimension against a wall, or other situations of a similar nature, but the example of a string will be sufficient for our present purposes."
8783,"Suppose that the string is held at one end, for example by fastening it to an “infinitely solid” wall."
8784,But we have next to satisfy the condition that the string does not move at one end.
8785,If this result is put back into Eq.
8786,"We say hypothetical because, of course, there is no string to vibrate on that side of the origin."
8787,"These results are equivalent to the following statement: if a wave reaches the clamped end of a string, it will be reflected with a change in sign."
8788,Such a reflection can always be understood by imagining that what is coming to the end of the string comes out upside down from behind the wall.
8789,The next point to be discussed is the reflection of a periodic wave.
8790,"No matter where this point is, the frequency is the same!"
8791,From inspection of Eq.
8792,"Between any two successive nodes, every point moves up and down sinusoidally, but the pattern of motion stays fixed in space."
8793,This is the fundamental characteristic of what we call a mode.
8794,"If one can find a pattern of motion which has the property that at any point the object moves perfectly sinusoidally, and that all points move at the same frequency (though some will move more than others), then we have what is called a mode."
8795,"We can begin with the idea of the reflection of waves, starting with some kind of a bump moving in one direction."
8796,"As time goes on, we would expect the bump to get near one end, and as time goes still further it will become a kind of little wobble, because it is combining with the reversed-image bump which is coming from the other side."
8797,Finally the original bump will disappear and the image bump will move in the other direction to repeat the process at the other end.
8798,"This problem has an easy solution, but an interesting question is whether we can have a sinusoidal motion (the solution just described is periodic, but of course it is not sinusoidally periodic)."
8799,Let us try to put a sinusoidally periodic wave on a string.
8800,"If the string is tied at one end, we know it must look like our earlier solution (49.3)."
8801,"If it is tied at the other end, it has to look the same at the other end."
8802,So the only possibility for periodic sinusoidal motion is that the sine wave must neatly fit into the string length.
8803,"If it does not fit into the string length, then it is not a natural frequency at which the string can continue to oscillate."
8804,"In short, if the string is started with a sine wave shape that just fits in, then it will continue to keep that perfect shape of a sine wave and will oscillate harmonically at some frequency."
8805,"However, it must also be zero at the other end."
8806,"So we have found the following: that a string has a property that it can have sinusoidal motions, but only at certain frequencies."
8807,This is the most important characteristic of confined waves.
8808,"No matter how complicated the system is, it always turns out that there are some patterns of motion which have a perfect sinusoidal time dependence, but with frequencies that are a property of the particular system and the nature of its boundaries."
8809,"In the case of the string we have many different possible frequencies, each one, by definition, corresponding to a mode, because a mode is a pattern of motion which repeats itself sinusoidally."
8810,Figure 49–2 shows the first three modes for a string.
8811,Now the next mode shows two loops with one node in the middle.
8812,"Returning now to the general motion of the string, it turns out that any possible motion can always be analyzed by asserting that more than one mode is operating at the same time."
8813,"In fact, for general motion an infinite number of modes must be excited at the same time."
8814,"To get some idea of this, let us illustrate what happens when there are two modes oscillating at the same time: Suppose that we have the first mode oscillating as shown by the sequence of pictures in Fig."
8815,"49–3, which illustrates the deflection of the string for equally spaced time intervals extending through half a cycle of the lowest frequency."
8816,"Now, at the same time, we suppose that there is an oscillation of the second mode also."
8817,"This means that at the start it has no displacement, but the two halves of the string have oppositely directed velocities."
8818,"Now we recall a general principle relating to linear systems: if there are any two solutions, then their sum is also a solution."
8819,Therefore a third possible motion of the string would be a displacement obtained by adding the two solutions shown in Fig.
8820,49–3.
8821,"The result, also shown in the figure, begins to suggest the idea of a bump running back and forth between the ends of the string, although with only two modes we cannot make a very good picture of it; more modes are needed."
8822,"This result is, in fact, a special case of a great principle for linear systems:"
8823," Any motion at all can be analyzed by assuming that it is the sum of the motions of all the different modes, combined with appropriate amplitudes and phases."
8824,The importance of the principle derives from the fact that each mode is very simple—it is nothing but a sinusoidal motion in time.
8825,"It is true that even the general motion of a string is not really very complicated, but there are other systems, for example the whipping of an airplane wing, in which the motion is much more complicated."
8826,"Nevertheless, even with an airplane wing, we find there is a certain particular way of twisting which has one frequency and other ways of twisting that have other frequencies."
8827,"If these modes can be found, then the complete motion can always be analyzed as a superposition of harmonic oscillations (except when the whipping is of such degree that the system can no longer be considered as linear)."
8828,The next example to be considered is the interesting situation of modes in two dimensions.
8829,Up to this point we have talked only about one-dimensional situations—a stretched string or sound waves in a tube.
8830,"Ultimately we should consider three dimensions, but an easier step will be that to two dimensions."
8831,49–4.
8832,"Now the question is, what are the characteristics of the possible motion?"
8833,We can start with the same procedure used for the string.
8834,"If we had no confinement at all, we would expect waves travelling along with some kind of wave motion."
8835,In this case we can look upon the second function as the reflected wave.
8836,How do we do that?
8837,The solution is related to something we did when studying reflection from crystals.
8838,So we must satisfy the above two conditions if we are to have a mode.
8839,Let us first find the wavelength.
8840,This result is interesting and important enough that we should deduce it by a purely mathematical analysis instead of by an argument about the reflections.
8841,"In addition we shall require that all waves have the same frequency, so that the resulting motion will represent a mode."
8842,49–4.
8843,Now let us take as an example a rectangle whose width is twice the height.
8844,"The most important point to be emphasized about this particular case is that the frequencies are not multiples of each other, nor are they multiples of any number."
8845,The idea that the natural frequencies are harmonically related is not generally true.
8846,"It is not true for a system of more than one dimension, nor is it true for one-dimensional systems which are more complicated than a string with uniform density and tension."
8847,A simple example of the latter is a hanging chain in which the tension is higher at the top than at the bottom.
8848,"If such a chain is set in harmonic oscillation, there are various modes and frequencies, but the frequencies are not simple multiples of any number, nor are the mode shapes sinusoidal."
8849,The modes of more complicated systems are still more elaborate.
8850,"For example, inside the mouth we have a cavity above the vocal cords, and by moving the tongue and the lips, and so forth, we make an open-ended pipe or a closed-ended pipe of different diameters and shapes; it is a terribly complicated resonator, but it is a resonator nevertheless."
8851,"Now when one talks with the vocal cords, they are made to produce some kind of tone."
8852,"The tone is rather complicated and there are many sounds coming out, but the cavity of the mouth further modifies that tone because of the various resonant frequencies of the cavity."
8853,"For instance, a singer can sing various vowels, a, or o, or oo, and so forth, at the same pitch, but they sound different because the various harmonics are in resonance in this cavity to different degrees."
8854,The very great importance of the resonant frequencies of a cavity in modifying the voice sounds can be demonstrated by a simple experiment.
8855,"Since the speed of sound goes as the reciprocal of the square root of the density, the speed of sound may be varied by using different gases."
8856,"If one uses helium instead of air, so that the density is lower, the speed of sound is much higher, and all the frequencies of a cavity will be raised."
8857,"Consequently if one fills one’s lungs with helium before speaking, the character of his voice will be drastically altered even though the vocal cords may still be vibrating at the same frequency."
8858,"Finally we should emphasize that not only do modes exist for complicated continuous systems, but also for very simple mechanical systems."
8859,A good example is the system of two coupled pendulums discussed in the preceding chapter.
8860,In that chapter it was shown that the motion could be analyzed as a superposition of two harmonic motions with different frequencies.
8861,So even this system can be analyzed in terms of harmonic motions or modes.
8862,The string has an infinite number of modes and the two-dimensional surface also has an infinite number of modes.
8863,"In a sense it is a double infinity, if we know how to count infinities."
8864,"But a simple mechanical thing which has only two degrees of freedom, and requires only two variables to describe it, has only two modes."
8865,Let us make a mathematical analysis of these two modes for the case where the pendulums are of equal length.
8866,49–5.
8867,"Without a spring, the force on the first mass is proportional to the displacement of that mass, because of gravity."
8868,"In addition to the force of restoration due to gravitation, there is an additional force pulling the first mass."
8869,The same force in reverse sense acts on the second mass.
8870,"In order to find a motion in which both of the masses move at the same frequency, we must determine how much each mass moves."
8871,Now we see that we have two equations for what looks like two unknowns.
8872,"But there really are not two unknowns, because the whole size of the motion is something that we cannot determine from these equations."
8873,The necessity for both of these equations to be consistent is a requirement that the frequency be something very special.
8874,In this particular case this can be worked out rather easily.
8875,"If there is motion, then the other terms must be equal, giving a quadratic equation to solve."
8876,"These are the “mode shapes,” as can be readily verified by experiment."
8877,A more interesting case results if the pendulums have different lengths.
8878,"The analysis is very similar to that given above, and is left as an exercise for the reader."
8879,"Now let us summarize the ideas discussed above, which are all aspects of what is probably the most general and wonderful principle of mathematical physics."
8880,"If we have a linear system whose character is independent of the time, then the motion does not have to have any particular simplicity, and in fact may be exceedingly complex, but there are very special motions, usually a series of special motions, in which the whole pattern of motion varies exponentially with the time."
8881,"For the vibrating systems that we are talking about now, the exponential is imaginary, and instead of saying “exponentially” we might prefer to say “sinusoidally” with time."
8882,"However, one can be more general and say that the motions will vary exponentially with the time in very special modes, with very special shapes."
8883,The most general motion of the system can always be represented as a superposition of motions involving each of the different exponentials.
8884,"This is worth stating again for the case of sinusoidal motion: a linear system need not be moving in a purely sinusoidal motion, i.e., at a definite single frequency, but no matter how it does move, this motion can be represented as a superposition of pure sinusoidal motions."
8885,"The frequency of each of these motions is a characteristic of the system, and the pattern or waveform of each motion is also a characteristic of the system."
8886,"The general motion in any such system can be characterized by giving the strength and the phase of each of these modes, and adding them all together."
8887,"Another way of saying this is that any linear vibrating system is equivalent to a set of independent harmonic oscillators, with the natural frequencies corresponding to the modes."
8888,We conclude this chapter by remarking on the connection of modes with quantum mechanics.
8889,"In quantum mechanics the vibrating object, or the thing that varies in space, is the amplitude of a probability function that gives the probability of finding an electron, or system of electrons, in a given configuration."
8890,"This amplitude function can vary in space and time, and satisfies, in fact, a linear equation."
8891,"But in quantum mechanics there is a transformation, in that what we call frequency of the probability amplitude is equal, in the classical idea, to energy."
8892,Therefore we can translate the principle stated above to this case by taking the word frequency and replacing it with energy.
8893,"It becomes something like this: a quantum-mechanical system, for example an atom, need not have a definite energy, just as a simple mechanical system does not have to have a definite frequency; but no matter how the system behaves, its behavior can always be represented as a superposition of states of definite energy."
8894,"The energy of each state is a characteristic of the atom, and so is the pattern of amplitude which determines the probability of finding particles in different places."
8895,The general motion can be described by giving the amplitude of each of these different energy states.
8896,This is the origin of energy levels in quantum mechanics.
8897,"Since quantum mechanics is represented by waves, in the circumstance in which the electron does not have enough energy to ultimately escape from the proton, they are confined waves."
8898,"Like the confined waves of a string, there are definite frequencies for the solution of the wave equation for quantum mechanics."
8899,The quantum-mechanical interpretation is that these are definite energies.
8900,"Therefore a quantum-mechanical system, because it is represented by waves, can have definite states of fixed energy; examples are the energy levels of various atoms."
8901,"Pythagoras is said to have discovered the fact that two similar strings under the same tension and differing only in length, when sounded together give an effect that is pleasant to the ear if the lengths of the strings are in the ratio of two small integers."
8902,"If the lengths are as one is to two, they then correspond to the octave in music."
8903,These intervals are generally accepted as “pleasant” sounding chords.
8904,Pythagoras was so impressed by this discovery that he made it the basis of a school—Pythagoreans they were called—which held mystic beliefs in the great powers of numbers.
8905,It was believed that something similar would be found out about the planets—or “spheres.” We sometimes hear the expression: “the music of the spheres.” The idea was that there would be some numerical relationships between the orbits of the planets or between other things in nature.
8906,People usually think that this is just a kind of superstition held by the Greeks.
8907,But is it so different from our own scientific interest in quantitative relationships?
8908,"Pythagoras’ discovery was the first example, outside geometry, of any numerical relationship in nature."
8909,It must have been very surprising to suddenly discover that there was a fact of nature that involved a simple numerical relationship.
8910,Simple measurements of lengths gave a prediction about something which had no apparent connection to geometry—the production of pleasant sounds.
8911,This discovery led to the extension that perhaps a good tool for understanding nature would be arithmetic and mathematical analysis.
8912,The results of modern science justify that point of view.
8913,Pythagoras could only have made his discovery by making an experimental observation.
8914,Yet this important aspect does not seem to have impressed him.
8915,"If it had, physics might have had a much earlier start."
8916,(It is always easy to look back at what someone else has done and to decide what he should have done!)
8917,We might remark on a third aspect of this very interesting discovery: that the discovery had to do with two notes that sound pleasant to the ear.
8918,We may question whether we are any better off than Pythagoras in understanding why only certain sounds are pleasant to our ear.
8919,The general theory of aesthetics is probably no further advanced now than in the time of Pythagoras.
8920,"In this one discovery of the Greeks, there are the three aspects: experiment, mathematical relationships, and aesthetics."
8921,Physics has made great progress on only the first two parts.
8922,This chapter will deal with our present-day understanding of the discovery of Pythagoras.
8923,"Among the sounds that we hear, there is one kind that we call noise."
8924,Noise corresponds to a sort of irregular vibration of the eardrum that is produced by the irregular vibration of some object in the neighborhood.
8925,"If we make a diagram to indicate the pressure of the air on the eardrum (and, therefore, the displacement of the drum) as a function of time, the graph which corresponds to a noise might look like that shown in Fig."
8926,50–1(a).
8927,(Such a noise might correspond roughly to the sound of a stamped foot.)
8928,The sound of music has a different character.
8929,Music is characterized by the presence of more-or-less sustained tones—or musical “notes.” (Musical instruments may make noises as well!)
8930,"The tone may last for a relatively short time, as when a key is pressed on a piano, or it may be sustained almost indefinitely, as when a flute player holds a long note."
8931,What is the special character of a musical note from the point of view of the pressure in the air?
8932,A musical note differs from a noise in that there is a periodicity in its graph.
8933,"There is some uneven shape to the variation of the air pressure with time, and the shape repeats itself over and over again."
8934,An example of a pressure-time function that would correspond to a musical note is shown in Fig.
8935,50–1(b).
8936,"Musicians will usually speak of a musical tone in terms of three characteristics: the loudness, the pitch, and the “quality.” The “loudness” is found to correspond to the magnitude of the pressure changes."
8937,The “pitch” corresponds to the period of time for one repetition of the basic pressure function.
8938,(“Low” notes have longer periods than “high” notes.)
8939,The “quality” of a tone has to do with the differences we may still be able to hear between two notes of the same loudness and pitch.
8940,"An oboe, a violin, or a soprano are still distinguishable even when they sound notes of the same pitch."
8941,The quality has to do with the structure of the repeating pattern.
8942,"Let us consider, for a moment, the sound produced by a vibrating string."
8943,"If we pluck the string, by pulling it to one side and releasing it, the subsequent motion will be determined by the motions of the waves we have produced."
8944,"We know that these waves will travel in both directions, and will be reflected at the ends."
8945,They will slosh back and forth for a long time.
8946,"No matter how complicated the wave is, however, it will repeat itself."
8947,"For that is just the time required for any wave, once started, to reflect off each end and return to its starting position, and be proceeding in the original direction."
8948,The time is the same for waves which start out in either direction.
8949,"Each point on the string will, then, return to its starting position after one period, and again one period later, etc."
8950,The sound wave produced must also have the same repetition.
8951,We see why a plucked string produces a musical tone.
8952,We have discussed in the preceding chapter another way of looking at the motion of a vibrating system.
8953,"We have seen that a string has various natural modes of oscillation, and that any particular kind of vibration that may be set up by the starting conditions can be thought of as a combination—in suitable proportions—of several of the natural modes, oscillating together."
8954,It produces a musical tone.
8955,We have been talking about the motion of the string.
8956,"But the sound, which is the motion of the air, is produced by the motion of the string, so its vibrations too must be composed of the same harmonics—though we are no longer thinking about the normal modes of the air."
8957,"Also, the relative strength of the harmonics may be different in the air than in the string, particularly if the string is “coupled” to the air via a sounding board."
8958,The efficiency of the coupling to the air is different for different harmonics.
8959,There is one slight complication.
8960,For each frequency we may expect that the starting phases will not necessarily be the same for all frequencies.
8961,"It is, however, simpler to use instead both the sine and cosine functions for each frequency."
8962,"It represents a shift of the average value (that is, the “zero” level) of the sound pressure."
8963,With it our formula can take care of any case.
8964,The equality of Eq.
8965,(50.2) is represented schematically in Fig.
8966,50–2.
8967,They are shown schematically and without any particular scale in the figure.)
8968,We have said that any periodic function can be made up in this way.
8969,"We should correct that and say that any sound wave, or any function we ordinarily encounter in physics, can be made up of such a sum."
8970,We need not worry about such functions here.
8971,Now we are able to describe what it is that determines the “quality” of a musical tone.
8972,A tone with only the first harmonic is a “pure” tone.
8973,A tone with many strong harmonics is a “rich” tone.
8974,A violin produces a different proportion of harmonics than does an oboe.
8975,We can “manufacture” various musical tones if we connect several “oscillators” to a loudspeaker.
8976,(An oscillator usually produces a nearly pure simple harmonic function.)
8977,"Then by adjusting the volume control on each oscillator, we can add in any amount we wish of each harmonic—thereby producing tones of different quality."
8978,An electric organ works in much this way.
8979,The “keys” select the frequency of the fundamental oscillator and the “stops” are switches that control the relative proportions of the harmonics.
8980,"By throwing these switches, the organ can be made to sound like a flute, or an oboe, or a violin."
8981,It is interesting that to produce such “artificial” tones we need only one oscillator for each frequency—we do not need separate oscillators for the sine and cosine components.
8982,The ear is not very sensitive to the relative phases of the harmonics.
8983,It pays attention mainly to the total of the sine and cosine parts of each frequency.
8984,Our analysis is more accurate than is necessary to explain the subjective aspect of music.
8985,"The response of a microphone or other physical instrument does depend on the phases, however, and our complete analysis may be needed to treat such cases."
8986,The “quality” of a spoken sound also determines the vowel sounds that we recognize in speech.
8987,The shape of the mouth determines the frequencies of the natural modes of vibration of the air in the mouth.
8988,Some of these modes are set into vibration by the sound waves from the vocal chords.
8989,"In this way, the amplitudes of some of the harmonics of the sound are increased with respect to others."
8990,"When we change the shape of our mouth, harmonics of different frequencies are given preference."
8991,These effects account for the difference between an “e–e–e” sound and an “a–a–a” sound.
8992,We all know that a particular vowel sound—say “e–e–e”—still “sounds like” the same vowel whether we say (or sing) it at a high or a low pitch.
8993,"From the mechanism we describe, we would expect that particular frequencies are emphasized when we shape our mouth for an “e–e–e,” and that they do not change as we change the pitch of our voice."
8994,"So the relation of the important harmonics to the fundamental—that is, the “quality”—changes as we change pitch."
8995,Apparently the mechanism by which we recognize speech is not based on specific harmonic relationships.
8996,What should we say now about Pythagoras’ discovery?
8997,But why should they “sound pleasant” together?
8998,Perhaps we should take our clue from the frequencies of the harmonics.
8999,The second harmonic of the lower shorter string will have the same frequency as the third harmonic of the longer string.
9000,(It is easy to show—or to believe—that a plucked string produces strongly the several lowest harmonics.)
9001,Perhaps we should make the following rules.
9002,Notes sound consonant when they have harmonics with the same frequency.
9003,Notes sound dissonant if their upper harmonics have frequencies near to each other but far enough apart that there are rapid beats between the two.
9004,"Why beats do not sound pleasant, and why unison of the upper harmonics does sound pleasant, is something that we do not know how to define or describe."
9005,"We cannot say from this knowledge of what sounds good, what ought, for example, to smell good."
9006,"In other words, our understanding of it is not anything more general than the statement that when they are in unison they sound good."
9007,It does not permit us to deduce anything more than the properties of concordance in music.
9008,It is easy to check on the harmonic relationships we have described by some simple experiments with a piano.
9009,"If we then sound C, it will produce its own fundamental and some second harmonic."
9010,It is easy to think up many more combinations for this game.
9011,We have stated a rule for consonance in terms of the coincidence of harmonics.
9012,Is this coincidence perhaps the reason that two notes are consonant?
9013,One worker has claimed that two pure tones—tones carefully manufactured to be free of harmonics—do not give the sensations of consonance or dissonance as the relative frequencies are placed at or near the expected ratios.
9014,"(Such experiments are difficult because it is difficult to manufacture pure tones, for reasons that we shall see later.)"
9015,We cannot still be certain whether the ear is matching harmonics or doing arithmetic when we decide that we like a sound.
9016,"Let us return now to the idea that any note—that is, a periodic sound—can be represented by a suitable combination of harmonics."
9017,We would like to show how we can find out what amount of each harmonic is required.
9018,(It is easy to make a cake from a recipe; but can we write down the recipe if we are given a cake?)
9019,Fourier discovered that it was not really very difficult.
9020,We can easily see that this is indeed so.
9021,The average value of a sine or cosine function over one period is zero.
9022,"Over two, or three, or any whole number of periods, it is also zero."
9023,So the average value of all of the terms on the right-hand side of Eq.
9024,Now the average of a sum is the sum of the averages.
9025,The other coefficients are only a little more difficult.
9026,To find them we can use a trick discovered by Fourier.
9027,Suppose we multiply both sides of Eq.
9028,But that is just zero.
9029,The average of almost all of the rest of the terms is also zero.
9030,They both average to zero.
9031,We see that Fourier’s “trick” has acted like a sieve.
9032,So we can summarize our proof and result in the following more elegant mathematical form.
9033,In earlier chapters it was convenient to use the exponential notation for representing simple harmonic motion.
9034,We have used cosine and sine functions in this chapter because it made the derivations perhaps a little clearer.
9035,Our final result of Eq.
9036,We now know how to “analyze” a periodic wave into its harmonic components.
9037,"The procedure is called Fourier analysis, and the separate terms are called Fourier components."
9038,There is one minor exception.
9039,So perhaps we should make the “rule” for physicists that any discontinuous function (which can only be a simplification of a real physical function) should be defined with halfway values at the discontinuities.
9040,"Then any such function—with any finite number of such jumps—as well as all other physically interesting functions, are given correctly by the Fourier sum."
9041,"As an exercise, we suggest that the reader determine the Fourier series for the function shown in Fig."
9042,50–3.
9043,"We thus find that our square wave (with the particular phase chosen) has only odd harmonics, and their amplitudes are in inverse proportion to their frequencies."
9044,Let us check that Eq.
9045,The energy in a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude.
9046,We can also relate this energy to the Fourier coefficients.
9047,"We have shown above, however, [Eqs."
9048,(50.11) and (50.12)] that the integrals of all such terms over one period is zero.
9049,"Finally, in the theory of harmonics there is an important phenomenon which should be remarked upon because of its practical importance—that of nonlinear effects."
9050,"In all the systems that we have been considering so far, we have supposed that everything was linear, that the responses to forces, say the displacements or the accelerations, were always proportional to the forces."
9051,"Or that the currents in the circuits were proportional to the voltages, and so on."
9052,We now wish to consider cases where there is not a strict proportionality.
9053,Such linear and nonlinear responses are shown in the graphs of Fig.
9054,50–4.
9055,Nonlinear responses have several important practical consequences.
9056,We shall discuss some of them now.
9057,First we consider what happens if we apply a pure tone at the input.
9058,50–5.
9059,"The dashed curve gives, for comparison, the response of a linear system."
9060,We see that the output is no longer a cosine function.
9061,It is more peaked at the top and flatter at the bottom.
9062,We say that the output is distorted.
9063,"We know, however, that such a wave is no longer a pure tone, that it will have harmonics."
9064,We can find what the harmonics are.
9065,50–5.
9066,The process of producing a shift of the average value is called rectification.
9067,A nonlinear response will rectify and will produce harmonics of the frequencies at its input.
9068,Another effect which results from a nonlinear response is modulation.
9069,"If our input function contains two (or more) pure tones, the output will have not only their harmonics, but still other frequency components."
9070,(50.29) are just those which gave the constant terms and second harmonic terms we found above.
9071,The last term is new.
9072,"We have two different, but equivalent, ways of looking at the same result."
9073,"We see, then, why the two descriptions are equivalent."
9074,"In summary, we have found that a nonlinear response produces several effects: rectification, generation of harmonics, and modulation, or the generation of components with sum and difference frequencies."
9075,We should notice that all these effects (Eq.
9076,We expect these effects to be much more important for strong signals than for weak ones.
9077,The effects we have been describing have many practical applications.
9078,"First, with regard to sound, it is believed that the ear is nonlinear."
9079,This is believed to account for the fact that with loud sounds we have the sensation that we hear harmonics and also sum and difference frequencies even if the sound waves contain only pure tones.
9080,"The components which are used in sound-reproducing equipment—amplifiers, loudspeakers, etc.—always have some nonlinearity."
9081,"They produce distortions in the sound—they generate harmonics, etc.—which were not present in the original sound."
9082,These new components are heard by the ear and are apparently objectionable.
9083,It is for this reason that “Hi-Fi” equipment is designed to be as linear as possible.
9084,"(Why the nonlinearities of the ear are not “objectionable” in the same way, or how we even know that the nonlinearity is in the loudspeaker rather than in the ear is not clear!)"
9085,"Nonlinearities are quite necessary, and are, in fact, intentionally made large in certain parts of radio transmitting and receiving equipment."
9086,"In an am transmitter the “voice” signal (with frequencies of some kilocycles per second) is combined with the “carrier” signal (with a frequency of some megacycles per second) in a nonlinear circuit called a modulator, to produce the modulated oscillation that is transmitted."
9087,"In the receiver, the components of the received signal are fed to a nonlinear circuit which combines the sum and difference frequencies of the modulated carrier to generate again the voice signal."
9088,"When we discussed the transmission of light, we assumed that the induced oscillations of charges were proportional to the electric field of the light—that the response was linear."
9089,That is indeed a very good approximation.
9090,It is only within the last few years that light sources have been devised (lasers) which produce an intensity of light strong enough so that nonlinear effects can be observed.
9091,It is now possible to generate harmonics of light frequencies.
9092,"When a strong red light passes through a piece of glass, a little bit of blue light—second harmonic—comes out!"
9093,"Although we have finished our quantitative analyses of waves, this added chapter on the subject is intended to give some appreciation, qualitatively, for various phenomena that are associated with waves, which are too complicated to analyze in detail here."
9094,"Since we have been dealing with waves for several chapters, more properly the subject might be called “some of the more complex phenomena associated with waves.”"
9095,"The first topic to be discussed concerns the effects that are produced by a source of waves which is moving faster than the wave velocity, or the phase velocity."
9096,"Let us first consider waves that have a definite velocity, like sound and light."
9097,"Of course the thing is done continuously, not in steps, and therefore, we have a series of wave circles with a common tangent line which goes through the center of the source."
9098,"We see that instead of a source generating spherical waves, as it would if it were standing still, it generates a wavefront which forms a cone in three dimensions, or a pair of lines in two dimensions."
9099,The angle of the cone is very easy to figure out.
9100,"Incidentally, although we implied that it is necessary to have a source of sound, it turns out, very interestingly, that once the object is moving faster than the speed of sound, it will make sound."
9101,"That is, it is not necessary that it have a certain tone vibrational character."
9102,"Any object moving through a medium faster than the speed at which the medium carries waves will generate waves on each side, automatically, just from the motion itself."
9103,"This is simple in the case of sound, but it also occurs in the case of light."
9104,At first one might think nothing can move faster than the speed of light.
9105,"A particle moving faster than the speed of light in the medium will produce a conical wave of light with its apex at the source, like the wave wake from a boat (which is from the same effect, as a matter of fact)."
9106,"By measuring the cone angle, we can determine the speed of the particle."
9107,This is used technically to determine the speeds of particles as one of the methods of determining their energy in high-energy research.
9108,The direction of the light is all that needs to be measured.
9109,"This light is sometimes called Cherenkov radiation, because it was first observed by Cherenkov."
9110,How intense this light should be was analyzed theoretically by Frank and Tamm.
9111,The 1958 Nobel Prize for physics was awarded jointly to all three for this work.
9112,The corresponding circumstances in the case of sound are illustrated in Fig.
9113,"51–2, which is a photograph of an object moving through a gas at a speed greater than the speed of sound."
9114,"The changes in pressure produce a change in refractive index, and with a suitable optical system the edges of the waves can be made visible."
9115,"We see that the object moving faster than the speed of sound does, indeed, produce a conical wave."
9116,But closer inspection reveals that the surface is actually curved.
9117,"It is straight asymptotically, but it is curved near the apex, and we have now to discuss how that can be, which brings us to the second topic of this chapter."
9118,"Wave speed often depends on the amplitude, and in the case of sound the speed depends upon the amplitude in the following way."
9119,"An object moving through the air has to move the air out of the way, so the disturbance produced in this case is some kind of a pressure step, with the pressure higher behind the wavefront than in the undisturbed region not yet reached by the wave (running along at the normal speed, say)."
9120,"But the air that is left behind, after the wavefront passes, has been compressed adiabatically, and therefore the temperature is increased."
9121,"Now the speed of sound increases with the temperature, so the speed in the region behind the jump is faster than in the air in front."
9122,"That means that any other disturbance that is made behind this step, say by a continuous pushing of the body, or any other disturbance, will ride faster than the front, the speed increasing with higher pressure."
9123,"Figure 51–3 illustrates the situation, with some little bumps of pressure added to the pressure contour to aid visualization."
9124,"We see that the higher pressure regions at the rear overtake the front as time goes on, until ultimately the compressional wave develops a sharp front."
9125,"If the strength is very high, “ultimately” means right away; if it as rather weak, it takes a long time; it may be, in fact, that the sound is spreading and dying out before it has time to do this."
9126,"In nature nothing happens infinitely rapidly, presumably, and what we call a “sharp” front has, actually, a very slight thickness; it is not infinitely steep."
9127,"The distances over which it is varying are of the order of one mean free path, in which the theory of the wave equation begins to fail because we did not consider the structure of the gas."
9128,"Now, referring again to Fig."
9129,"That is, the curve is the result of the fact that the speed depends upon the strength of the wave."
9130,"Therefore the wave from an atomic bomb explosion travels much faster than the speed of sound for a while, until it gets so far out that it is weakened to such an extent from spreading that the pressure bump is small compared with atmospheric pressure."
9131,The speed of the bump then approaches the speed of sound in the gas into which it is going.
9132,"(Incidentally, it always turns out that the speed of the shock is higher than the speed of sound in the gas ahead, but is lower than the speed of sound in the gas behind."
9133,"That is, impulses from the back will arrive at the front, but the front rides into the medium in which it is going faster than the normal speed of signals."
9134,"So one cannot tell, acoustically, that the shock is coming until it is too late."
9135,"The light from the bomb arrives first, but one cannot tell that the shock is coming until it arrives, because there is no sound signal coming ahead of it.)"
9136,"This is a very interesting phenomenon, this piling up of waves, and the main point on which it depends is that after a wave is present, the speed of the resulting wave should be higher."
9137,Another example of the same phenomenon is the following.
9138,Consider water flowing in a long channel with finite width and finite depth.
9139,"If a piston, or a wall across the channel, is moved along the channel fast enough, water piles up, like snow before a snow plow."
9140,Now suppose the situation is as shown in Fig.
9141,"51–4, with a sudden step in water height somewhere in the channel."
9142,It can be demonstrated that long waves in a channel travel faster in deeper water than they do in shallow water.
9143,Therefore any new bumps or irregularities in energy supplied by the piston run off forward and pile up at the front.
9144,"Again, ultimately what we have is just water with a sharp front, theoretically."
9145,"However, as Fig."
9146,"51–4 shows, there are complications."
9147,Pictured is a wave coming up a channel; the piston is at the far right end of the channel.
9148,"At first it might have appeared like a well-behaved wave, as one might expect, but farther along the channel, it has become sharper and sharper until the events pictured occurred."
9149,"There is a terrible churning at the surface, as the pieces of water fall down, but it is essentially a very sharp rise with no disturbance of the water ahead."
9150,Actually water is much more complicated than sound.
9151,"However, just to illustrate a point, we will try to analyze the speed of such a so-called bore, in a channel."
9152,The point here is not that this is of any basic importance for our purposes—it is not a great generalization—it is only to illustrate that the laws of mechanics that we already know are capable of explaining the phenomenon.
9153,"Imagine, for a moment, that the water does look something like Fig."
9154,We would like to determine the speed at which the front moves.
9155,Now we apply the equations of conservation of matter and momentum.
9156,Now the next step is to use conservation of momentum.
9157,"We have not discussed the problems of water pressure, or anything in hydrodynamics, but it is clear anyway that the pressure of water at a given depth is just enough to hold up the column of water above it."
9158,Now we must balance the forces against the rate of change of the momentum.
9159,Thus we have to figure out how much more momentum there is in situation (b) in Fig.
9160,51–5 than there was in (a).
9161,"As we will see later, that is only true provided the wavelength of the wave is longer than the depth of the channel."
9162,"We could also do the analogous thing for sound waves—including the conservation of internal energy, not the conservation of entropy, because the shock is irreversible."
9163,"In fact, if one checks the conservation of energy in the bore problem, one finds that energy is not conserved."
9164,"If the height difference is small, it is almost perfectly conserved, but as soon as the height difference becomes very appreciable, there is a net loss of energy."
9165,This is manifested as the falling water and the churning shown in Fig.
9166,51–4.
9167,"In shock waves there is a corresponding apparent loss of energy, from the point of view of adiabatic reactions."
9168,"The energy in the sound wave, behind the shock, goes into heating of the gas after shock passes, corresponding to churning of the water in the bore."
9169,"In working it out, three equations for the sound case turn out to be necessary for solution, and the temperature behind the shock is not the same as the temperature in front, as we have seen."
9170,"Since energy is not available from anywhere, that bore cannot then maintain itself; it is unstable."
9171,"If we were to start a wave of that sort, it would flatten out, because the speed dependence on height that resulted in sharpening in the case we discussed would now have the opposite effect."
9172,The next kind of waves to be discussed are the more complicated waves in solids.
9173,"We have already discussed sound waves in gas and in liquid, and there is a direct analog to a sound wave in a solid."
9174,"If a sudden push is applied to a solid, it is compressed."
9175,"It resists the compression, and a wave analogous to sound is started."
9176,"However there is another kind of wave that is possible in a solid, and which is not possible in a fluid."
9177,"If a solid is distorted by pushing it sideways (called shearing), then it tries to pull itself back."
9178,"That is by definition what distinguishes a solid from a liquid: if we distort a liquid (internally), hold it a minute so that it calms down, and then let go, it will stay that way, but if we take a solid and push it, like shearing a piece of “Jello,” and let it go, it flies back and starts a shear wave, travelling in the same way the compressions travel."
9179,"In all cases, the shear wave speed is less than the speed of longitudinal waves."
9180,"The shear waves are somewhat more analogous, so far as their polarizations are concerned, to light waves."
9181,"Sound has no polarization, it is just a pressure wave."
9182,Light has a characteristic orientation perpendicular to its direction of travel.
9183,"In a solid, the waves are of both kinds."
9184,"First, there is a compression wave, analogous to sound, that runs at one speed."
9185,"If the solid is not crystalline, then a shear wave polarized in any direction will propagate at a characteristic speed."
9186,"(Of course all solids are crystalline, but if we use a block made up of microcrystals of all orientations, the crystal anisotropies average out.)"
9187,"Another interesting question concerning sound waves is the following: What happens if the wavelength in a solid gets shorter, and shorter, and shorter?"
9188,How short can it get?
9189,"It is interesting that it cannot get any shorter than the space between the atoms, because if there is supposed to be a wave in which one point goes up and the next down, etc., the shortest possible wavelength is clearly the atom spacing."
9190,"In terms of the modes of oscillation, we say that there are longitudinal modes, and transverse modes, long wave modes, short wave modes."
9191,"As we consider wavelengths comparable to the spacing between the atoms, then the speeds are no longer constant; there is a dispersion effect where the velocity is not independent of the wave number."
9192,"But, ultimately, the highest mode of transverse waves would be that in which every atom is doing the opposite of neighboring atoms."
9193,"Now from the point of view of atoms, the situation is like the two pendulums that we were talking about, for which there are two modes, one in which they both go together, and the other in which they go apart."
9194,"It is possible to analyze the solid waves another way, in terms of a system of coupled harmonic oscillators, like an enormous number of pendulums, with the highest mode such that they oscillate oppositely, and lower modes with different relationships of the timing."
9195,The shortest wavelengths are so short that they are not usually available technically.
9196,"However they are of great interest because, in the theory of thermodynamics of a solid, the heat properties of a solid, for example specific heats, can be analyzed in terms of the properties of the short sound waves."
9197,"Going to the extreme of sound waves of ever shorter wavelength, one necessarily comes to the individual motions of the atoms; the two things are the same ultimately."
9198,"A very interesting example of sound waves in a solid, both longitudinal and transverse, are the waves that are in the solid earth."
9199,"Who makes the noises we do not know, but inside the earth, from time to time, there are earthquakes—some rock slides past some other rock."
9200,That is like a little noise.
9201,"So waves like sound waves start out from such a source very much longer in wavelength than one usually considers in sound waves, but still they are sound waves, and they travel around in the earth."
9202,"The earth is not homogeneous, however, and the properties, of pressure, density, compressibility, and so on, change with depth, and therefore the speed varies with depth."
9203,Then the waves do not travel in straight lines—there is a kind of index of refraction and they go in curves.
9204,"The longitudinal waves and the transverse waves have different speeds, so there are different solutions for the different speeds."
9205,"Therefore if we place a seismograph at some location and watch the way the thing jiggles after there has been an earthquake somewhere else, then we do not just get an irregular jiggling."
9206,"We might get a jiggling, and a quieting down, and then another jiggling—what happens depends upon the location."
9207,"If it were close enough, we would first receive longitudinal waves from the disturbance, and then, a few moments later, transverse waves, because they travel more slowly."
9208,"By measuring the time difference between the two, we can tell how far away the earthquake is, if we know enough about the speeds and composition of the interior regions involved."
9209,An example of the behavior pattern of waves in the earth is shown in Fig.
9210,51–6.
9211,The two kinds of waves are represented by different symbols.
9212,"If there were an earthquake at the place marked “source,” the transverse waves and longitudinal waves would arrive at different times at the station by the most direct routes, and there would also be reflections at discontinuities, resulting in other paths and times."
9213,It turns out that there is a core in the earth which does not carry transverse waves.
9214,"If the station is opposite the source, transverse waves still arrive, but the timing is not right."
9215,"What happens is that the transverse wave comes to the core, and whenever the transverse waves come to a surface which is oblique, between two materials, two new waves are generated, one transverse and one longitudinal."
9216,"But inside the core of the earth, a transverse wave is not propagated (or at least, there is no evidence for it, only for a longitudinal wave); it comes out again in both forms and comes to the station."
9217,It is from the behavior of these earthquake waves that it has been determined that transverse waves cannot be propagated within the inner circle.
9218,This means that the center of the earth is liquid in the sense that it cannot propagate transverse waves.
9219,The only way we know what is inside the earth is by studying earthquakes.
9220,"So, by using a large number of observations of many earthquakes at different stations, the details have been worked out—the speed, the curves, etc."
9221,are all known.
9222,We know what the speeds of various kinds of waves are at every depth.
9223,"Knowing that, therefore, it is possible to figure out what the normal modes of the earth are, because we know the speed of propagation of sound waves—in other words, the elastic properties of both kinds of waves at every depth."
9224,Suppose the earth were distorted into an ellipsoid and let go.
9225,It is just a matter of superposing waves travelling around in the ellipsoid to determine the period and shapes in a free mode.
9226,"We have figured out that if there is a disturbance, there are a lot of modes, from the lowest, which is ellipsoidal, to higher modes with more structure."
9227,"The Chilean earthquake of May 1960 made a loud enough “noise” that the signals went around the earth many times, and new seismographs of great delicacy were made just in time to determine the frequencies of the fundamental modes of the earth and to compare them with the values that were calculated from the theory of sound with the known velocities, as measured from the independent earthquakes."
9228,The result of this experiment is illustrated in Fig.
9229,"51–7, which is a plot of the strength of the signal versus the frequency of its oscillation (a Fourier analysis)."
9230,Note that at certain particular frequencies there is much more being received than at other frequencies; there are very definite maxima.
9231,"These are the natural frequencies of the earth, because these are the main frequencies at which the earth can oscillate."
9232,"In other words, if the entire motion of the earth is made up of many different modes, we would expect to obtain, for each station, irregular bumpings which indicate a superposition of many frequencies."
9233,"If we analyze this in terms of frequencies, we should be able to find the characteristic frequencies of the earth."
9234,"The vertical dark lines in the figure are the calculated frequencies, and we find a remarkable agreement, an agreement due to the fact that the theory of sound is right for the inside of the earth."
9235,A very curious point is revealed in Fig.
9236,"51–8, which shows a very careful measurement, with better resolution of the lowest mode, the ellipsoidal mode of the earth."
9237,"The reason for the two different frequencies was not known at the time that it was measured, although it may have been found in the meantime."
9238,"There are at least two possible explanations: One would be that there may be asymmetry in the earth’s distribution, which would result in two similar modes."
9239,"Another possibility, which is even more interesting, is this: Imagine the waves going around the earth in two directions from the source."
9240,"The speeds will not be equal because of effects of the rotation of the earth in the equations of motion, which have not been taken into account in making the analysis."
9241,"Motion in a rotating system is modified by Coriolis forces, and these may cause the observed splitting."
9242,"Regarding the method by which these quakes have been analyzed, what is obtained on the seismograph is not a curve of amplitude as a function of frequency, but displacement as a function of time, always a very irregular tracing."
9243,"To find the amount of all the different sine waves for all different frequencies, we know that the trick is to multiply the data by a sine wave of a given frequency and integrate, i.e., average it, and in the average all other frequencies disappear."
9244,"The figures were thus plots of the integrals found when the data were multiplied by sine waves of different cycles per minute, and integrated."
9245,"Now, the next waves of interest, that are easily seen by everyone and which are usually used as an example of waves in elementary courses, are water waves."
9246,"As we shall soon see, they are the worst possible example, because they are in no respects like sound and light; they have all the complications that waves can have."
9247,Let us start with long water waves in deep water.
9248,"If the ocean is considered infinitely deep and a disturbance is made on the surface, waves are generated."
9249,"All kinds of irregular motions occur, but the sinusoidal type motion, with a very small disturbance, might look like the common smooth ocean waves coming in toward the shore."
9250,"Now with such a wave, the water, of course, on the average, is standing still, but the wave moves."
9251,"What is the motion, is it transverse or longitudinal?"
9252,"It must be neither; it is not transverse, nor is it longitudinal."
9253,"Although the water at a given place is alternately trough or hill, it cannot simply be moving up and down, by the conservation of water."
9254,"That is, if it goes down, where is the water going to go?"
9255,The water is essentially incompressible.
9256,"The speed of compression of waves—that is, sound in the water—is much, much higher, and we are not considering that now."
9257,"Since water is incompressible on this scale, as a hill comes down the water must move away from the region."
9258,What actually happens is that particles of water near the surface move approximately in circles.
9259,"When smooth swells are coming, a person floating in a tire can look at a nearby object and see it going in a circle."
9260,"So it is a mixture of longitudinal and transverse, to add to the confusion."
9261,"At greater depths in the water the motions are smaller circles until, reasonably far down, there is nothing left of the motion (Fig."
9262,51–9).
9263,"To find the velocity of such waves is an interesting problem: it must be some combination of the density of the water, the acceleration of gravity, which is the restoring force that makes the waves, and possibly of the wavelength and of the depth."
9264,"If we take the case where the depth goes to infinity, it will no longer depend on the depth."
9265,"Thus if a boat makes waves far out, because there is some sports-car driver in a motorboat travelling by, then after a while the waves come to shore with slow sloshings at first and then more and more rapid sloshings, because the first waves that come are long."
9266,"The waves get shorter and shorter as the time goes on, because the velocities go as the square root of the wavelength."
9267,"One may object, “That is not right, we must look at the group velocity in order to figure it out!” Of course that is true."
9268,The formula for the phase velocity does not tell us what is going to arrive first; what tells us is the group velocity.
9269,"So we have to work out the group velocity, and it is left as a problem to show it to be one-half of the phase velocity, assuming that the velocity goes as the square root of the wavelength, which is all that is needed."
9270,The group velocity also goes as the square root of the wavelength.
9271,How can the group velocity go half as fast as the phase?
9272,"If one looks at the bunch of waves that are made by a boat travelling along, following a particular crest, he finds that it moves forward in the group and gradually gets weaker and dies out in the front, and mystically and mysteriously a weak one in the back works its way forward and gets stronger."
9273,"In short, the waves are moving through the group while the group is only moving at half the speed that the waves are moving."
9274,"Because the group velocities and phase velocities are not equal, then the waves that are produced by an object moving through are no longer simply a cone, but it is much more interesting."
9275,We can see that in Fig.
9276,"51–10, which shows the waves produced by an object moving through the water."
9277,"Note that it is quite different than what we would have for sound, in which the velocity is independent of wavelength, where we would have wavefronts only along the cone, travelling outward."
9278,"Instead of that, we have waves in the back with fronts moving parallel to the motion of the boat, and then we have little waves on the sides at other angles."
9279,"This entire pattern of waves can, with ingenuity, be analyzed by knowing only this: that the phase velocity is proportional to the square root of the wavelength."
9280,The trick is that the pattern of waves is stationary relative to the (constant-velocity) boat; any other pattern would get lost from the boat.
9281,The water waves that we have been considering so far were long waves in which the force of restoration is due to gravitation.
9282,"But when waves get very short in the water, the main restoring force is capillary attraction, i.e., the energy of the surface, the surface tension."
9283,"It is the exact opposite: the phase velocity is higher, the shorter the wavelength, when the wavelength gets very small."
9284,So the velocity of the waves of water is really quite complicated.
9285,The phase velocity as a function of the wavelength is shown in Fig.
9286,"51–11; for very short waves it is fast, for very long waves it is fast, and there is a minimum speed at which the waves can go."
9287,"To the left of the minimum the group velocity is higher than the phase velocity; to the right, the group velocity is less than the phase velocity."
9288,There are a number of interesting phenomena associated with these facts.
9289,"In the first place, since the group velocity is increasing so rapidly as the wavelength goes down, if we make a disturbance there will be a slowest end of the disturbance going at the minimum speed with the corresponding wavelength, and then in front, going at higher speed, will be a short wave and a very long wave."
9290,"It is very hard to see the long ones, but it is easy to see the short ones in a water tank."
9291,"So we see that the ripples often used to illustrate simple waves are quite interesting and complicated; they do not have a sharp wavefront at all, as is the case for simple waves like sound and light."
9292,The main wave has little ripples which run out ahead.
9293,A sharp disturbance in the water does not produce a sharp wave because of the dispersion.
9294,First come the very fine waves.
9295,"Incidentally, if an object moves through the water at a certain speed, a rather complicated pattern results, because all the different waves are going at different speeds."
9296,One can demonstrate this with a tray of water and see that the fastest ones are the fine capillary waves.
9297,"There are slowest waves, of a certain kind, which go behind."
9298,"By inclining the bottom, one sees that where the depth is lower, the speed is lower."
9299,"If a wave comes in at an angle to the line of maximum slope, it bends and tends to follow that line."
9300,"In this way one can show various things, and we conclude that waves are more complicated in water than in air."
9301,"The speed of long waves in water with circulational motions is slower when the depth is less, faster in deep water."
9302,"Thus as water comes toward a beach where the depth lessens, the waves go slower."
9303,"But where the water is deeper, the waves are faster, so we get the effects of shock waves."
9304,"This time, since the wave is not so simple, the shocks are much more contorted, and the wave over-curves itself, in the familiar way shown in Fig."
9305,51–12.
9306,"This is what happens when waves come into the shore, and the real complexities in nature are well revealed in such a circumstance."
9307,No one has yet been able to figure out what shape the wave should take as it breaks.
9308,"It is easy enough when the waves are small, but when one gets large and breaks, then it is much more complicated."
9309,An interesting feature about capillary waves can be seen in the disturbances made by an object moving through the water.
9310,"From the point of view of the object itself, the water is flowing past, and the waves which ultimately sit around it are always the waves which have just the right speed to stay still with the object in the water."
9311,"Similarly, around an object in a stream, with the stream flowing by, the pattern of waves is stationary, and at just the right wavelengths to go at the same speed as the water going by."
9312,"But if the group velocity is less than the phase velocity, then the disturbances propagate out backwards in the stream, because the group velocity is not quite enough to keep up with the stream."
9313,"If the group velocity is faster than the velocity of the phase, the pattern of waves will appear in front of the object."
9314,"If one looks closely at objects in a stream, one can see that there are little ripples in front and long “slurps” in the back."
9315,Another interesting feature of this sort can be observed in pouring liquids.
9316,"If milk is poured fast enough out of a bottle, for instance, a large number of lines can be seen crossing both ways in the outgoing stream."
9317,"They are waves starting from the disturbance at the edges and running out, much like the waves about an object in a stream."
9318,There are effects from both sides which produce the crossed pattern.
9319,"We have investigated some of the interesting properties of waves and the various complications of dependence of phase velocity on wavelength, the speed of the waves on depth, and so forth, that produce the really complex, and therefore interesting, phenomena of nature."
9320,The subject of this chapter is what we may call symmetry in physical laws.
9321,"We have already discussed certain features of symmetry in physical laws in connection with vector analysis (Chapter 11), the theory of relativity (Chapter 16), and rotation (Chapter 20)."
9322,Why should we be concerned with symmetry?
9323,"In the first place, symmetry is fascinating to the human mind, and everyone likes objects or patterns that are in some way symmetrical."
9324,It is an interesting fact that nature often exhibits certain kinds of symmetry in the objects we find in the world around us.
9325,"Perhaps the most symmetrical object imaginable is a sphere, and nature is full of spheres—stars, planets, water droplets in clouds."
9326,"The crystals found in rocks exhibit many different kinds of symmetry, the study of which tells us some important things about the structure of solids."
9327,"Even the animal and vegetable worlds show some degree of symmetry, although the symmetry of a flower or of a bee is not as perfect or as fundamental as is that of a crystal."
9328,But our main concern here is not with the fact that the objects of nature are often symmetrical.
9329,"Rather, we wish to examine some of the even more remarkable symmetries of the universe—the symmetries that exist in the basic laws themselves which govern the operation of the physical world."
9330,"First, what is symmetry?"
9331,How can a physical law be “symmetrical”?
9332,"The problem of defining symmetry is an interesting one and we have already noted that Weyl gave a good definition, the substance of which is that a thing is symmetrical if there is something we can do to it so that after we have done it, it looks the same as it did before."
9333,"For example, a symmetrical vase is of such a kind that if we reflect or turn it, it will look the same as it did before."
9334,"The question we wish to consider here is what we can do to physical phenomena, or to a physical situation in an experiment, and yet leave the result the same."
9335,A list of the known operations under which various physical phenomena remain invariant is shown in Table 52–1.
9336,"The first thing we might try to do, for example, is to translate the phenomenon in space."
9337,"If we do an experiment in a certain region, and then build another apparatus at another place in space (or move the original one over) then, whatever went on in one apparatus, in a certain order in time, will occur in the same way if we have arranged the same condition, with all due attention to the restrictions that we mentioned before: that all of those features of the environment which make it not behave the same way have also been moved over—we talked about how to define how much we should include in those circumstances, and we shall not go into those details again."
9338,"In the same way, we also believe today that displacement in time will have no effect on physical laws."
9339,"(That is, as far as we know today—all of these things are as far as we know today!)"
9340,"That means that if we build a certain apparatus and start it at a certain time, say on Thursday at 10:00 a.m., and then build the same apparatus and start it, say, three days later in the same condition, the two apparatuses will go through the same motions in exactly the same way as a function of time no matter what the starting time, provided again, of course, that the relevant features of the environment are also modified appropriately in time."
9341,"That symmetry means, of course, that if one bought General Motors stock three months ago, the same thing would happen to it if he bought it now!"
9342,"We have to watch out for geographical differences too, for there are, of course, variations in the characteristics of the earth’s surface."
9343,"So, for example, if we measure the magnetic field in a certain region and move the apparatus to some other region, it may not work in precisely the same way because the magnetic field is different, but we say that is because the magnetic field is associated with the earth."
9344,"We can imagine that if we move the whole earth and the equipment, it would make no difference in the operation of the apparatus."
9345,"Another thing that we discussed in considerable detail was rotation in space: if we turn an apparatus at an angle it works just as well, provided we turn everything else that is relevant along with it."
9346,"In fact, we discussed the problem of symmetry under rotation in space in some detail in Chapter 11, and we invented a mathematical system called vector analysis to handle it as neatly as possible."
9347,On a more advanced level we had another symmetry—the symmetry under uniform velocity in a straight line.
9348,"That is to say—a rather remarkable effect—that if we have a piece of apparatus working a certain way and then take the same apparatus and put it in a car, and move the whole car, plus all the relevant surroundings, at a uniform velocity in a straight line, then so far as the phenomena inside the car are concerned there is no difference: all the laws of physics appear the same."
9349,"We even know how to express this more technically, and that is that the mathematical equations of the physical laws must be unchanged under a Lorentz transformation."
9350,"As a matter of fact, it was a study of the relativity problem that concentrated physicists’ attention most sharply on symmetry in physical laws."
9351,"Now the above-mentioned symmetries have all been of a geometrical nature, time and space being more or less the same, but there are other symmetries of a different kind."
9352,"For example, there is a symmetry which describes the fact that we can replace one atom by another of the same kind; to put it differently, there are atoms of the same kind."
9353,"It is possible to find groups of atoms such that if we change a pair around, it makes no difference—the atoms are identical."
9354,"Whatever one atom of oxygen of a certain type will do, another atom of oxygen of that type will do."
9355,"One may say, “That is ridiculous, that is the definition of equal types!” That may be merely the definition, but then we still do not know whether there are any “atoms of the same type”; the fact is that there are many, many atoms of the same type."
9356,Thus it does mean something to say that it makes no difference if we replace one atom by another of the same type.
9357,The so-called elementary particles of which the atoms are made are also identical particles in the above sense—all electrons are the same; all protons are the same; all positive pions are the same; and so on.
9358,"After such a long list of things that can be done without changing the phenomena, one might think we could do practically anything; so let us give some examples to the contrary, just to see the difference."
9359,"Suppose that we ask: “Are the physical laws symmetrical under a change of scale?” Suppose we build a certain piece of apparatus, and then build another apparatus five times bigger in every part, will it work exactly the same way?"
9360,"The answer is, in this case, no!"
9361,"The wavelength of light emitted, for example, by the atoms inside one box of sodium atoms and the wavelength of light emitted by a gas of sodium atoms five times in volume is not five times longer, but is in fact exactly the same as the other."
9362,So the ratio of the wavelength to the size of the emitter will change.
9363,"Another example: we see in the newspaper, every once in a while pictures of a great cathedral made with little matchsticks—a tremendous work of art by some retired fellow who keeps gluing matchsticks together."
9364,It is much more elaborate and wonderful than any real cathedral.
9365,"If we imagine that this wooden cathedral were actually built on the scale of a real cathedral, we see where the trouble is; it would not last—the whole thing would collapse because of the fact that scaled-up matchsticks are just not strong enough."
9366,"“Yes,” one might say, “but we also know that when there is an influence from the outside, it also must be changed in proportion!” We are talking about the ability of the object to withstand gravitation."
9367,"So what we should do is first to take the model cathedral of real matchsticks and the real earth, and then we know it is stable."
9368,Then we should take the larger cathedral and take a bigger earth.
9369,"But then it is even worse, because the gravitation is increased still more!"
9370,"Today, of course, we understand the fact that phenomena depend on the scale on the grounds that matter is atomic in nature, and certainly if we built an apparatus that was so small there were only five atoms in it, it would clearly be something we could not scale up and down arbitrarily."
9371,The scale of an individual atom is not at all arbitrary—it is quite definite.
9372,The fact that the laws of physics are not unchanged under a change of scale was discovered by Galileo.
9373,"He realized that the strengths of materials were not in exactly the right proportion to their sizes, and he illustrated this property that we were just discussing, about the cathedral of matchsticks, by drawing two bones, the bone of one dog, in the right proportion for holding up his weight, and the imaginary bone of a “super dog” that would be, say, ten or a hundred times bigger—that bone was a big, solid thing with quite different proportions."
9374,"We do not know whether he ever carried the argument quite to the conclusion that the laws of nature must have a definite scale, but he was so impressed with this discovery that he considered it to be as important as the discovery of the laws of motion, because he published them both in the same volume, called “On Two New Sciences.”"
9375,"Another example in which the laws are not symmetrical, that we know quite well, is this: a system in rotation at a uniform angular velocity does not give the same apparent laws as one that is not rotating."
9376,"If we make an experiment and then put everything in a space ship and have the space ship spinning in empty space, all alone at a constant angular velocity, the apparatus will not work the same way because, as we know, things inside the equipment will be thrown to the outside, and so on, by the centrifugal or Coriolis forces, etc."
9377,"In fact, we can tell that the earth is rotating by using a so-called Foucault pendulum, without looking outside."
9378,"Next we mention a very interesting symmetry which is obviously false, i.e., reversibility in time."
9379,"The physical laws apparently cannot be reversible in time, because, as we know, all obvious phenomena are irreversible on a large scale: “The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on.” So far as we can tell, this irreversibility is due to the very large number of particles involved, and if we could see the individual molecules, we would not be able to discern whether the machinery was working forward or backwards."
9380,"To make it more precise: we build a small apparatus in which we know what all the atoms are doing, in which we can watch them jiggling."
9381,"Now we build another apparatus like it, but which starts its motion in the final condition of the other one, with all the velocities precisely reversed."
9382,"It will then go through the same motions, but exactly in reverse."
9383,"Putting it another way: if we take a motion picture, with sufficient detail, of all the inner works of a piece of material and shine it on a screen and run it backwards, no physicist will be able to say, “That is against the laws of physics, that is doing something wrong!” If we do not see all the details, of course, the situation will be perfectly clear."
9384,"If we see the egg splattering on the sidewalk and the shell cracking open, and so on, then we will surely say, “That is irreversible, because if we run the moving picture backwards the egg will all collect together and the shell will go back together, and that is obviously ridiculous!” But if we look at the individual atoms themselves, the laws look completely reversible."
9385,"This is, of course, a much harder discovery to have made, but apparently it is true that the fundamental physical laws, on a microscopic and fundamental level, are completely reversible in time!"
9386,"The symmetries of the physical laws are very interesting at this level, but they turn out, in the end, to be even more interesting and exciting when we come to quantum mechanics."
9387,"For a reason which we cannot make clear at the level of the present discussion—a fact that most physicists still find somewhat staggering, a most profound and beautiful thing, is that, in quantum mechanics, for each of the rules of symmetry there is a corresponding conservation law; there is a definite connection between the laws of conservation and the symmetries of physical laws."
9388,"We can only state this at present, without any attempt at explanation."
9389,"The fact, for example, that the laws are symmetrical for translation in space when we add the principles of quantum mechanics, turns out to mean that momentum is conserved."
9390,"That the laws are symmetrical under translation in time means, in quantum mechanics, that energy is conserved."
9391,Invariance under rotation through a fixed angle in space corresponds to the conservation of angular momentum.
9392,"These connections are very interesting and beautiful things, among the most beautiful and profound things in physics."
9393,"Incidentally, there are a number of symmetries which appear in quantum mechanics which have no classical analog, which have no method of description in classical physics."
9394,That is another symmetry.
9395,Physical laws must be of such a nature that a shift in the quantum-mechanical phase makes no difference.
9396,"As we have just mentioned, in quantum mechanics there is a conservation law for every symmetry."
9397,The conservation law which is connected with the quantum-mechanical phase seems to be the conservation of electrical charge.
9398,This is altogether a very interesting business!
9399,"Now the next question, which is going to concern us for most of the rest of this chapter, is the question of symmetry under reflection in space."
9400,The problem is this: Are the physical laws symmetrical under reflection?
9401,"We may put it this way: Suppose we build a piece of equipment, let us say a clock, with lots of wheels and hands and numbers; it ticks, it works, and it has things wound up inside."
9402,We look at the clock in the mirror.
9403,How it looks in the mirror is not the question.
9404,"Now the question is: If the two clocks are started in the same condition, the springs wound to corresponding tightnesses, will the two clocks tick and go around, forever after, as exact mirror images?"
9405,"(This is a physical question, not a philosophical question.)"
9406,Our intuition about the laws of physics would suggest that they would.
9407,"We would suspect that, at least in the case of these clocks, reflection in space is one of the symmetries of physical laws, that if we change everything from “right” to “left” and leave it otherwise the same, we cannot tell the difference."
9408,"Let us, then, suppose for a moment that this is true."
9409,"If it is true, then it would be impossible to distinguish “right” and “left” by any physical phenomenon, just as it is, for example, impossible to define a particular absolute velocity by a physical phenomenon."
9410,"So it should be impossible, by any physical phenomenon, to define absolutely what we mean by “right” as opposed to “left,” because the physical laws should be symmetrical."
9411,"Of course, the world does not have to be symmetrical."
9412,"For example, using what we may call “geography,” surely “right” can be defined."
9413,"For instance, we stand in New Orleans and look at Chicago, and Florida is to our right (when our feet are on the ground!)."
9414,So we can define “right” and “left” by geography.
9415,"Of course, the actual situation in any system does not have to have the symmetry that we are talking about; it is a question of whether the laws are symmetrical—in other words, whether it is against the physical laws to have a sphere like the earth with “left-handed dirt” on it and a person like ourselves standing looking at a city like Chicago from a place like New Orleans, but with everything the other way around, so Florida is on the other side."
9416,"It clearly seems not impossible, not against the physical laws, to have everything changed left for right."
9417,Another point is that our definition of “right” should not depend on history.
9418,An easy way to distinguish right from left is to go to a machine shop and pick up a screw at random.
9419,"The odds are it has a right-hand thread—not necessarily, but it is much more likely to have a right-hand thread than a left-hand one."
9420,"This is a question of history or convention, or the way things happen to be, and is again not a question of fundamental laws."
9421,"As we can well appreciate, everyone could have started out making left-handed screws!"
9422,So we must try to find some phenomenon in which “right hand” is involved fundamentally.
9423,"The next possibility we discuss is the fact that polarized light rotates its plane of polarization as it goes through, say, sugar water."
9424,"As we saw in Chapter 33, it rotates, let us say, to the right in a certain sugar solution."
9425,"That is a way of defining “right-hand,” because we may dissolve some sugar in the water and then the polarization goes to the right."
9426,"But sugar has come from living things, and if we try to make the sugar artificially, then we discover that it does not rotate the plane of polarization!"
9427,"But if we then take that same sugar which is made artificially and which does not rotate the plane of polarization, and put bacteria in it (they eat some of the sugar) and then filter out the bacteria, we find that we still have sugar left (almost half as much as we had before), and this time it does rotate the plane of polarization, but the other way!"
9428,"It seems very confusing, but is easily explained."
9429,Take another example: One of the substances which is common to all living creatures and that is fundamental to life is protein.
9430,Proteins consist of chains of amino acids.
9431,Figure 52–1 shows a model of an amino acid that comes out of a protein.
9432,"This amino acid is called alanine, and the molecular arrangement would look like that in Fig."
9433,52–1(a) if it came out of a protein of a real living thing.
9434,"On the other hand, if we try to make alanine from carbon dioxide, ethane, and ammonia (and we can make it, it is not a complicated molecule), we discover that we are making equal amounts of this molecule and the one shown in Fig."
9435,52–1(b)!
9436,"The first molecule, the one that comes from the living thing, is called L-alanine."
9437,"The other one, which is the same chemically, in that it has the same kinds of atoms and the same connections of the atoms, is a “right-hand” molecule, compared with the “left-hand” L-alanine, and it is called D-alanine."
9438,"The interesting thing is that when we make alanine at home in a laboratory from simple gases, we get an equal mixture of both kinds."
9439,"However, the only thing that life uses is L-alanine."
9440,(This is not exactly true.
9441,"Here and there in living creatures there is a special use for D-alanine, but it is very rare."
9442,All proteins use L-alanine exclusively.)
9443,"Now if we make both kinds, and we feed the mixture to some animal which likes to “eat,” or use up, alanine, it cannot use D-alanine, so it only uses the L-alanine; that is what happened to our sugar—after the bacteria eat the sugar that works well for them, only the “wrong” kind is left!"
9444,"(Left-handed sugar tastes sweet, but not the same as right-handed sugar.)"
9445,"So it looks as though the phenomena of life permit a distinction between “right” and “left,” or chemistry permits a distinction, because the two molecules are chemically different."
9446,"But no, it does not!"
9447,"So far as physical measurements can be made, such as of energy, the rates of chemical reactions, and so on, the two kinds work exactly the same way if we make everything else in a mirror image too."
9448,"One molecule will rotate light to the right, and the other will rotate it to the left in precisely the same amount, through the same amount of fluid."
9449,"Thus, so far as physics is concerned, these two amino acids are equally satisfactory."
9450,"So far as we understand things today, the fundamentals of the Schrödinger equation have it that the two molecules should behave in exactly corresponding ways, so that one is to the right as the other is to the left."
9451,"Nevertheless, in life it is all one way!"
9452,It is presumed that the reason for this is the following.
9453,"Let us suppose, for example, that life is somehow at one moment in a certain condition in which all the proteins in some creatures have left-handed amino acids, and all the enzymes are lopsided—every substance in the living creature is lopsided—it is not symmetrical."
9454,"So when the digestive enzymes try to change the chemicals in the food from one kind to another, one kind of chemical “fits” into the enzyme, but the other kind does not (like Cinderella and the slipper, except that it is a “left foot” that we are testing)."
9455,"So far as we know, in principle, we could build a frog, for example, in which every molecule is reversed, everything is like the “left-hand” mirror image of a real frog; we have a left-hand frog."
9456,"This left-hand frog would go on all right for a while, but he would find nothing to eat, because if he swallows a fly, his enzymes are not built to digest it."
9457,The fly has the wrong “kind” of amino acids (unless we give him a left-hand fly).
9458,"So as far as we know, the chemical and life processes would continue in the same manner if everything were reversed."
9459,"If life is entirely a physical and chemical phenomenon, then we can understand that the proteins are all made in the same corkscrew only from the idea that at the very beginning some living molecules, by accident, got started and a few won."
9460,"Somewhere, once, one organic molecule was lopsided in a certain way, and from this particular thing the “right” happened to evolve in our particular geography; a particular historical accident was one-sided, and ever since then the lopsidedness has propagated itself."
9461,"Once having arrived at the state that it is in now, of course, it will always continue—all the enzymes digest the right things, manufacture the right things: when the carbon dioxide and the water vapor, and so on, go in the plant leaves, the enzymes that make the sugars make them lopsided because the enzymes are lopsided."
9462,"If any new kind of virus or living thing were to originate at a later time, it would survive only if it could “eat” the kind of living matter already present."
9463,"Thus it, too, must be of the same kind."
9464,There is no conservation of the number of right-handed molecules.
9465,"Once started, we could keep increasing the number of right-handed molecules."
9466,"So the presumption is, then, that the phenomena in the case of life do not show a lack of symmetry in physical laws, but do show, on the contrary, the universal nature and the commonness of ultimate origin of all creatures on earth, in the sense described above."
9467,Now we go further.
9468,We observe that in physics there are a lot of other places where we have “right” and “left” hand rules.
9469,"As a matter of fact, when we learned about vector analysis we learned about the right-hand rules we have to use in order to get the angular momentum, torque, magnetic field, and so on, to come out right."
9470,"As a matter of fact, if we go back and look at where the vectors came from, we know that the “right-hand rule” was merely a convention; it was a trick."
9471,"The original quantities, like the angular momenta and the angular velocities, and things of this kind, were not really vectors at all!"
9472,"They are all somehow associated with a certain plane, and it is just because there are three dimensions in space that we can associate the quantity with a direction perpendicular to that plane."
9473,"Of the two possible directions, we chose the “right-hand” direction."
9474,"So if the laws of physics are symmetrical, we should find that if some demon were to sneak into all the physics laboratories and replace the word “right” for “left” in every book in which “right-hand rules” are given, and instead we were to use all “left-hand rules,” uniformly, then it should make no difference whatever in the physical laws."
9475,Let us give an illustration.
9476,There are two kinds of vectors.
9477,"If in our apparatus there is a piece here and something else there, then in a mirror apparatus there will be the image piece and the image something else, and if we draw a vector from the “piece” to the “something else,” one vector is the mirror image of the other (Fig."
9478,52–2).
9479,"The vector arrow changes its head, just as the whole space turns inside out; such a vector we call a polar vector."
9480,"But the other kind of vector, which has to do with rotations, is of a different nature."
9481,"For example, suppose that in three dimensions something is rotating as shown in Fig."
9482,52–3.
9483,"Then if we look at it in a mirror, it will be rotating as indicated, namely, as the mirror image of the original rotation."
9484,"Now we have agreed to represent the mirror rotation by the same rule, it is a “vector” which, on reflection, does not change about as the polar vector does, but is reversed relative to the polar vectors and to the geometry of the space; such a vector is called an axial vector."
9485,"Now if the law of reflection symmetry is right in physics, then it must be true that the equations must be so designed that if we change the sign of each axial vector and each cross-product of vectors, which would be what corresponds to reflection, nothing will happen."
9486,"So if we change our coordinates from right to left, we must also change the poles of magnets from north to south."
9487,Let us see how that works in an example.
9488,"Suppose that we have two magnets, as in Fig."
9489,52–4.
9490,"One is a magnet with the coils going around a certain way, and with current in a given direction."
9491,"The other magnet looks like the reflection of the first magnet in a mirror—the coil will wind the other way, everything that happens inside the coil is exactly reversed, and the current goes as shown."
9492,"Now, from the laws for the production of magnetic fields, which we do not know yet officially, but which we most likely learned in high school, it turns out that the magnetic field is as shown in the figure."
9493,"In one case the pole is a south magnetic pole, while in the other magnet the current is going the other way and the magnetic field is reversed—it is a north magnetic pole."
9494,So we see that when we go from right to left we must indeed change from north to south!
9495,Never mind changing north to south; these too are mere conventions.
9496,Let us talk about phenomena.
9497,"Suppose, now, that we have an electron moving through one field, going into the page."
9498,So the phenomenon is that we have a coil with a current going in a specified sense and an electron curves in a certain way—that is the physics—never mind how we label everything.
9499,"Now let us do the same experiment with a mirror: we send an electron through in a corresponding direction and now the force is reversed, if we calculate it from the same rule, and that is very good because the corresponding motions are then mirror images!"
9500,"So the fact of the matter is that in studying any phenomenon there are always two right-hand rules, or an even number of them, and the net result is that the phenomena always look symmetrical."
9501,"In short, therefore, we cannot tell right from left if we also are not able to tell north from south."
9502,"However, it may seem that we can tell the north pole of a magnet."
9503,"The north pole of a compass needle, for example, is one that points to the north."
9504,"But of course that is again a local property that has to do with geography of the earth; that is just like talking about in which direction is Chicago, so it does not count."
9505,"If we have seen compass needles, we may have noticed that the north-seeking pole is a sort of bluish color."
9506,But that is just due to the man who painted the magnet.
9507,"These are all local, conventional criteria."
9508,"However, if a magnet were to have the property that if we looked at it closely enough we would see small hairs growing on its north pole but not on its south pole, if that were the general rule, or if there were any unique way to distinguish the north from the south pole of a magnet, then we could tell which of the two cases we actually had, and that would be the end of the law of reflection symmetry."
9509,"To illustrate the whole problem still more clearly, imagine that we were talking to a Martian, or someone very far away, by telephone."
9510,"We are not allowed to send him any actual samples to inspect; for instance, if we could send light, we could send him right-hand circularly polarized light and say, “That is right-hand light—just watch the way it is going.” But we cannot give him anything, we can only talk to him."
9511,"He is far away, or in some strange location, and he cannot see anything we can see."
9512,"For instance, we cannot say, “Look at Ursa major; now see how those stars are arranged."
9513,What we mean by ‘right’ is …” We are only allowed to telephone him.
9514,Now we want to tell him all about us.
9515,"Of course, first we start defining numbers, and say, “Tick, tick, two, tick, tick, tick, three, …,” so that gradually he can understand a couple of words, and so on."
9516,"After a while we may become very familiar with this fellow, and he says, “What do you guys look like?” We start to describe ourselves, and say, “Well, we are six feet tall.” He says, “Wait a minute, what is six feet?” Is it possible to tell him what six feet is?"
9517,Certainly!
9518,"And so we define the size of the body, and tell him what the general shape is—it has prongs with five bumps sticking out on the ends, and so on, and he follows us along, and we finish describing how we look on the outside, presumably without encountering any particular difficulties."
9519,He is even making a model of us as we go along.
9520,"He says, “My, you are certainly very handsome fellows; now what is on the inside?” So we start to describe the various organs on the inside, and we come to the heart, and we carefully describe the shape of it, and say, “Now put the heart on the left side.” He says, “Duhhh—the left side?” Now our problem is to describe to him which side the heart goes on without his ever seeing anything that we see, and without our ever sending any sample to him of what we mean by “right”—no standard right-handed object."
9521,Can we do it?
9522,"It turns out that the laws of gravitation, the laws of electricity and magnetism, nuclear forces, all satisfy the principle of reflection symmetry, so these laws, or anything derived from them, cannot be used."
9523,"But associated with the many particles that are found in nature there is a phenomenon called beta decay, or weak decay."
9524,"One of the examples of weak decay, in connection with a particle discovered in about 1954, posed a strange puzzle."
9525,52–5.
9526,Now in Fig.
9527,"52–5 we also see another particle which disintegrates into two mesons; one must be neutral, from the conservation of charge."
9528,"Anyone in his right mind realizes immediately that they must be the same particle, that we merely produce an object which has two different ways of disintegrating—not two different particles."
9529,"This object that can disintegrate in two different ways has, therefore, the same lifetime and the same production ratio (because this is simply the ratio of the odds with which it disintegrates into these two kinds)."
9530,"However, it was possible to prove (and we cannot here explain at all how), from the principle of reflection symmetry in quantum mechanics, that it was impossible to have these both come from the same particle—the same particle could not disintegrate in both of these ways."
9531,"The conservation law corresponding to the principle of reflection symmetry is something which has no classical analog, and so this kind of quantum-mechanical conservation was called the conservation of parity."
9532,"So, it was a result of the conservation of parity or, more precisely, from the symmetry of the quantum-mechanical equations of the weak decays under reflection, that the same particle could not go into both, so it must be some kind of coincidence of masses, lifetimes, and so on."
9533,"But the more it was studied, the more remarkable the coincidence, and the suspicion gradually grew that possibly the deep law of the reflection symmetry of nature may be false."
9534,"As a result of this apparent failure, the physicists Lee and Yang suggested that other experiments be done in related decays to try to test whether the law was correct in other cases."
9535,"The first such experiment was carried out by Miss Wu from Columbia, and was done as follows."
9536,"Using a very strong magnet at a very low temperature, it turns out that a certain isotope of cobalt, which disintegrates by emitting an electron, is magnetic, and if the temperature is low enough that the thermal oscillations do not jiggle the atomic magnets about too much, they line up in the magnetic field."
9537,So the cobalt atoms will all line up in this strong field.
9538,"If one is not really “hep” to the world, such a remark does not sound like anything of significance, but if one appreciates the problems and interesting things in the world, then he sees that it is a most dramatic discovery: When we put cobalt atoms in an extremely strong magnetic field, more disintegration electrons go down than up."
9539,"Therefore if we were to put it in a corresponding experiment in a “mirror,” in which the cobalt atoms would be lined up in the opposite direction, they would spit their electrons up, not down; the action is unsymmetrical."
9540,The magnet has grown hairs!
9541,"In fact, in almost all cases where it could be expected, all have been found not to obey reflection symmetry!"
9542,"Fundamentally, the law of reflection symmetry, at this level in physics, is incorrect."
9543,"In short, we can tell a Martian where to put the heart: we say, “Listen, build yourself a magnet, and put the coils in, and put the current on, and then take some cobalt and lower the temperature."
9544,"Arrange the experiment so the electrons go from the foot to the head, then the direction in which the current goes through the coils is the direction that goes in on what we call the right and comes out on the left.”  So it is possible to define right and left, now, by doing an experiment of this kind."
9545,There are a lot of other features that were predicted.
9546,"The electron carries spin angular momentum, and there is also a neutrino involved."
9547,"It is easy to see from this that the electron must carry its spin angular momentum aligned along its direction of motion, the neutrino likewise."
9548,"So it looks as though the electron is spinning to the left, and that was also checked."
9549,"In fact, it was checked right here at Caltech by Boehm and Wapstra, that the electrons spin mostly to the left."
9550,"(There were some other experiments that gave the opposite answer, but they were wrong!)"
9551,"The next problem, of course, was to find the law of the failure of parity conservation."
9552,What is the rule that tells us how strong the failure is going to be?
9553,"The rule is this: it occurs only in these very slow reactions, called weak decays, and when it occurs, the rule is that the particles which carry spin, like the electron, neutrino, and so on, come out with a spin tending to the left."
9554,"That is a lopsided rule; it connects a polar vector velocity and an axial vector angular momentum, and says that the angular momentum is more likely to be opposite to the velocity than along it."
9555,"Now that is the rule, but today we do not really understand the whys and wherefores of it."
9556,"Why is this the right rule, what is the fundamental reason for it, and how is it connected to anything else?"
9557,At the moment we have been so shocked by the fact that this thing is unsymmetrical that we have not been able to recover enough to understand what it means with regard to all the other rules.
9558,"However, the subject is interesting, modern, and still unsolved, so it seems appropriate that we discuss some of the questions associated with it."
9559,The first thing to do when one of the symmetries is lost is to immediately go back over the list of known or assumed symmetries and ask whether any of the others are lost.
9560,"Now we did not mention one operation on our list, which must necessarily be questioned, and that is the relation between matter and antimatter."
9561,"Dirac predicted that in addition to electrons there must be another particle, called the positron (discovered at Caltech by Anderson), that is necessarily related to the electron."
9562,"The positron is called an antiparticle to the electron, and these are the characteristics of a particle and its antiparticle."
9563,It was clear from Dirac’s argument that all the rest of the particles in the world should also have corresponding antiparticles.
9564,"The most important feature, however, is that a proton and an antiproton coming together can annihilate each other."
9565,"The reason we emphasize this is that people do not understand it when we say there is a neutron and also an antineutron, because they say, “A neutron is neutral, so how can it have the opposite charge?” The rule of the “anti” is not just that it has the opposite charge, it has a certain set of properties, the whole lot of which are opposite."
9566,"Now if we have antineutrons, antiprotons, and antielectrons, we can make antiatoms, in principle."
9567,"They have not been made yet, but it is possible in principle."
9568,"For instance, a hydrogen atom has a proton in the center with an electron going around outside."
9569,"Now imagine that somewhere we can make an antiproton with a positron going around, would it go around?"
9570,"Well, first of all, the antiproton is electrically negative and the antielectron is electrically positive, so they attract each other in a corresponding manner—the masses are all the same; everything is the same."
9571,"It is one of the principles of the symmetry of physics, the equations seem to show, that if a clock, say, were made of matter on one hand, and then we made the same clock of antimatter, it would run in this way."
9572,"(Of course, if we put the clocks together, they would annihilate each other, but that is different.)"
9573,An immediate question then arises.
9574,"Each time one is counted, the second hand moves over."
9575,"Then the mirror clock, receiving fewer electrons, will not run at the same rate."
9576,So evidently we can make two clocks such that the left-hand clock does not agree with the right-hand one.
9577,"Let us make, out of matter, a clock which we call the standard or right-hand clock."
9578,"Now let us make, also out of matter, a clock which we call the left-hand clock."
9579,"We have just discovered that, in general, these two will not run the same way; prior to that famous physical discovery, it was thought that they would."
9580,Now it was also supposed that matter and antimatter were equivalent.
9581,"That is, if we made an antimatter clock, right-hand, the same shape, then it would run the same as the right-hand matter clock, and if we made the same clock to the left it would run the same."
9582,"In other words, in the beginning it was believed that all four of these clocks were the same; now of course we know that the right-hand and left-hand matter are not the same."
9583,"Presumably, therefore, the right-handed antimatter and the left-handed antimatter are not the same."
9584,"So the obvious question is, which goes with which, if either?"
9585,"In other words, does the right-handed matter behave the same way as the right-handed antimatter?"
9586,Or does the right-handed matter behave the same as the left-handed antimatter?
9587,"Therefore, at long last, it is really true that right and left symmetry is still maintained!"
9588,"If we made a left-hand clock, but made it out of the other kind of matter, antimatter instead of matter, it would run in the same way."
9589,"So what has happened is that instead of having two independent rules in our list of symmetries, two of these rules go together to make a new rule, which says that matter to the right is symmetrical with antimatter to the left."
9590,"So if our Martian is made of antimatter and we give him instructions to make this “right” handed model like us, it will, of course, come out the other way around."
9591,"What would happen when, after much conversation back and forth, we each have taught the other to make space ships and we meet halfway in empty space?"
9592,"We have instructed each other on our traditions, and so forth, and the two of us come rushing out to shake hands."
9593,"Well, if he puts out his left hand, watch out!"
9594,"The next question is, what can we make out of laws which are nearly symmetrical?"
9595,"The marvelous thing about it all is that for such a wide range of important, strong phenomena—nuclear forces, electrical phenomena, and even weak ones like gravitation—over a tremendous range of physics, all the laws for these seem to be symmetrical."
9596,"On the other hand, this little extra piece says, “No, the laws are not symmetrical!” How is it that nature can be almost symmetrical, but not perfectly symmetrical?"
9597,What shall we make of this?
9598,"First, do we have any other examples?"
9599,"The answer is, we do, in fact, have a few other examples."
9600,"For instance, the nuclear part of the force between proton and proton, between neutron and neutron, and between neutron and proton, is all exactly the same—there is a symmetry for nuclear forces, a new one, that we can interchange neutron and proton—but it evidently is not a general symmetry, for the electrical repulsion between two protons at a distance does not exist for neutrons."
9601,"So it is not generally true that we can always replace a proton with a neutron, but only to a good approximation."
9602,Why good?
9603,Because the nuclear forces are much stronger than the electrical forces.
9604,So this is an “almost” symmetry also.
9605,So we do have examples in other things.
9606,"We have, in our minds, a tendency to accept symmetry as some kind of perfection."
9607,"In fact it is like the old idea of the Greeks that circles were perfect, and it was rather horrible to believe that the planetary orbits were not circles, but only nearly circles."
9608,"The difference between being a circle and being nearly a circle is not a small difference, it is a fundamental change so far as the mind is concerned."
9609,There is a sign of perfection and symmetry in a circle that is not there the moment the circle is slightly off—that is the end of it—it is no longer symmetrical.
9610,Then the question is why it is only nearly a circle—that is a much more difficult question.
9611,"The actual motion of the planets, in general, should be ellipses, but during the ages, because of tidal forces, and so on, they have been made almost symmetrical."
9612,Now the question is whether we have a similar problem here.
9613,"The problem from the point of view of the circles is if they were perfect circles there would be nothing to explain, that is clearly simple."
9614,"But since they are only nearly circles, there is a lot to explain, and the result turned out to be a big dynamical problem, and now our problem is to explain why they are nearly symmetrical by looking at tidal forces and so on."
9615,So our problem is to explain where symmetry comes from.
9616,Why is nature so nearly symmetrical?
9617,No one has any idea why.
9618,"The only thing we might suggest is something like this: There is a gate in Japan, a gate in Neiko, which is sometimes called by the Japanese the most beautiful gate in all Japan; it was built in a time when there was great influence from Chinese art."
9619,"This gate is very elaborate, with lots of gables and beautiful carving and lots of columns and dragon heads and princes carved into the pillars, and so on."
9620,"But when one looks closely he sees that in the elaborate and complex design along one of the pillars, one of the small design elements is carved upside down; otherwise the thing is completely symmetrical."
9621,"If one asks why this is, the story is that it was carved upside down so that the gods will not be jealous of the perfection of man."
9622,"So they purposely put an error in there, so that the gods would not be jealous and get angry with human beings."
9623,We might like to turn the idea around and think that the true explanation of the near symmetry of nature is this: that God made the laws only nearly symmetrical so that we should not be jealous of His perfection!
9624,"Consider a force like gravitation which varies predominantly inversely as the square of the distance, but which is about a billion-billion-billion-billion times stronger."
9625,And with another difference.
9626,"There are two kinds of “matter,” which we can call positive and negative."
9627,Like kinds repel and unlike kinds attract—unlike gravity where there is only attraction.
9628,What would happen?
9629,A bunch of positives would repel with an enormous force and spread out in all directions.
9630,A bunch of negatives would do the same.
9631,But an evenly mixed bunch of positives and negatives would do something completely different.
9632,The opposite pieces would be pulled together by the enormous attractions.
9633,"The net result would be that the terrific forces would balance themselves out almost perfectly, by forming tight, fine mixtures of the positive and the negative, and between two separate bunches of such mixtures there would be practically no attraction or repulsion at all."
9634,There is such a force: the electrical force.
9635,And all matter is a mixture of positive protons and negative electrons which are attracting and repelling with this great force.
9636,"So perfect is the balance, however, that when you stand near someone else you don’t feel any force at all."
9637,If there were even a little bit of unbalance you would know it.
9638,"If you were standing at arm’s length from someone and each of you had one percent more electrons than protons, the repelling force would be incredible."
9639,How great?
9640,Enough to lift the Empire State Building?
9641,No!
9642,To lift Mount Everest?
9643,No!
9644,The repulsion would be enough to lift a “weight” equal to that of the entire earth!
9645,"With such enormous forces so perfectly balanced in this intimate mixture, it is not hard to understand that matter, trying to keep its positive and negative charges in the finest balance, can have a great stiffness and strength."
9646,"The Empire State Building, for example, swings less than one inch in the wind because the electrical forces hold every electron and proton more or less in its proper place."
9647,"On the other hand, if we look at matter on a scale small enough that we see only a few atoms, any small piece will not, usually, have an equal number of positive and negative charges, and so there will be strong residual electrical forces."
9648,"Even when there are equal numbers of both charges in two neighboring small pieces, there may still be large net electrical forces because the forces between individual charges vary inversely as the square of the distance."
9649,A net force can arise if a negative charge of one piece is closer to the positive than to the negative charges of the other piece.
9650,The attractive forces can then be larger than the repulsive ones and there can be a net attraction between two small pieces with no excess charges.
9651,"The force that holds the atoms together, and the chemical forces that hold molecules together, are really electrical forces acting in regions where the balance of charge is not perfect, or where the distances are very small."
9652,"You know, of course, that atoms are made with positive protons in the nucleus and with electrons outside."
9653,"You may ask: “If this electrical force is so terrific, why don’t the protons and electrons just get on top of each other?"
9654,"If they want to be in an intimate mixture, why isn’t it still more intimate?” The answer has to do with the quantum effects."
9655,"If we try to confine our electrons in a region that is very close to the protons, then according to the uncertainty principle they must have some mean square momentum which is larger the more we try to confine them."
9656,"It is this motion, required by the laws of quantum mechanics, that keeps the electrical attraction from bringing the charges any closer together."
9657,There is another question: “What holds the nucleus together”?
9658,"In a nucleus there are several protons, all of which are positive."
9659,Why don’t they push themselves apart?
9660,"It turns out that in nuclei there are, in addition to electrical forces, nonelectrical forces, called nuclear forces, which are greater than the electrical forces and which are able to hold the protons together in spite of the electrical repulsion."
9661,And this has an important consequence.
9662,"If a nucleus has too many protons in it, it gets too big, and it will not stay together."
9663,"An example is uranium, with 92 protons."
9664,"The nuclear forces act mainly between each proton (or neutron) and its nearest neighbor, while the electrical forces act over larger distances, giving a repulsion between each proton and all of the others in the nucleus."
9665,"The more protons in a nucleus, the stronger is the electrical repulsion, until, as in the case of uranium, the balance is so delicate that the nucleus is almost ready to fly apart from the repulsive electrical force."
9666,"If such a nucleus is just “tapped” lightly (as can be done by sending in a slow neutron), it breaks into two pieces, each with positive charge, and these pieces fly apart by electrical repulsion."
9667,The energy which is liberated is the energy of the atomic bomb.
9668,"This energy is usually called “nuclear” energy, but it is really “electrical” energy released when electrical forces have overcome the attractive nuclear forces."
9669,"We may ask, finally, what holds a negatively charged electron together (since it has no nuclear forces)."
9670,"If an electron is all made of one kind of substance, each part should repel the other parts."
9671,"Why, then, doesn’t it fly apart?"
9672,But does the electron have “parts”?
9673,"Perhaps we should say that the electron is just a point and that electrical forces only act between different point charges, so that the electron does not act upon itself."
9674,Perhaps.
9675,All we can say is that the question of what holds the electron together has produced many difficulties in the attempts to form a complete theory of electromagnetism.
9676,The question has never been answered.
9677,We will entertain ourselves by discussing this subject some more in later chapters.
9678,"As we have seen, we should expect that it is a combination of electrical forces and quantum-mechanical effects that will determine the detailed structure of materials in bulk, and, therefore, their properties."
9679,"Some materials are hard, some are soft."
9680,Some are electrical “conductors”—because their electrons are free to move about; others are “insulators”—because their electrons are held tightly to individual atoms.
9681,"We shall consider later how some of these properties come about, but that is a very complicated subject, so we will begin by looking at the electrical forces only in simple situations."
9682,"We begin by treating only the laws of electricity—including magnetism, which is really a part of the same subject."
9683,"We have said that the electrical force, like a gravitational force, decreases inversely as the square of the distance between charges."
9684,This relationship is called Coulomb’s law.
9685,But it is not precisely true when charges are moving—the electrical forces depend also on the motions of the charges in a complicated way.
9686,One part of the force between moving charges we call the magnetic force.
9687,It is really one aspect of an electrical effect.
9688,That is why we call the subject “electromagnetism.”
9689,There is an important general principle that makes it possible to treat electromagnetic forces in a relatively simple way.
9690,"We find, from experiment, that the force that acts on a particular charge—no matter how many other charges there are or how they are moving—depends only on the position of that particular charge, on the velocity of the charge, and on the amount of charge."
9691,The important thing is that the electrical forces from all the other charges in the universe can be summarized by giving just these two vectors.
9692,"Their values will depend on where the charge is, and may change with time."
9693,"Furthermore, if we replace that charge with another charge, the force on the new charge will be just in proportion to the amount of charge so long as all the rest of the charges in the world do not change their positions or motions."
9694,"(In real situations, of course, each charge produces forces on all other charges in the neighborhood and may cause these other charges to move, and so in some cases the fields can change if we replace our particular charge by another.)"
9695,We know from Vol.
9696,I how to find the motion of a particle if we know the force on it.
9697,It holds also for magnetic fields.
9698,"This principle means that if we know the law for the electric and magnetic fields produced by a single charge moving in an arbitrary way, then all the laws of electrodynamics are complete."
9699,"If it had only turned out that the field produced by a single charge was simple, this would be the neatest way to describe the laws of electrodynamics."
9700,"We have already given a description of this law (Chapter 28, Vol."
9701,"I) and it is, unfortunately, rather complicated."
9702,It turns out that the forms in which the laws of electrodynamics are simplest are not what you might expect.
9703,It is not simplest to give a formula for the force that one charge produces on another.
9704,"It is true that when charges are standing still the Coulomb force law is simple, but when charges are moving about the relations are complicated by delays in time and by the effects of acceleration, among others."
9705,"As a result, we do not wish to present electrodynamics only through the force laws between charges; we find it more convenient to consider another point of view—a point of view in which the laws of electrodynamics appear to be the most easily manageable."
9706,We have defined them in terms of the forces that are felt by a charge.
9707,We wish now to speak of electric and magnetic fields at a point even when there is no charge present.
9708,"We are saying, in effect, that since there are forces “acting on” the charge, there is still “something” there when the charge is removed."
9709,Another example is the “velocity field” of a flowing liquid.
9710,It is a vector field.
9711,"Returning to the electromagnetic fields—although they are produced by charges according to complicated formulas, they have the following important characteristic: the relationships between the values of the fields at one point and the values at a nearby point are very simple."
9712,With only a few such relationships in the form of differential equations we can describe the fields completely.
9713,It is in terms of such equations that the laws of electrodynamics are most simply written.
9714,There have been various inventions to help the mind visualize the behavior of fields.
9715,The most correct is also the most abstract: we simply consider the fields as mathematical functions of position and time.
9716,"We can also attempt to get a mental picture of the field by drawing vectors at many points in space, each of which gives the field strength and direction at that point."
9717,Such a representation is shown in Fig.
9718,1–1.
9719,"We can go further, however, and draw lines which are everywhere tangent to the vectors—which, so to speak, follow the arrows and keep track of the direction of the field."
9720,"When we do this we lose track of the lengths of the vectors, but we can keep track of the strength of the field by drawing the lines far apart when the field is weak and close together when it is strong."
9721,We adopt the convention that the number of lines per unit area at right angles to the lines is proportional to the field strength.
9722,"This is, of course, only an approximation, and it will require, in general, that new lines sometimes start up in order to keep the number up to the strength of the field."
9723,The field of Fig.
9724,1–1 is represented by field lines in Fig.
9725,1–2.
9726,There are two mathematically important properties of a vector field which we will use in our description of the laws of electricity from the field point of view.
9727,"Suppose we imagine a closed surface of some kind and ask whether we are losing “something” from the inside; that is, does the field have a quality of “outflow”?"
9728,"For instance, for a velocity field we might ask whether the velocity is always outward on the surface or, more generally, whether more fluid flows out (per unit time) than comes in."
9729,We call the net amount of fluid going out through the surface per unit time the “flux of velocity” through the surface.
9730,The flow through an element of a surface is just equal to the component of the velocity perpendicular to the surface times the area of the surface.
9731,"In the case of an electric field, we can mathematically define something analogous to an outflow, and we again call it the flux, but of course it is not the flow of any substance, because the electric field is not the velocity of anything."
9732,"It turns out, however, that the mathematical quantity which is the average normal component of the field still has a useful significance."
9733,"We speak, then, of the electric flux—also defined by Eq."
9734,(1.4).
9735,"Finally, it is also useful to speak of the flux not only through a completely closed surface, but through any bounded surface."
9736,"As before, the flux through such a surface is defined as the average normal component of a vector times the area of the surface."
9737,These ideas are illustrated in Fig.
9738,1–3.
9739,"There is a second property of a vector field that has to do with a line, rather than a surface."
9740,Suppose again that we think of a velocity field that describes the flow of a liquid.
9741,We might ask this interesting question: Is the liquid circulating?
9742,By that we mean: Is there a net rotational motion around some loop?
9743,"Suppose that we instantaneously freeze the liquid everywhere except inside of a tube which is of uniform bore, and which goes in a loop that closes back on itself as in Fig."
9744,1–4.
9745,"Outside of the tube the liquid stops moving, but inside the tube it may keep on moving because of the momentum in the trapped liquid—that is, if there is more momentum heading one way around the tube than the other."
9746,We define a quantity called the circulation as the resulting speed of the liquid in the tube times its circumference.
9747,We can again extend our ideas and define the “circulation” for any vector field (even when there isn’t anything moving).
9748,For any vector field the circulation around any imagined closed curve is defined as the average tangential component of the vector (in a consistent sense) multiplied by the circumference of the loop (Fig.
9749,With just these two ideas—flux and circulation—we can describe all the laws of electricity and magnetism at once.
9750,"You may not understand the significance of the laws right away, but they will give you some idea of the way the physics of electromagnetism will be ultimately described."
9751,"To show the power of this type of statement, we can show that Eq."
9752,"(1.6) is the same as Coulomb’s law, provided only that we also add the idea that the field from a single charge is spherically symmetric."
9753,"For a point charge, we draw a sphere around the charge."
9754,"Our rule now says that the field at the surface of the sphere, times the area of the sphere—that is, the outgoing flux—is proportional to the charge inside."
9755,"If we were to make the radius of the sphere bigger, the area would increase as the square of the radius."
9756,"The average normal component of the electric field times that area must still be equal to the same charge inside, and so the field must decrease as the square of the distance—we get an “inverse square” field."
9757,"If we have an arbitrary stationary curve in space and measure the circulation of the electric field around the curve, we will find that it is not, in general, zero (although it is for the Coulomb field)."
9758,(1.9) is the square of the velocity of light.
9759,It appears because magnetism is in reality a relativistic effect of electricity.
9760,"Equations (1.6) through (1.9), together with Eq."
9761,"(1.1), are all the laws of electrodynamics1."
9762,"As you remember, the laws of Newton were very simple to write down, but they had a lot of complicated consequences and it took us a long time to learn about them all."
9763,"These laws are not nearly as simple to write down, which means that the consequences are going to be more elaborate and it will take us quite a lot of time to figure them all out."
9764,We can illustrate some of the laws of electrodynamics by a series of small experiments which show qualitatively the interrelationships of electric and magnetic fields.
9765,You have experienced the first term of Eq.
9766,"(1.1) when combing your hair, so we won’t show that one."
9767,The second part of Eq.
9768,"(1.1) can be demonstrated by passing a current through a wire which hangs above a bar magnet, as shown in Fig."
9769,1–6.
9770,"When the wire is pushed to the left, we would expect that the magnet must feel a push to the right."
9771,(Otherwise we could put the whole thing on a wagon and have a propulsion system that didn’t conserve momentum!)
9772,"Although the force is too small to make movement of the bar magnet visible, a more sensitively supported magnet, like a compass needle, will show the movement."
9773,How does the wire push on the magnet?
9774,The current in the wire produces a magnetic field of its own that exerts forces on the magnet.
9775,According to the last term in Eq.
9776,1–7.
9777,"Now, we have said that a current through a wire produces a magnetic field, and that when there is a magnetic field present there is a force on a wire carrying a current."
9778,"Then we should also expect that if we make a magnetic field with a current in one wire, it should exert a force on another wire which also carries a current."
9779,This can be shown by using two hanging wires as shown in Fig.
9780,1–8.
9781,"When the currents are in the same direction, the two wires attract, but when the currents are opposite, they repel."
9782,"In short, electrical currents, as well as magnets, make magnetic fields."
9783,"But wait, what is a magnet, anyway?"
9784,"If magnetic fields are produced by moving charges, is it not possible that the magnetic field from a piece of iron is really the result of currents?"
9785,It appears to be so.
9786,"We can replace the bar magnet of our experiment with a coil of wire, as shown in Fig."
9787,1–9.
9788,"When a current is passed through the coil—as well as through the straight wire above it—we observe a motion of the wire exactly as before, when we had a magnet instead of a coil."
9789,"In other words, the current in the coil imitates a magnet."
9790,"It appears, then, that a piece of iron acts as though it contains a perpetual circulating current."
9791,"We can, in fact, understand magnets in terms of permanent currents in the atoms of the iron."
9792,The force on the magnet in Fig.
9793,1–7 is due to the second term in Eq.
9794,(1.1).
9795,Where do the currents come from?
9796,One possibility would be from the motion of the electrons in atomic orbits.
9797,"Actually, that is not the case for iron, although it is for some materials."
9798,"In addition to moving around in an atom, an electron also spins about on its own axis—something like the spin of the earth—and it is the current from this spin that gives the magnetic field in iron."
9799,(We say “something like the spin of the earth” because the question is so deep in quantum mechanics that the classical ideas do not really describe things too well.)
9800,"In most substances, some electrons spin one way and some spin the other, so the magnetism cancels out, but in iron—for a mysterious reason which we will discuss later—many of the electrons are spinning with their axes lined up, and that is the source of the magnetism."
9801,"Since the fields of magnets are from currents, we do not have to add any extra term to Eqs."
9802,(1.8) or (1.9) to take care of magnets.
9803,"We just take all currents, including the circulating currents of the spinning electrons, and then the law is right."
9804,You should also notice that Eq.
9805,(1.8) says that there are no magnetic “charges” analogous to the electrical charges appearing on the right side of Eq.
9806,(1.6).
9807,None has been found.
9808,The first term on the right-hand side of Eq.
9809,(1.9) was discovered theoretically by Maxwell and is of great importance.
9810,It says that changing electric fields produce magnetic effects.
9811,"In fact, without this term the equation would not make sense, because without it there could be no currents in circuits that are not complete loops."
9812,"But such currents do exist, as we can see in the following example."
9813,Imagine a capacitor made of two flat plates.
9814,"It is being charged by a current that flows toward one plate and away from the other, as shown in Fig."
9815,1–10.
9816,According to Eq.
9817,There is certainly no current through this surface.
9818,"But, surely, just changing the location of an imaginary surface is not going to change a real magnetic field!"
9819,The first term on the right-hand side of Eq.
9820,(1.9) to be correct.
9821,"Maxwell saw that it was needed, and he was the first to write the complete equation."
9822,With the setup shown in Fig.
9823,1–6 we can demonstrate another of the laws of electromagnetism.
9824,We disconnect the ends of the hanging wire from the battery and connect them to a galvanometer which tells us when there is a current through the wire.
9825,"When we push the wire sideways through the magnetic field of the magnet, we observe a current."
9826,Such an effect is again just another consequence of Eq.
9827,The electrons have a sidewise velocity because they move with the wire.
9828,"Suppose, however, that we leave the wire alone and move the magnet."
9829,"We guess from relativity that it should make no difference, and indeed, we observe a similar current in the galvanometer."
9830,How does the magnetic field produce forces on charges at rest?
9831,According to Eq.
9832,(1.1) there must be an electric field.
9833,A moving magnet must make an electric field.
9834,How that happens is said quantitatively by Eq.
9835,(1.7).
9836,"This equation describes many phenomena of great practical interest, such as those that occur in electric generators and transformers."
9837,The most remarkable consequence of our equations is that the combination of Eq.
9838,(1.7) and Eq.
9839,(1.9) contains the explanation of the radiation of electromagnetic effects over large distances.
9840,"The reason is roughly something like this: suppose that somewhere we have a magnetic field which is increasing because, say, a current is turned on suddenly in a wire."
9841,Then by Eq.
9842,(1.7) there must be a circulation of an electric field.
9843,"As the electric field builds up to produce its circulation, then according to Eq."
9844,(1.9) a magnetic circulation will be generated.
9845,"But the building up of this magnetic field will produce a new circulation of the electric field, and so on."
9846,In this way fields work their way through space without the need of charges or currents except at their source.
9847,That is the way we see each other!
9848,It is all in the equations of the electromagnetic fields.
9849,We now make a few remarks on our way of looking at this subject.
9850,You may be saying: “All this business of fluxes and circulations is pretty abstract.
9851,There are electric fields at every point in space; then there are these ‘laws.’ But what is actually happening?
9852,"Why can’t you explain it, for instance, by whatever it is that goes between the charges.” Well, it depends on your prejudices."
9853,Many physicists used to say that direct action with nothing in between was inconceivable.
9854,(How could they find an idea inconceivable when it had already been conceived?)
9855,"They would say: “Look, the only forces we know are the direct action of one piece of matter on another."
9856,It is impossible that there can be a force with nothing to transmit it.” But what really happens when we study the “direct action” of one piece of matter right against another?
9857,"We discover that it is not one piece right against the other; they are slightly separated, and there are electrical forces acting on a tiny scale."
9858,Thus we find that we are going to explain so-called direct-contact action in terms of the picture for electrical forces.
9859,"It is certainly not sensible to try to insist that an electrical force has to look like the old, familiar, muscular push or pull, when it will turn out that the muscular pushes and pulls are going to be interpreted as electrical forces!"
9860,The only sensible question is what is the most convenient way to look at electrical effects.
9861,"Some people prefer to represent them as the interaction at a distance of charges, and to use a complicated law."
9862,Others love the field lines.
9863,"The field lines, however, are only a crude way of describing a field, and it is very difficult to give the correct, quantitative laws directly in terms of field lines."
9864,"Also, the ideas of the field lines do not contain the deepest principle of electrodynamics, which is the superposition principle."
9865,"Even though we know how the field lines look for one set of charges and what the field lines look like for another set of charges, we don’t get any idea about what the field line patterns will look like when both sets are present together."
9866,"From the mathematical standpoint, on the other hand, superposition is easy—we simply add the two vectors."
9867,"The field lines have some advantage in giving a vivid picture, but they also have some disadvantages."
9868,"The direct interaction way of thinking has great advantages when thinking of electrical charges at rest, but has great disadvantages when dealing with charges in rapid motion."
9869,The best way is to use the abstract field idea.
9870,"That it is abstract is unfortunate, but necessary."
9871,"The attempts to try to represent the electric field as the motion of some kind of gear wheels, or in terms of lines, or of stresses in some kind of material have used up more effort of physicists than it would have taken simply to get the right answers about electrodynamics."
9872,It is interesting that the correct equations for the behavior of light were worked out by MacCullagh in 1839.
9873,"But people said to him: “Yes, but there is no real material whose mechanical properties could possibly satisfy those equations, and since light is an oscillation that must vibrate in something, we cannot believe this abstract equation business.” If people had been more open-minded, they might have believed in the right equations for the behavior of light a lot earlier than they did."
9874,In the case of the magnetic field we can make the following point: Suppose that you finally succeeded in making up a picture of the magnetic field in terms of some kind of lines or of gear wheels running through space.
9875,"Then you try to explain what happens to two charges moving in space, both at the same speed and parallel to each other."
9876,"Because they are moving, they will behave like two currents and will have a magnetic field associated with them (like the currents in the wires of Fig."
9877,1–8).
9878,"An observer who was riding along with the two charges, however, would see both charges as stationary, and would say that there is no magnetic field."
9879,The “gear wheels” or “lines” disappear when you ride along with the object!
9880,All we have done is to invent a new problem.
9881,How can the gear wheels disappear?!
9882,The people who draw field lines are in a similar difficulty.
9883,Not only is it not possible to say whether the field lines move or do not move with charges—they may disappear completely in certain coordinate frames.
9884,"What we are saying, then, is that magnetism is really a relativistic effect."
9885,These corrections must correspond to the magnetic force.
9886,But what about the force between the two wires in our experiment (Fig.
9887,1–8).
9888,There the magnetic force is the whole force.
9889,Surely a negligible “correction.” But no!
9890,It becomes the dominant term.
9891,"And that is why, when relativity was discovered, the electromagnetic laws didn’t need to be changed."
9892,"Let us end this chapter by pointing out that among the many phenomena studied by the Greeks there were two very strange ones: that if you rubbed a piece of amber you could lift up little pieces of papyrus, and that there was a strange rock from the land of Magnesia which attracted iron."
9893,It is amazing to think that these were the only phenomena known to the Greeks in which the effects of electricity or magnetism were apparent.
9894,The reason that these were the only phenomena that appeared is due primarily to the fantastic precision of the balancing of charges that we mentioned earlier.
9895,Study by scientists who came after the Greeks uncovered one new phenomenon after another that were really some aspect of these amber and/or lodestone effects.
9896,"Now we realize that the phenomena of chemical interaction and, ultimately, of life itself are to be understood in terms of electromagnetism."
9897,"At the same time that an understanding of the subject of electromagnetism was being developed, technical possibilities that defied the imagination of the people that came before were appearing: it became possible to signal by telegraph over long distances, and to talk to another person miles away without any connections between, and to run huge power systems—a great water wheel, connected by filaments over hundreds of miles to another engine that turns in response to the master wheel—many thousands of branching filaments—ten thousand engines in ten thousand places running the machines of industries and homes—all turning because of the knowledge of the laws of electromagnetism."
9898,Today we are applying even more subtle effects.
9899,"The electrical forces, enormous as they are, can also be very tiny, and we can control them and use them in very many ways."
9900,So delicate are our instruments that we can tell what a man is doing by the way he affects the electrons in a thin metal rod hundreds of miles away.
9901,All we need to do is to use the rod as an antenna for a television receiver!
9902,"From a long view of the history of mankind—seen from, say, ten thousand years from now—there can be little doubt that the most significant event of the 19th century will be judged as Maxwell’s discovery of the laws of electrodynamics."
9903,The American Civil War will pale into provincial insignificance in comparison with this important scientific event of the same decade.
9904,The physicist needs a facility in looking at problems from several points of view.
9905,"The exact analysis of real physical problems is usually quite complicated, and any particular physical situation may be too complicated to analyze directly by solving the differential equation."
9906,But one can still get a very good idea of the behavior of a system if one has some feel for the character of the solution in different circumstances.
9907,"Ideas such as the field lines, capacitance, resistance, and inductance are, for such purposes, very useful."
9908,So we will spend much of our time analyzing them.
9909,In this way we will get a feel as to what should happen in different electromagnetic situations.
9910,"On the other hand, none of the heuristic models, such as field lines, is really adequate and accurate for all situations."
9911,"There is only one precise way of presenting the laws, and that is by means of differential equations."
9912,"They have the advantage of being fundamental and, so far as we know, precise."
9913,If you have learned the differential equations you can always go back to them.
9914,There is nothing to unlearn.
9915,It will take you some time to understand what should happen in different circumstances.
9916,You will have to solve the equations.
9917,"Each time you solve the equations, you will learn something about the character of the solutions."
9918,"To keep these solutions in mind, it will be useful also to study their meaning in terms of field lines and of other concepts."
9919,This is the way you will really “understand” the equations.
9920,That is the difference between mathematics and physics.
9921,"Mathematicians, or people who have very mathematical minds, are often led astray when “studying” physics because they lose sight of the physics."
9922,"They say: “Look, these differential equations—the Maxwell equations—are all there is to electrodynamics; it is admitted by the physicists that there is nothing which is not contained in the equations."
9923,"The equations are complicated, but after all they are only mathematical equations and if I understand them mathematically inside out, I will understand the physics inside out.” Only it doesn’t work that way."
9924,"Mathematicians who study physics with that point of view—and there have been many of them—usually make little contribution to physics and, in fact, little to mathematics."
9925,They fail because the actual physical situations in the real world are so complicated that it is necessary to have a much broader understanding of the equations.
9926,"What it means really to understand an equation—that is, in more than a strictly mathematical sense—was described by Dirac."
9927,"He said: “I understand what an equation means if I have a way of figuring out the characteristics of its solution without actually solving it.” So if we have a way of knowing what should happen in given circumstances without actually solving the equations, then we “understand” the equations, as applied to these circumstances."
9928,"A physical understanding is a completely unmathematical, imprecise, and inexact thing, but absolutely necessary for a physicist."
9929,"Ordinarily, a course like this is given by developing gradually the physical ideas—by starting with simple situations and going on to more and more complicated situations."
9930,"This requires that you continuously forget things you previously learned—things that are true in certain situations, but which are not true in general."
9931,"For example, the “law” that the electrical force depends on the square of the distance is not always true."
9932,We prefer the opposite approach.
9933,"We prefer to take first the complete laws, and then to step back and apply them to simple situations, developing the physical ideas as we go along."
9934,And that is what we are going to do.
9935,Our approach is completely opposite to the historical approach in which one develops the subject in terms of the experiments by which the information was obtained.
9936,"But the subject of physics has been developed over the past 200 years by some very ingenious people, and as we have only a limited time to acquire our knowledge, we cannot possibly cover everything they did."
9937,"Unfortunately one of the things that we shall have a tendency to lose in these lectures is the historical, experimental development."
9938,It is hoped that in the laboratory some of this lack can be corrected.
9939,"You can also fill in what we must leave out by reading the Encyclopedia Britannica, which has excellent historical articles on electricity and on other parts of physics."
9940,You will also find historical information in many textbooks on electricity and magnetism.
9941,"We begin now with the abstract, mathematical view of the theory of electricity and magnetism."
9942,The ultimate idea is to explain the meaning of the laws given in Chapter 1.
9943,But to do this we must first explain a new and peculiar notation that we want to use.
9944,So let us forget electromagnetism for the moment and discuss the mathematics of vector fields.
9945,"It is of very great importance, not only for electromagnetism, but for all kinds of physical circumstances."
9946,"Just as ordinary differential and integral calculus is so important to all branches of physics, so also is the differential calculus of vectors."
9947,We turn to that subject.
9948,Listed below are a few facts from the algebra of vectors.
9949,It is assumed that you already know them.
9950,The simplest possible physical field is a scalar field.
9951,"By a field, you remember, we mean a quantity which depends upon position in space."
9952,By a scalar field we merely mean a field which is characterized at each point by a single number—a scalar.
9953,"Of course the number may change in time, but we need not worry about that for the moment."
9954,We will talk about what the field looks like at a given instant.
9955,"As an example of a scalar field, consider a solid block of material which has been heated at some places and cooled at others, so that the temperature of the body varies from point to point in a complicated way."
9956,Temperature is a scalar field.
9957,"One way of thinking about scalar fields is to imagine “contours” which are imaginary surfaces drawn through all points for which the field has the same value, just as contour lines on a map connect points with the same height."
9958,For a temperature field the contours are called “isothermal surfaces” or isotherms.
9959,Several isotherms are drawn.
9960,There are also vector fields.
9961,The idea is very simple.
9962,A vector is given for each point in space.
9963,The vector varies from point to point.
9964,"As an example, consider a rotating body."
9965,The velocity of the material of the body at any point is a vector which is a function of position (Fig.
9966,2–2).
9967,"As a second example, consider the flow of heat in a block of material."
9968,"If the temperature in the block is high at one place and low at another, there will be a flow of heat from the hotter places to the colder."
9969,The heat will be flowing in different directions in different parts of the block.
9970,Its magnitude is a measure of how much heat is flowing.
9971,Examples of the heat flow vector are also shown in Fig.
9972,2–1.
9973,The vector points in the direction of flow (see Fig.
9974,2–3).
9975,We ask how much heat flows through a small surface at any angle with respect to the flow.
9976,In Fig.
9977,We will be applying the same ideas to other vector fields.
9978,"We want to describe the variations with position in a similar way, because we are interested in the relationship between, say, the temperature in one place and the temperature at a nearby place."
9979,How shall we take the derivative of the temperature with respect to position?
9980,Useful physical laws do not depend upon the orientation of the coordinate system.
9981,"They should, therefore, be written in a form in which either both sides are scalars or both sides are vectors."
9982,"Is it a scalar, or a vector, or what?"
9983,Of course it is not generally true that any three numbers form a vector.
9984,"It is true only if, when we rotate the coordinate system, the components of the vector transform among themselves in the correct way."
9985,So it is necessary to analyze how these derivatives are changed by a rotation of the coordinate system.
9986,We shall show that (2.11) is indeed a vector.
9987,The derivatives do transform in the correct way when the coordinate system is rotated.
9988,We can see this in several ways.
9989,"One way is to ask a question whose answer is independent of the coordinate system, and try to express the answer in an “invariant” form."
9990,"It can’t, because it’s a dot product of two vectors."
9991,Now let’s think of the temperature field.
9992,"The temperatures at these real, physical points certainly do not depend on what axis we choose for measuring the coordinates."
9993,It is a scalar.
9994,2–5).
9995,Remembering Eq.
9996,(2.13) is a scalar.
9997,"Using this notation, we can rewrite Eq."
9998,The form of Eq.
9999,Perhaps you are still not convinced?
10000,Let’s prove it in a different way.
10001,"(Although if you look carefully, you may be able to see that it’s really the same proof in a longer-winded form!)"
10002,I.
10003,(You can check out the more general case for yourself.)
10004,2–6(a).
10005,2–6(b).
10006,What would a computation in the prime system give?
10007,Substituting these in Eq.
10008,(2.18).
10009,Now we can do something that is extremely amusing and ingenious—and characteristic of the things that make mathematics beautiful.
10010,"Since the differential operators themselves transform as the components of a vector should, we can call them components of a vector operator."
10011,"Alone, it means nothing."
10012,(One can always multiply a vector by a scalar.)
10013,It still does not mean anything.
10014,"With operators we must always keep the sequence right, so that the operations make proper sense."
10015,The order is important.
10016,It is indeed a physical vector having a meaning.
10017,(2.15)).
10018,Let us try combining it with a vector.
10019,We can combine two vectors by making a dot product.
10020,What it might ultimately mean would depend on what it is made to operate on.
10021,The second product is some scalar field.
10022,"(2.33), even though it looks different."
10023,It has been given the name the divergence.
10024,"We shall, however, postpone that until later."
10025,What about a cross product?
10026,They are called Maxwell’s equations.
10027,These four equations contain the complete classical theory of the electromagnetic field.
10028,You see what an elegantly simple form we can get with our new notation!
10029,Let us give another example of a law of physics written in vector notation.
10030,"The law is not a precise one, but for many metals and a number of other substances that conduct heat it is quite accurate."
10031,2–7(a)].
10032,"(For a given temperature difference, the thinner the slab the greater the heat flow.)"
10033,What will happen in a more complicated case?
10034,Say in an odd-shaped block of material in which the temperature varies in peculiar ways?
10035,Suppose we look at a tiny piece of the block and imagine a slab like that of Fig.
10036,2–7(a) on a miniature scale.
10037,"We orient the faces parallel to the isothermal surfaces, as in Fig."
10038,"2–7(b), so that Eq."
10039,(2.42) is correct for the small slab.
10040,2–7(b).
10041,Equation (2.44) is the differential equation of heat conduction in bulk materials.
10042,You see that it is a proper vector equation.
10043,It is the generalization to arbitrary cases of the special relation (2.42) for rectangular slabs.
10044,Later we should learn to write all sorts of elementary physics relations like (2.42) in the more sophisticated vector notation.
10045,This notation is useful not only because it makes the equations look simpler.
10046,It also shows most clearly the physical content of the equations without reference to any arbitrarily chosen coordinate system.
10047,So far we have had only first derivatives.
10048,Why not second derivatives?
10049,"Let’s look first at the second one, (b)."
10050,(2.8)).
10051,It goes the same for the other components.
10052,Now let us take another example.
10053,Let us see whether we can find another zero.
10054,Now we are going to state two mathematical theorems that we will not prove.
10055,They are very interesting and useful theorems for physicists to know.
10056,Now we have seen (Eq.
10057,"(2.46)) that the curl of a gradient is zero, which is easy to remember because of the way the vectors work."
10058,We have seen in Eq.
10059,(2.49) that the divergence of a curl of something is always zero.
10060,Now we look at the ones that are not zero.
10061,"It is not, in general, zero."
10062,It is a scalar field.
10063,It is a scalar operator.
10064,"Because it appears often in physics, it has been given a special name—the Laplacian."
10065,Something is wrong.
10066,"The first two terms are vectors all right (the operators are satisfied), but the last term doesn’t come out to anything."
10067,It’s still an operator.
10068,The trouble is that we haven’t been careful enough about keeping the order of our terms straight.
10069,If you look again at Eq.
10070,Now let’s make our substitution in (2.56).
10071,"It is, in fact, correct, as you can verify by computing the components."
10072,"It is a possible vector field, but there is nothing special to say about it."
10073,It’s just some vector field which may occasionally come up.
10074,Do you see why?
10075,"We have to be careful, though, because it is possible to go astray."
10076,"There are two pitfalls which we will mention, although they will not come up in this course."
10077,"Pitfall number two (which, again, we need not get into in our course) is the following: The rules that we have outlined here are simple and nice when we use rectangular coordinates."
10078,"The reason is that when we are dealing with the algebra of vectors, the directions of the vectors are all quite definite."
10079,"But when we are dealing with vector fields, their directions are different at different places."
10080,"If we try to describe a vector field in, say, polar coordinates, what we call the “radial” direction varies from point to point."
10081,So we can get into a lot of trouble when we start to differentiate the components.
10082,"For example, even for a constant vector field, the radial component changes from point to point."
10083,"But since it is a differential operator, we should use it only on vectors whose components are in a fixed direction—that means rectangular coordinates."
10084,We found in Chapter 2 that there were various ways of taking derivatives of fields.
10085,Some gave vector fields; some gave scalar fields.
10086,We would now like to get some understanding of the significance of the derivatives of fields.
10087,We will then have a better feeling for what a vector field equation means.
10088,Now we turn to the meanings of the divergence and curl operations.
10089,The interpretation of these quantities is best done in terms of certain vector integrals and equations relating such integrals.
10090,"These equations cannot, unfortunately, be obtained from vector algebra by some easy substitution, so you will just have to learn them as something new."
10091,"Of these integral formulas, one is practically trivial, but the other two are not."
10092,We will derive them and explain their implications.
10093,The equations we shall study are really mathematical theorems.
10094,"They will be useful not only for interpreting the meaning and the content of the divergence and the curl, but also in working out general physical theories."
10095,"These mathematical theorems are, for the theory of fields, what the theorem of the conservation of energy is to the mechanics of particles."
10096,General theorems like these are important for a deeper understanding of physics.
10097,"You will find, though, that they are not very useful for solving problems—except in the simplest cases."
10098,"It is delightful, however, that in the beginning of our subject there will be many simple problems which can be solved with the three integral formulas we are going to treat."
10099,"We will see, however, as the problems get harder, that we can no longer use these simple methods."
10100,We take up first an integral formula involving the gradient.
10101,"The relation contains a very simple idea: Since the gradient represents the rate of change of a field quantity, if we integrate that rate of change, we should get the total change."
10102,"3–1, the following relation is true: 
  Theorem 1."
10103,"First, we should review what we mean by a line integral."
10104,"We mark off the curve at a number of points and join these points by straight-line segments, as shown in Fig."
10105,3–2.
10106,"The integral in our theorem, Eq."
10107,"(3.1), means the same thing, although it looks a little different."
10108,(3.1) means the sum of such terms.
10109,Now let’s see why Eq.
10110,(3.1) is true.
10111,3–2.
10112,If we add Eqs.
10113,We have therefore proved Eq.
10114,(3.1).
10115,Before we consider our next integral theorem—a theorem about the divergence—we would like to study a certain idea which has an easily understood physical significance in the case of heat flow.
10116,3–3).
10117,We would like to find out how much heat is flowing out of this volume.
10118,The symbol stands for a two-dimensional differential.
10119,"We will use the simpler notation, and assume that you can remember that an area has two dimensions and a volume has three."
10120,3–3).
10121,"We would like to generalize this idea to the case where the vector does not represent the flow of anything; for instance, it might be the electric field."
10122,We can certainly still integrate the normal component of the electric field over an area if we wish.
10123,"We will also use the same definition even when the surface considered is not a closed one, as it is here."
10124,"Returning to the special case of heat flow, let us take a situation in which heat is conserved."
10125,"For example, imagine some material in which after an initial heating no further heat energy is generated or absorbed."
10126,"Then, if there is a net heat flow out of a closed surface, the heat content of the volume inside must decrease."
10127,This interpretation is possible because we are speaking of heat flow and also because we supposed that the heat was conserved.
10128,"We could not, of course, speak of the total heat inside the volume if heat were being generated there."
10129,Now we shall point out an interesting fact about the flux of any vector.
10130,"We now separate the volume into two parts by some kind of a “cut,” as in Fig."
10131,3–4.
10132,Now we have two closed surfaces and volumes.
10133,Does the sum equal the flux through the whole surface that we started with?
10134,The answer is yes.
10135,3–4.
10136,You see that the same arguments apply.
10137,"So for any way of dividing the original volume, it must be generally true that the flux through the outer surface, which is the original integral, is equal to a sum of the fluxes out of all the little interior pieces."
10138,We now take the special case of a small cube1 and find an interesting formula for the flux out of it.
10139,Consider a cube whose edges are lined up with the axes as in Fig.
10140,3–5.
10141,We shall do this by making a sum of the fluxes through each of the six faces.
10142,The total flux through all the faces is the sum of these terms.
10143,We now see the “meaning” of the divergence of a vector.
10144,For any finite volume we can use the fact we proved above—that the total flux from a volume is the sum of the fluxes out of each part.
10145,"We can, that is, integrate the divergence over the entire volume."
10146,This gives us the theorem that the integral of the normal component of any vector over any closed surface can also be written as the integral of the divergence of the vector over the volume enclosed by the surface.
10147,This theorem is named after Gauss.
10148,"Let’s consider an example of the use of this theorem, just to get familiar with it."
10149,"Suppose we take again the case of heat flow in, say, a metal."
10150,Suppose we have a simple situation in which all the heat has been previously put in and the body is just cooling off.
10151,"There are no sources of heat, so that heat is conserved."
10152,Then how much heat is there inside some chosen volume at any time?
10153,It must be decreasing by just the amount that flows out of the surface of the volume.
10154,"If our volume is a little cube, we would write, following Eq."
10155,Take careful note of the form of this equation; the form appears often in physics.
10156,It expresses a conservation law—here the conservation of heat.
10157,We have expressed the same physical fact in another way in Eq.
10158,(3.13).
10159,"Here we have the differential form of a conservation equation, while Eq."
10160,(3.13) is the integral form.
10161,We have obtained Eq.
10162,(3.21) by applying Eq.
10163,(3.13) to an infinitesimal cube.
10164,We can also go the other way.
10165,(3.13).
10166,Now let’s consider a different case.
10167,Imagine that we have a block of material and that inside it there is a very tiny hole in which some chemical reaction is taking place and generating heat.
10168,Or we could imagine that there are some wires running into a tiny resistor that is being heated by an electric current.
10169,"We shall suppose that in the rest of the volume heat is conserved, and that the heat generation has been going on for a long time—so that now the temperature is no longer changing anywhere."
10170,How much heat flow is there at each point?
10171,"All the heat that is being generated at the point source must flow out through the surface, since we have supposed that the flow is steady."
10172,"We can, however, find the field rather easily by taking a somewhat special surface."
10173,3–6).
10174,You see that we are adding a certain amount of guesswork—usually called “physical intuition”—to our mathematics in order to find the answer.
10175,The result we have just obtained applies to the heat flow in the vicinity of a point source of heat.
10176,"Let’s now try to find the equations that hold in the most general kind of heat flow, keeping only the condition that heat is conserved."
10177,We will be dealing only with what happens at places outside of any sources or absorbers of heat.
10178,The differential equation for the conduction of heat was derived in Chapter 2.
10179,According to Eq.
10180,"It is applicable, of course, only in regions of the material where there is no generation or absorption of heat."
10181,"We derived above another relation, Eq."
10182,"(3.21), that holds when heat is conserved."
10183,If we now make one more assumption we can obtain a very interesting equation.
10184,"We assume that the temperature of the material is proportional to the heat content per unit volume—that is, that the material has a definite specific heat."
10185,Using Eq.
10186,The differential equation (3.28) is called the heat diffusion equation.
10187,"The diffusion equation appears in many physical problems—in the diffusion of gases, in the diffusion of neutrons, and in others."
10188,We have already discussed the physics of some of these phenomena in Chapter 43 of Vol.
10189,I.
10190,Now you have the complete equation that describes diffusion in the most general possible situation.
10191,At some later time we will take up ways of solving the diffusion equation to find how the temperature varies in particular cases.
10192,We turn back now to consider other theorems about vector fields.
10193,We wish now to look at the curl in somewhat the same way we looked at the divergence.
10194,"We obtained Gauss’ theorem by considering the integral over a surface, although it was not obvious at the beginning that we were going to be dealing with the divergence."
10195,How did we know that we were supposed to integrate over a surface in order to get the divergence?
10196,It was not at all clear that this would be the result.
10197,"And so with an apparent equal lack of justification, we shall calculate something else about a vector and show that it is related to the curl."
10198,This time we calculate what is called the circulation of a vector field.
10199,The integral is called the circulation of the vector field around the loop.
10200,An example is given in Fig.
10201,3–7.
10202,The little circle on the integral sign is to remind us that the integral is to be taken all the way around.
10203,The name came originally from considering the circulation of a liquid.
10204,But the name—like flux—has been extended to apply to any field even when there is no material “circulating.”
10205,"Playing the same kind of game we did with the flux, we can show that the circulation around a loop is the sum of the circulations around two partial loops."
10206,Suppose we break up our curve of Fig.
10207,3–8.
10208,The circulation around the one part plus the circulation around the second part equals the circulation about the outer line.
10209,We can continue the process of cutting the original loop into any number of smaller loops.
10210,"When we add the circulations of the smaller loops, there is always a cancellation of the parts on their adjacent portions, so that the sum is equivalent to the circulation around the original single loop."
10211,Now let us suppose that the original loop is the boundary of some surface.
10212,"There are, of course, an infinite number of surfaces which all have the original loops as the boundary."
10213,"Our results will not, however, depend on which surface we choose."
10214,"First, we break our original loop into a number of small loops that all lie on the surface we have chosen, as in Fig."
10215,3–9.
10216,"No matter what the shape of the surface, if we choose our small loops small enough, we can assume that each of the small loops will enclose an area which is essentially flat."
10217,"Also, we can choose our small loops so that each is very nearly a square."
10218,How shall we find the circulation for each little square?
10219,"One question is, how is the square oriented in space?"
10220,We could easily make the calculation if it had a special orientation.
10221,"For example, if it were in one of the coordinate planes."
10222,3–10.
10223,"If our result is expressed in vector notation, we can say that it will be the same no matter what the particular orientation of the plane."
10224,"(The assumption is better the smaller the square, so we are really talking about infinitesimal squares.)"
10225,The minus signs are required because we want the tangential component in the direction of travel.
10226,Now let’s look at the first and third pieces.
10227,That is true to the first approximation.
10228,"3–11, and add the circulations around a set of infinitesimal squares in this surface."
10229,The sum can be written as an integral.
10230,Our result is a very useful theorem called Stokes’ theorem (after Mr. Stokes).
10231,We must now speak about a convention of signs.
10232,In Fig.
10233,"If we had gone around the other way, we would have gotten the opposite sign."
10234,"The “positive” normal must always be related to the sense of rotation, as in Fig."
10235,3–10.
10236,It is indicated for the general case in Fig.
10237,3–11.
10238,"We would like, now, to consider some consequences of our new theorems."
10239,Take first the case of a vector whose curl is everywhere zero.
10240,Then Stokes’ theorem says that the circulation around any loop is zero.
10241,The same logic was used in Chapter 14 of Vol.
10242,"I, where we proved that if the integral around a closed loop of some quantity is always zero, then that integral can be represented as the difference of a function of the position of the two ends."
10243,This fact allowed us to invent the idea of a potential.
10244,"We proved, furthermore, that the vector field was the gradient of this potential function (see Eq."
10245,(14.13) of Vol.
10246,I).
10247,It follows that any vector field whose curl is zero is equal to the gradient of some scalar function.
10248,"We can, if we wish, describe this special kind of vector field by means of a scalar field."
10249,Let’s show something else.
10250,"But if the integral is zero over any surface, the integrand must be zero."
10251,3–13.
10252,"We would like, in fact, to see what happens when the loop shrinks down to a point, so that the surface boundary disappears—the surface becomes closed."
10253,"Somehow, as we close the surface we add in contributions that cancel out what was there before."
10254,"Now this is interesting, because we already have a theorem about the surface integral of a vector field."
10255,"Such a surface integral is equal to the volume integral of the divergence of the vector, according to Gauss’ theorem (Eq."
10256,3.18).
10257,Since Eq.
10258,"(3.41) is true for any volume, it must be true that at every point in space the integrand is zero."
10259,Now we begin to see how everything fits together.
10260,Let us summarize what we have found about the vector calculus.
10261,These are really the salient points of Chapters 2 and 3:
10262,We begin now our detailed study of the theory of electromagnetism.
10263,All of electromagnetism is contained in the Maxwell equations.
10264,The situations that are described by these equations can be very complicated.
10265,"We will consider first relatively simple situations, and learn how to handle them before we take up more complicated ones."
10266,The easiest circumstance to treat is one in which nothing depends on the time—called the static case.
10267,"In these circumstances, all of the terms in the Maxwell equations which are time derivatives of the field are zero."
10268,You will notice an interesting thing about this set of four equations.
10269,It can be separated into two pairs.
10270,The two fields are not interconnected.
10271,This means that electricity and magnetism are distinct phenomena so long as charges and currents are static.
10272,Now if you look at the equations of statics you will see that the study of the two subjects we call electrostatics and magnetostatics is ideal from the point of view of learning about the mathematical properties of vector fields.
10273,Electrostatics is a neat example of a vector field with zero curl and a given divergence.
10274,Magnetostatics is a neat example of a field with zero divergence and a given curl.
10275,"The more conventional—and you may be thinking, more satisfactory—way of presenting the theory of electromagnetism is to start first with electrostatics and thus to learn about the divergence."
10276,Magnetostatics and the curl are taken up later.
10277,"Finally, electricity and magnetism are put together."
10278,We have chosen to start with the complete theory of vector calculus.
10279,We will begin with the simplest situations—ones in which the positions of all charges are specified.
10280,"If we had only to study electrostatics at this level (as we shall do in the next two chapters), life would be very simple—in fact, almost trivial."
10281,"Everything can be obtained from Coulomb’s law and some integration, as you will see."
10282,"In many real electrostatic problems, however, we do not know, initially, where the charges are."
10283,We know only that they have distributed themselves in ways that depend on the properties of matter.
10284,Then things can get quite complicated.
10285,"If, for instance, a charged body is brought near a conductor or insulator, the electrons and protons in the conductor or insulator will move around."
10286,"(4.5) may have one part that we know about, from the charge that we brought up; but there will be other parts from charges that have moved around in the conductor."
10287,And all of the charges must be taken into account.
10288,One can get into some rather subtle and interesting problems.
10289,"So although this chapter is to be on electrostatics, it will not cover the more beautiful and subtle parts of the subject."
10290,It will treat only the situation where we can assume that the positions of all the charges are known.
10291,"Naturally, you should be able to do that case before you try to handle the other ones."
10292,It would be logical to use Eqs.
10293,(4.5) and (4.6) as our starting points.
10294,"It will be easier, however, if we start somewhere else and come back to these equations."
10295,The results will be equivalent.
10296,"We will start with a law that we have talked about before, called Coulomb’s law, which says that between two charges at rest there is a force directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between."
10297,The force is along the straight line from one charge to the other.
10298,When there are more than two charges present—the only really interesting times—we must supplement Coulomb’s law with one other fact of nature: the force on any charge is the vector sum of the Coulomb forces from each of the other charges.
10299,This fact is called “the principle of superposition.” That’s all there is to electrostatics.
10300,"If we combine the Coulomb law and the principle of superposition, there is nothing else."
10301,Equations (4.5) and (4.6)—the electrostatic equations—say no more and no less.
10302,"When applying Coulomb’s law, it is convenient to introduce the idea of an electric field."
10303,Dividing Eq.
10304,(4.11) we really mean three equations—one for each component.
10305,Each term of the sum will look like (4.11) or (4.12).
10306,"Often it is convenient to ignore the fact that charges come in packages like electrons and protons, and think of them as being spread out in a continuous smear—or in a “distribution,” as it is called."
10307,This is O.K.
10308,so long as we are not interested in what is happening on too small a scale.
10309,"To use Coulomb’s law with such a description, we replace the sums of Eqs."
10310,(4.13) or (4.14) by integrals over all volumes containing charges.
10311,4-1.
10312,We are not going to use this formula much.
10313,We write it here only to emphasize the fact that we have completely solved all the electrostatic problems in which we know the locations of all of the charges.
10314,"Given the charges, what are the fields?"
10315,Answer: Do this integral.
10316,So there is nothing to the subject; it is just a case of doing complicated integrals over three dimensions—strictly a job for a computing machine!
10317,"With our integrals we can find the fields produced by a sheet of charge, from a line of charge, from a spherical shell of charge, or from any specified distribution."
10318,"It is important to realize, as we go on to draw field lines, to talk about potentials, or to calculate divergences, that we already have the answer here."
10319,It is merely a matter of it being sometimes easier to do an integral by some clever guesswork than by actually carrying it out.
10320,The guesswork requires learning all kinds of strange things.
10321,"In practice, it might be easier to forget trying to be clever and always to do the integral directly instead of being so smart."
10322,"We are, however, going to try to be smart about it."
10323,We shall go on to discuss some other features of the electric field.
10324,"First we take up the idea of electric potential, which is related to the work done in carrying a charge from one point to another."
10325,"There is some distribution of charge, which produces an electric field."
10326,We ask about how much work it would take to carry a small charge from one place to another.
10327,"The work done against the electrical forces in carrying a charge along some path is the negative of the component of the electrical force in the direction of the motion, integrated along the path."
10328,(See Fig.
10329,4-2.)
10330,It is more interesting for our purposes to consider the work that would be done in carrying one unit of charge.
10331,Then the force on the charge is numerically the same as the electric field.
10332,"There is nothing impossible, in principle, about getting energy out of a field."
10333,"We shall, in fact, encounter fields where it is possible."
10334,"It could be that as you move a charge you produce forces on the other part of the “machinery.” If the “machinery” moved against the force it would lose energy, thereby keeping the total energy in the world constant."
10335,"For electrostatics, however, there is no such “machinery.” We know what the forces back on the sources of the field are."
10336,They are the Coulomb forces on the charges responsible for the field.
10337,If the other charges are fixed in position—as we assume in electrostatics only—these back forces can do no work on them.
10338,"There is no way to get energy from them—provided, of course, that the principle of energy conservation works for electrostatic situations."
10339,"We believe that it will work, but let’s just show that it must follow from Coulomb’s law of force."
10340,Let’s start with the easiest possible path to calculate.
10341,"We carry our test charge first along the arc of a circle, then along a radius, as shown in part (a) of Fig."
10342,4-3.
10343,Now on that particular path it is child’s play to find the work done (otherwise we wouldn’t have picked it).
10344,"The field is radial (from Coulomb’s law), so it is at right angles to the direction of motion."
10345,Now let’s take another easy path.
10346,"For instance, the one shown in part (b) of Fig."
10347,4-3.
10348,"It goes for awhile along an arc of a circle, then radially for awhile, then along an arc again, then radially, and so on."
10349,"Every time we go along the circular parts, we do no work."
10350,We get the same answer for this path that we did for the first path we tried.
10351,It is clear that we would get the same answer for any path which is made up of an arbitrary number of the same kinds of pieces.
10352,What about smooth paths?
10353,Would we get the same answer?
10354,We discussed this point previously in Chapter 13 of Vol.
10355,I.
10356,"Since the work done depends only on the endpoints, it can be represented as the difference between two numbers."
10357,We can see this in the following way.
10358,4-4).
10359,We call this scalar function the electrostatic potential at any point.
10360,"For convenience, we will often take the reference point at infinity."
10361,"The electric field from several charges can be written as the sum of the electric field from the first, from the second, from the third, etc."
10362,When we integrate the sum to find the potential we get a sum of integrals.
10363,Each of the integrals is the negative of the potential from one of the charges.
10364,There is a superposition principle also for potentials.
10365,(4.22).
10366,Any problem with specified charges can be solved by computing the potential from (4.24) or (4.25) and using (4.27) to get the field.
10367,According to Eq.
10368,Yes.
10369,It is merely a practical matter.
10370,(4.6).
10371,"So far, everything is all right."
10372,We had shown that the work done around a closed path is zero.
10373,The electric field in electrostatics is an example of a curl-free field.
10374,(4.11).
10375,"If you get zero, the superposition principle says you would get zero for the field of any charge distribution."
10376,We should point out an important fact.
10377,"For any radial force the work done is independent of the path, and there exists a potential."
10378,"If you think about it, the entire argument we made above to show that the work integral was independent of the path depended only on the fact that the force from a single charge was radial and spherically symmetric."
10379,"Because of this, Eq."
10380,(4.28)—or (4.29)—can contain only part of the laws of electricity.
10381,We will now derive a field equation that depends specifically and directly on the fact that the force law is inverse square.
10382,"That the field varies inversely as the square of the distance seems, for some people, to be “only natural,” because “that’s the way things spread out.” Take a light source with light streaming out: the amount of light that passes through a surface cut out by a cone with its apex at the source is the same no matter at what radius the surface is placed."
10383,It must be so if there is to be conservation of light energy.
10384,"The amount of light per unit area—the intensity—must vary inversely as the area cut by the cone, i.e., inversely as the square of the distance from the source."
10385,Certainly the electric field should vary inversely as the square of the distance for the same reason!
10386,But there is no such thing as the “same reason” here.
10387,Nobody can say that the electric field measures the flow of something like light which must be conserved.
10388,"If we had a “model” of the electric field in which the electric field vector represented the direction and speed—say the current—of some kind of little “bullets” which were flying out, and if our model required that these bullets were conserved, that none could ever disappear once it was shot out of a charge, then we might say that we can “see” that the inverse square law is necessary."
10389,"On the other hand, there would necessarily be some mathematical way to express this physical idea."
10390,"If the electric field were like conserved bullets going out, then it would vary inversely as the square of the distance and we would be able to describe that behavior by an equation—which is purely mathematical."
10391,"Now there is no harm in thinking this way, so long as we do not say that the electric field is made out of bullets, but realize that we are using a model to help us find the right mathematics."
10392,"Suppose, indeed, that we imagine for a moment that the electric field did represent the flow of something that was conserved—everywhere, that is, except at charges."
10393,(It has to start somewhere!)
10394,We imagine that whatever it is flows out of a charge into the space around.
10395,"Now we wish to use this model to find out how to state the inverse square law in a deeper or more abstract way, rather than simply saying “inverse square.” (You may wonder why we should want to avoid the direct statement of such a simple law, and want instead to imply the same thing sneakily in a different way."
10396,Patience!
10397,It will turn out to be useful.)
10398,First let’s take an easy surface—the one shown in Fig.
10399,4-5.
10400,"On the radial faces, the normal component is zero."
10401,Next we show that the two end surfaces may be tilted with respect to the radial line without changing the integral (4.30).
10402,"Although it is true in general, for our purposes it is only necessary to show that this is true when the end surfaces are small, so that they subtend a small angle from the source—in fact, an infinitesimal angle."
10403,In Fig.
10404,"The end surfaces are not small in the figure, but you are to imagine the situation for very small end surfaces."
10405,"Any volume can be thought of as made up of pieces, like that in Fig."
10406,4-6.
10407,"The surface will be subdivided completely into pairs of end surfaces, and since the fluxes in and out of these end surfaces cancel by pairs, the total flux out of the surface will be zero."
10408,The idea is illustrated in Fig.
10409,4-7.
10410,But notice!
10411,What would happen if the point charge were inside the surface?
10412,"We could still divide our surface into pairs of areas that are matched by radial lines through the charge, as shown in Fig."
10413,4-8.
10414,The fluxes through the two surfaces are still equal—by the same arguments as before—only now they have the same sign.
10415,The flux out of a surface that surrounds a charge is not zero.
10416,Then what is it?
10417,We can find out by a little trick.
10418,4-9.
10419,4-10.
10420,Then we can easily calculate the flux through it.
10421,Let’s return to our “bullet” analogy and see if it makes sense.
10422,Our theorem says that the net flow of bullets through a surface is zero if the surface does not enclose the gun that shoots the bullets.
10423,"If the gun is enclosed in a surface, whatever size and shape it is, the number of bullets passing through is the same—it is given by the rate at which bullets are generated at the gun."
10424,It all seems quite reasonable for conserved bullets.
10425,But does the model tell us anything more than we get simply by writing Eq.
10426,(4.32)?
10427,No one has succeeded in making these “bullets” do anything else but produce this one law.
10428,"After that, they produce nothing but errors."
10429,That is why today we prefer to represent the electromagnetic field purely abstractly.
10430,"Our nice result, Eq."
10431,"(4.32), was proved for a single point charge."
10432,The problem looks more difficult.
10433,The electric field whose normal component we integrate for the flux is the field due to both charges.
10434,"Our result is an important general law of the electrostatic field, called Gauss’ law."
10435,From our derivation you see that Gauss’ law follows from the fact that the exponent in Coulomb’s law is exactly two.
10436,"So Gauss’ law is just an expression, in a different form, of the Coulomb law of forces between two charges."
10437,"In fact, working back from Gauss’ law, you can derive Coulomb’s law."
10438,The two are quite equivalent so long as we keep in mind the rule that the forces between charges are radial.
10439,We would now like to write Gauss’ law in terms of derivatives.
10440,"To do this, we apply Gauss’ law to an infinitesimal cubical surface."
10441,(4.5).
10442,"We have now shown that the two equations of electrostatics, Eqs."
10443,"(4.5) and (4.6), are equivalent to Coulomb’s law of force."
10444,We will now consider one example of the use of Gauss’ law.
10445,(We will come later to many more examples.)
10446,One of the difficult problems we had when we studied the theory of gravitational attractions was to prove that the force produced by a solid sphere of matter was the same at the surface of the sphere as it would be if all the matter were concentrated at the center.
10447,"For many years Newton didn’t make public his theory of gravitation, because he couldn’t be sure this theorem was true."
10448,We proved the theorem in Chapter 13 of Vol.
10449,I by doing the integral for the potential and then finding the gravitational force by using the gradient.
10450,Now we can prove the theorem in a most simple fashion.
10451,Only this time we will prove the corresponding theorem for a uniform sphere of electrical charge.
10452,"(Since the laws of electrostatics are the same as those of gravitation, the same proof could be done for the gravitational field.)"
10453,4-11).
10454,We have proved Newton’s problem more easily than by doing the integral.
10455,"It is, of course, a false kind of easiness—it has taken you some time to be able to understand Gauss’ law, so you may think that no time has really been saved."
10456,"But after you have used the theorem more and more, it begins to pay."
10457,It is a question of efficiency.
10458,We would like now to give a geometrical description of the electrostatic field.
10459,"The two laws of electrostatics, one that the flux is proportional to the charge inside and the other that the electric field is the gradient of a potential, can also be represented geometrically."
10460,We illustrate this with two examples.
10461,"First, we take the field of a point charge."
10462,"We draw lines in the direction of the field—lines which are always tangent to the field, as in Fig."
10463,4-12.
10464,These are called field   lines.
10465,The lines show everywhere the direction of the electric vector.
10466,But we also wish to represent the magnitude of the vector.
10467,We can make the rule that the strength of the electric field will be represented by the “density” of the lines.
10468,By the density of the lines we mean the number of lines per unit area through a surface perpendicular to the lines.
10469,With these two rules we can have a picture of the electric field.
10470,"We can guarantee that there are the same number of lines at every distance if we insist that the lines be continuous—that once a line is started from the charge, it never stops."
10471,"In terms of the field lines, Gauss’ law says that lines should start only at plus charges and stop at minus charges."
10472,We call them equipotential surfaces—surfaces of equal potential.
10473,Now what is the geometrical relationship of the equipotential surfaces to the field lines?
10474,The electric field is the gradient of the potential.
10475,"The gradient is in the direction of the most rapid change of the potential, and is therefore perpendicular to an equipotential surface."
10476,"The potential would be changing in the surface, but then it wouldn’t be an equipotential."
10477,The equipotential surfaces must then be everywhere at right angles to the electric field lines.
10478,"For a point charge all by itself, the equipotential surfaces are spheres centered at the charge."
10479,We have shown in Fig.
10480,4-12 the intersection of these spheres with a plane through the charge.
10481,"As a second example, we consider the field near two equal charges, a positive one and a negative one."
10482,To get the field is easy.
10483,The field is the superposition of the fields from each of the two charges.
10484,"So, we can take two pictures like Fig."
10485,4-12 and superimpose them—impossible!
10486,The disadvantage of the field-line picture is now evident.
10487,By geometrical arguments it is impossible to analyze in a very simple way where the new lines go.
10488,"From the two independent pictures, we can’t get the combined picture."
10489,"The principle of superposition, a simple and deep principle about electric fields, does not have, in the field-line picture, an easy representation."
10490,"The field-line picture has its uses, however, so we might still like to draw the picture for a pair of equal (and opposite) charges."
10491,If we calculate the fields from Eq.
10492,"(4.13) and the potentials from (4.24), we can draw the field lines and equipotentials."
10493,Figure 4-13 shows the result.
10494,But we first had to solve the problem mathematically!
10495,"From these two laws, all the predictions of electrostatics follow."
10496,"But to say these things mathematically is one thing; to use them easily, and with a certain amount of ingenuity, is another."
10497,In this chapter we will work through a number of calculations which can be made with Gauss’ law directly.
10498,"We will prove theorems and describe some effects, particularly in conductors, that can be understood very easily from Gauss’ law."
10499,Gauss’ law by itself cannot give the solution of any problem because the other law must be obeyed too.
10500,"So when we use Gauss’ law for the solution of particular problems, we will have to add something to it."
10501,"We will have to presuppose, for instance, some idea of how the field looks—based, for example, on arguments of symmetry."
10502,Or we may have to introduce specifically the idea that the field is the gradient of a potential.
10503,Consider first the following question: When can a point charge be in stable mechanical equilibrium in the electric field of other charges?
10504,"As an example, imagine three negative charges at the corners of an equilateral triangle in a horizontal plane."
10505,Would a positive charge placed at the center of the triangle remain there?
10506,"(It will be simpler if we ignore gravity for the moment, although including it would not change the results.)"
10507,"The force on the positive charge is zero, but is the equilibrium stable?"
10508,Would the charge return to the equilibrium position if displaced slightly?
10509,The answer is no.
10510,There are no points of stable equilibrium in any electrostatic field—except right on top of another charge.
10511,"Using Gauss’ law, it is easy to see why."
10512,5–1.
10513,"For the case shown in the figure, the flux through the surface must be a negative number."
10514,But Gauss’ law says that the flux of electric field through any surface is proportional to the total charge inside.
10515,It is impossible to balance a positive charge in empty space—at a point where there is not some negative charge.
10516,A positive charge can be in equilibrium if it is in the middle of a distributed negative charge.
10517,"Of course, the negative charge distribution would have to be held in place by other than electrical forces!"
10518,Our result has been obtained for a point charge.
10519,"Does the same conclusion hold for a complicated arrangement of charges held together in fixed relative positions—with rods, for example?"
10520,We consider the question for two equal charges fixed on a rod.
10521,Is it possible that this combination can be in equilibrium in some electrostatic field?
10522,The answer is again no.
10523,The total force on the rod cannot be restoring for displacements in every direction.
10524,You can see that an extension of the argument shows that no rigid combination of any number of charges can have a position of stable equilibrium in an electrostatic field in free space.
10525,Now we have not shown that equilibrium is forbidden if there are pivots or other mechanical constraints.
10526,"As an example, consider a hollow tube in which a charge can move back and forth freely, but not sideways."
10527,Now it is very easy to devise an electric field that points inward at both ends of the tube if it is allowed that the field may point laterally outward near the center of the tube.
10528,"We simply place positive charges at each end of the tube, as in Fig."
10529,5–2.
10530,"The charge, of course, would not be in stable equilibrium for sideways motion were it not for “nonelectrical” forces from the tube walls."
10531,There is no stable spot in the field of a system of fixed charges.
10532,What about a system of charged conductors?
10533,Can a system of charged conductors produce a field that will have a stable equilibrium point for a point charge?
10534,"(We mean at a point other than on a conductor, of course.)"
10535,You know that conductors have the property that charges can move freely around in them.
10536,"Perhaps when the point charge is displaced slightly, the other charges on the conductors will move in a way that will give a restoring force to the point charge?"
10537,The answer is still no—although the proof we have just given doesn’t show it.
10538,"The proof for this case is more difficult, and we will only indicate how it goes."
10539,"First, we note that when charges redistribute themselves on the conductors, they can only do so if their motion decreases their total potential energy."
10540,(Some energy is lost to heat as they move in the conductor.)
10541,Our conclusions do not mean that it is not possible to balance a charge by electrical forces.
10542,It is possible if one is willing to control the locations or the sizes of the supporting charges with suitable devices.
10543,"You know that a rod standing on its point in a gravitational field is unstable, but this does not prove that it cannot be balanced on the end of a finger."
10544,"Similarly, a charge can be held in one spot by electric fields if they are variable."
10545,"But not with a passive—that is, a static—system."
10546,"If charges cannot be held stably in position, it is surely not proper to imagine matter to be made up of static point charges (electrons and protons) governed only by the laws of electrostatics."
10547,Such a static configuration is impossible; it would collapse!
10548,"It was once suggested that the positive charge of an atom could be distributed uniformly in a sphere, and the negative charges, the electrons, could be at rest inside the positive charge, as shown in Fig."
10549,5–3.
10550,"This was the first atomic model, proposed by Thomson."
10551,"But Rutherford concluded from the experiment of Geiger and Marsden that the positive charges were very much concentrated, in what he called the nucleus."
10552,Thomson’s static model had to be abandoned.
10553,"Rutherford and Bohr then suggested that the equilibrium might be dynamic, with the electrons revolving in orbits, as shown in Fig."
10554,5–4.
10555,The electrons would be kept from falling in toward the nucleus by their orbital motion.
10556,We already know at least one difficulty with this picture.
10557,"With such motion, the electrons would be accelerating (because of the circular motion) and would, therefore, be radiating energy."
10558,"They would lose the kinetic energy required to stay in orbit, and would spiral in toward the nucleus."
10559,Again unstable!
10560,The stability of the atoms is now explained in terms of quantum mechanics.
10561,"The electrostatic forces pull the electron as close to the nucleus as possible, but the electron is compelled to stay spread out in space over a distance given by the uncertainty principle."
10562,"If it were confined in too small a space, it would have a great uncertainty in momentum."
10563,But that means that it would have a high expected energy—which it would use to escape from the electrical attraction.
10564,The net result is an electrical equilibrium not too different from the idea of Thomson—only it is the negative charge that is spread out (because the mass of the electron is so much smaller than the mass of the proton).
10565,"Gauss’ law can be used to solve a number of electrostatic field problems involving a special symmetry—usually spherical, cylindrical, or planar symmetry."
10566,In the remainder of this chapter we will apply Gauss’ law to a few such problems.
10567,"The ease with which these problems can be solved may give the misleading impression that the method is very powerful, and that one should be able to go on to many other problems."
10568,It is unfortunately not so.
10569,One soon exhausts the list of problems that can be solved easily with Gauss’ law.
10570,In later chapters we will develop more powerful methods for investigating electrostatic fields.
10571,"As our first example, we consider a system with cylindrical symmetry."
10572,"Suppose that we have a very long, uniformly charged rod."
10573,We wish to know the electric field.
10574,"The problem can, of course, be solved by integrating the contribution to the field from every part of the line."
10575,"We are going to do it without integrating, by using Gauss’ law and some guesswork."
10576,"First, we surmise that the electric field will be directed radially outward from the line."
10577,Any axial component from charges on one side would be accompanied by an equal axial component from charges on the other side.
10578,The result could only be a radial field.
10579,It also seems reasonable that the field should have the same magnitude at all points equidistant from the line.
10580,This is obvious.
10581,"(It may not be easy to prove, but it is true if space is symmetric—as we believe it is.)"
10582,We can use Gauss’ law in the following way.
10583,"We consider an imaginary surface in the shape of a cylinder coaxial with the line, as shown in Fig."
10584,5–5.
10585,"Since the field is assumed to be normal to the surface, the normal component is the magnitude of the field."
10586,The flux through the two end faces is zero because the electric field is tangential to them.
10587,"As another example, we will calculate the field from a uniform plane sheet of charge."
10588,We are going to take another guess.
10589,"Considerations of symmetry lead us to believe that the field direction is everywhere normal to the plane, and if we have no field from any other charges in the world, the fields must be the same (in magnitude) on each side."
10590,"This time we choose for our Gaussian surface a rectangular box that cuts through the sheet, as shown in Fig."
10591,5–6.
10592,"The field is normal to these two faces, and parallel to the other four."
10593,You may remember that the same result was obtained in an earlier chapter by an integration over the entire surface.
10594,"Gauss’ law gives us the answer, in this instance, much more quickly (although it is not as generally applicable as the earlier method)."
10595,We emphasize that this result applies only to the field due to the charges on the sheet.
10596,"If there are other charges in the neighborhood, the total field near the sheet would be the sum of (5.3) and the field of the other charges."
10597,"Either by superposing two solutions for a single sheet or by constructing a Gaussian box that includes both sheets, it is easily seen that the field is zero outside of the two sheets (Fig."
10598,5–7a).
10599,"By considering a box that includes only one surface or the other, as in (b) or (c) of the figure, it can be seen that the field between the sheets must be twice what it is for a single sheet."
10600,We have already (in Chapter 4) used Gauss’ law to find the field outside a uniformly charged spherical region.
10601,The same method can also give us the field at points inside the sphere.
10602,"For example, the computation can be used to obtain a good approximation to the field inside an atomic nucleus."
10603,"In spite of the fact that the protons in a nucleus repel each other, they are, because of the strong nuclear forces, spread nearly uniformly throughout the body of the nucleus."
10604,"Again using arguments of symmetry, we assume the field to be radial and equal in magnitude at all points at the same distance from the center."
10605,5–8.
10606,The electric field is proportional to the radius and is directed radially outward.
10607,The arguments we have just given for a uniformly charged sphere can be applied also to a thin spherical shell of charge.
10608,"Assuming that the field is everywhere radial and is spherically symmetric, one gets immediately from Gauss’ law that the field outside the shell is like that of a point charge, while the field everywhere inside the shell is zero."
10609,(A Gaussian surface inside the shell will contain no charge.)
10610,"If we look in a little more detail at how the field inside the shell gets to be zero, we can see more clearly why it is that Gauss’ law is true only because the Coulomb force depends exactly on the square of the distance."
10611,5–9.
10612,The validity of Gauss’ law depends upon the inverse square law of Coulomb.
10613,"If the force law were not exactly the inverse square, it would not be true that the field inside a uniformly charged sphere would be exactly zero."
10614,These conclusions suggest an elegant way of finding out whether the inverse square law is precisely correct.
10615,We need only determine whether or not the field inside of a uniformly charged spherical shell is precisely zero.
10616,It is lucky that such a method exists.
10617,"It is usually difficult to measure a physical quantity to high precision—a one percent result may not be too difficult, but how would one go about measuring, say, Coulomb’s law to an accuracy of one part in a billion?"
10618,It is almost certainly not possible with the best available techniques to measure the force between two charged objects with such an accuracy.
10619,"But by determining only that the electric fields inside a charged sphere are smaller than some value we can make a highly accurate measurement of the correctness of Gauss’ law, and hence of the inverse square dependence of Coulomb’s law."
10620,"What one does, in effect, is compare the force law to an ideal inverse square."
10621,"Such comparisons of things that are equal, or nearly so, are usually the bases of the most precise physical measurements."
10622,How shall we observe the field inside a charged sphere?
10623,One way is to try to charge an object by touching it to the inside of a spherical conductor.
10624,You know that if we touch a small metal ball to a charged object and then touch it to an electrometer the meter will become charged and the pointer will move from zero (Fig.
10625,5–10a).
10626,The ball picks up charge because there are electric fields outside the charged sphere that cause charges to run onto (or off) the little ball.
10627,"If you do the same experiment by touching the little ball to the inside of the charged sphere, you find that no charge is carried to the electrometer."
10628,"With such an experiment you can easily show that the field inside is, at most, a few percent of the field outside, and that Gauss’ law is at least approximately correct."
10629,It appears that Benjamin Franklin was the first to notice that the field inside a conducting shell is zero.
10630,The result seemed strange to him.
10631,"When he reported his observation to Priestley, the latter suggested that it might be connected with an inverse square law, since it was known that a spherical shell of matter produced no gravitational field inside."
10632,"But Coulomb didn’t measure the inverse square dependence until 18 years later, and Gauss’ law came even later still."
10633,Gauss’ law has been checked carefully by putting an electrometer inside a large sphere and observing whether any deflections occur when the sphere is charged to a high voltage.
10634,A null result is always obtained.
10635,"Knowing the geometry of the apparatus and the sensitivity of the meter, it is possible to compute the minimum field that would be observed."
10636,From this number it is possible to place an upper limit on the deviation of the exponent from two.
10637,The experiment was repeated and improved upon in 1936 by Plimpton and Lawton.
10638,They found that Coulomb’s exponent differs from two by less than one part in a billion.
10639,Now that brings up an interesting question: How accurate do we know this Coulomb law to be in various circumstances?
10640,The experiments we just described measure the dependence of the field on distance for distances of some tens of centimeters.
10641,"But what about the distances inside an atom—in the hydrogen atom, for instance, where we believe the electron is attracted to the nucleus by the same inverse square law?"
10642,"It is true that quantum mechanics must be used for the mechanical part of the behavior of the electron, but the force is the usual electrostatic one."
10643,"In the formulation of the problem, the potential energy of an electron must be known as a function of distance from the nucleus, and Coulomb’s law gives a potential which varies inversely with the first power of the distance."
10644,How accurately is the exponent known for such small distances?
10645,Is the same exponent correct at still shorter distances?
10646,We shall look at some of the evidence in a later chapter.
10647,This range can be investigated by bombarding protons with very energetic electrons and observing how they are scattered.
10648,Results to date seem to indicate that the law fails at these distances.
10649,Now there are two possible explanations.
10650,"One is that the Coulomb law does not work at such small distances; the other is that our objects, the electrons and protons, are not point charges."
10651,"Perhaps either the electron or proton, or both, is some kind of a smear."
10652,Most physicists prefer to think that the charge of the proton is smeared.
10653,We know that protons interact strongly with mesons.
10654,Such a configuration would act—on the average—like a little sphere of positive charge.
10655,"It is quite likely that the proton charge is smeared, but the theory of pions is still quite incomplete, so it may also be that Coulomb’s law fails at very small distances."
10656,The question is still open.
10657,We go back now to an important matter that we slighted when we spoke of the experimental verification of Gauss’ law.
10658,You may have wondered how the experiment of Maxwell or of Plimpton and Lawton could give such an accuracy unless the spherical conductor they used was a perfect sphere.
10659,"An accuracy of one part in a billion is really something to achieve, and you might well ask whether they could make a sphere which was that precise."
10660,"There are certain to be slight irregularities in any real sphere and if there are irregularities, will they not produce fields inside?"
10661,We wish to show now that it is not necessary to have a perfect sphere.
10662,"It is possible, in fact, to show that there is no field inside a closed conducting shell of any shape."
10663,"To show this, it is necessary to know some of the properties of electrical conductors."
10664,An electrical conductor is a solid that contains many “free” electrons.
10665,"The electrons can move around freely in the material, but cannot leave the surface."
10666,In a metal there are so many free electrons that any electric field will set large numbers of them into motion.
10667,"Either the current of electrons so set up must be continually kept moving by external sources of energy, or the motion of the electrons will cease as they discharge the sources producing the initial field."
10668,"In “electrostatic” situations, we do not consider continuous sources of current (they will be considered later when we study magnetostatics), so the electrons move only until they have arranged themselves to produce zero electric field everywhere inside the conductor."
10669,(This usually happens in a small fraction of a second.)
10670,"If there were any field left, this field would urge still more electrons to move; the only electrostatic solution is that the field is everywhere zero inside."
10671,Now consider the interior of a charged conducting object.
10672,(By “interior” we mean in the metal itself.)
10673,"Every conductor is an equipotential region, and its surface is an equipotential surface."
10674,"If there can be no charges in a conductor, how can it ever be charged?"
10675,What do we mean when we say a conductor is “charged”?
10676,Where are the charges?
10677,"The answer is that they reside at the surface of the conductor, where there are strong forces to keep them from leaving—they are not completely “free.” When we study solid-state physics, we shall find that the excess charge of any conductor is on the average within one or two atomic layers of the surface."
10678,"For our present purposes, it is accurate enough to say that if any charge is put on, or in, a conductor it all accumulates on the surface; there is no charge in the interior of a conductor."
10679,We note also that the electric field just outside the surface of a conductor must be normal to the surface.
10680,There can be no tangential component.
10681,"If there were a tangential component, the electrons would move along the surface; there are no forces preventing that."
10682,Saying it another way: we know that the electric field lines must always go at right angles to an equipotential surface.
10683,"We can also, using Gauss’ law, relate the field strength just outside a conductor to the local density of the charge at the surface."
10684,"For a Gaussian surface, we take a small cylindrical box half inside and half outside the surface, like the one shown in Fig."
10685,5–11.
10686,Why does a sheet of charge on a conductor produce a different field than just a sheet of charge?
10687,"In other words, why is (5.8) twice as large as (5.3)?"
10688,"The reason, of course, is that we have not said for the conductor that there are no “other” charges around."
10689,We return now to the problem of the hollow container—a conductor with a cavity.
10690,"There is no field in the metal, but what about in the cavity?"
10691,"We shall show that if the cavity is empty then there are no fields in it, no matter what the shape of the conductor or the cavity—say for the one in Fig."
10692,5–12.
10693,"5–12, that encloses the cavity but stays everywhere in the conducting material."
10694,"For a spherical shell, one could then argue from symmetry that there could be no charge inside."
10695,"But, in general, we can only say that there are equal amounts of positive and negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor."
10696,"There could be a positive surface charge on one part and a negative one somewhere else, as indicated in Fig."
10697,5–12.
10698,Such a thing cannot be ruled out by Gauss’ law.
10699,"What really happens, of course, is that any equal and opposite charges on the inner surface would slide around to meet each other, cancelling out completely."
10700,Suppose there were charges on some parts of the inner surface.
10701,We know that there would have to be an equal number of opposite charges somewhere else.
10702,5–12).
10703,The integral along such a line of force from the positive to the negative charges would not be zero.
10704,"So there can be no fields inside the empty cavity, nor any charges on the inside surface."
10705,You should notice carefully one important qualification we have made.
10706,We have always said “inside an empty” cavity.
10707,If some charges are placed at some fixed locations in the cavity—as on an insulator or on a small conductor insulated from the main one—then there can be fields in the cavity.
10708,But then that is not an “empty” cavity.
10709,"We have shown that if a cavity is completely enclosed by a conductor, no static distribution of charges outside can ever produce any fields inside."
10710,This explains the principle of “shielding” electrical equipment by placing it in a metal can.
10711,The same arguments can be used to show that no static distribution of charges inside a closed grounded conductor can produce any fields outside.
10712,Shielding works both ways!
10713,In electrostatics—but not in varying fields—the fields on the two sides of a closed grounded conducting shell are completely independent.
10714,Now you see why it was possible to check Coulomb’s law to such a great precision.
10715,The shape of the hollow shell used doesn’t matter.
10716,It doesn’t need to be spherical; it could be square!
10717,"If Gauss’ law is exact, the field inside is always zero."
10718,"Now you also understand why it is safe to sit inside the high-voltage terminal of a million-volt Van de Graaff generator, without worrying about getting a shock—because of Gauss’ law."
10719,This chapter will describe the behavior of the electric field in a number of different circumstances.
10720,"It will provide some experience with the way the electric field behaves, and will describe some of the mathematical methods which are used to find this field."
10721,(6.6) is called the Poisson equation.
10722,"The entire subject of electrostatics, from a mathematical point of view, is merely a study of the solutions of the single equation (6.6)."
10723,(6.3).
10724,"In that case the problem is almost trivial, for we already know the solution of Eq."
10725,(6.6) for the general case.
10726,The solution of the differential equation (6.6) is reduced to an integration over space.
10727,(6.7) is a prototype of the solution for any of these problems.
10728,The solution of electrostatic field problems is thus completely straightforward when the positions of all the charges are known.
10729,Let’s see how it works in a few examples.
10730,6–1.
10731,So we have solved the problem of two charges.
10732,There is an important special case in which the two charges are very close together—which is to say that we are interested in the fields only at distances from the charges large in comparison with their separation.
10733,We call such a close pair of charges a dipole.
10734,Dipoles are very common.
10735,A “dipole” antenna can often be approximated by two charges separated by a small distance—if we don’t ask about the field too close to the antenna.
10736,"(We are usually interested in antennas with moving charges; then the equations of statics do not really apply, but for some purposes they are an adequate approximation.)"
10737,"More important perhaps, are atomic dipoles."
10738,"If there is an electric field in any material, the electrons and protons feel opposite forces and are displaced relative to each other."
10739,"In a conductor, you remember, some of the electrons move to the surfaces, so that the field inside becomes zero."
10740,In an insulator the electrons cannot move very far; they are pulled back by the attraction of the nucleus.
10741,"They do, however, shift a little bit."
10742,"So although an atom, or molecule, remains neutral in an external electric field, there is a very tiny separation of its positive and negative charges and it becomes a microscopic dipole."
10743,"If we are interested in the fields of these atomic dipoles in the neighborhood of ordinary-sized objects, we are normally dealing with distances large compared with the separations of the pairs of charges."
10744,"In some molecules the charges are somewhat separated even in the absence of external fields, because of the form of the molecule."
10745,"In a water molecule, for example, there is a net negative charge on the oxygen atom and a net positive charge on each of the two hydrogen atoms, which are not placed symmetrically but as in Fig."
10746,6–2.
10747,"Although the charge of the whole molecule is zero, there is a charge distribution with a little more negative charge on one side and a little more positive charge on the other."
10748,"This arrangement is certainly not as simple as two point charges, but when seen from far away the system acts like a dipole."
10749,"As we shall see a little later, the field at large distances is not sensitive to the fine details."
10750,6–1.
10751,6–3).
10752,The dipole field varies inversely as the cube of the distance from the dipole.
10753,6–4).
10754,This is a good place to make a general remark about vector analysis.
10755,"The fundamental proofs can be expressed by elegant equations in a general form, but in making various calculations and analyses it is always a good idea to choose the axes in some convenient way."
10756,This made the work much easier.
10757,But then we wrote the equations in vector form so that they would no longer depend on any particular coordinate system.
10758,"After that, we are allowed to choose any coordinate system we wish, knowing that the relation is, in general, true."
10759,It clearly doesn’t make any sense to bother with an arbitrary coordinate system at some complicated angle when you can choose a neat system for the particular problem—provided that the result can finally be expressed as a vector equation.
10760,So by all means take advantage of the fact that vector equations are independent of any coordinate system.
10761,There often seems to be a feeling that there is something inelegant—some kind of defeat involved—in writing out the components; that somehow there ought always to be a way to do everything with the vector operators.
10762,There is often no advantage to it.
10763,"The first time we encounter a particular kind of problem, it usually helps to write out the components to be sure we understand what is going on."
10764,"There is nothing inelegant about putting numbers into equations, and nothing inelegant about substituting the derivatives for the fancy symbols."
10765,"In fact, there is often a certain cleverness in doing just that."
10766,Of course when you publish a paper in a professional journal it will look better—and be more easily understood—if you can write everything in vector form.
10767,"Besides, it saves print."
10768,"We would like to point out a rather amusing thing about the dipole formula, Eq."
10769,(6.13).
10770,(6.16) is the same as Eq.
10771,(6.13).
10772,How did we think of that?
10773,There is a physical reason for being able to write the dipole potential in the form of Eq.
10774,(6.16).
10775,6–5).
10776,We should then write the equation above Eq.
10777,"Completing the derivation as before, Eq."
10778,"Looking at it another way, we see that the dipole potential, Eq."
10779,"Although we can always find the potential of a known charge distribution by an integration, it is sometimes possible to save time by getting the answer with a clever trick."
10780,"For example, one can often make use of the superposition principle."
10781,"If we are given a charge distribution that can be made up of the sum of two distributions for which the potentials are already known, it is easy to find the desired potential by just adding the two known ones."
10782,"One example of this is our derivation of (6.20), another is the following."
10783,Suppose we have a spherical surface with a distribution of surface charge that varies as the cosine of the polar angle.
10784,The integration for this distribution is fairly messy.
10785,"But, surprisingly, such a distribution can be analyzed by superposition."
10786,"For imagine a sphere with a uniform volume density of positive charge, and another sphere with an equal uniform volume density of negative charge, originally superposed to make a neutral—that is, uncharged—sphere."
10787,"If the positive sphere is then displaced slightly with respect to the negative sphere, the body of the uncharged sphere would remain neutral, but a little positive charge will appear on one side, and some negative charge will appear on the opposite side, as illustrated in Fig."
10788,6–6.
10789,"If the relative displacement of the two spheres is small, the net charge is equivalent to a surface charge (on a spherical surface), and the surface charge density will be proportional to the cosine of the polar angle."
10790,"Now if we want the potential from this distribution, we do not need to do an integral."
10791,We know that the potential from each of the spheres of charge is—for points outside the sphere—the same as from a point charge.
10792,The two displaced spheres are like two point charges; the potential is just that of a dipole.
10793,The example we have just considered is not as artificial as it may appear; we will encounter it again in the theory of dielectrics.
10794,The dipole field appears in another circumstance both interesting and important.
10795,Suppose that we have an object that has a complicated distribution of charge—like the water molecule (Fig.
10796,6–2)—and we are interested only in the fields far away.
10797,We will show that it is possible to find a relatively simple expression for the fields which is appropriate for distances large compared with the size of the object.
10798,6–7.
10799,"Thus we find that for points far enough from any lump of charge, the lump looks like a point charge."
10800,The result is not too surprising.
10801,But what if there are equal numbers of positive and negative charges?
10802,"This is not an unusual case; in fact, as we know, objects are usually neutral."
10803,"The water molecule is neutral, but the charges are not all at one point, so if we are close enough we should be able to see some effects of the separate charges."
10804,We need a better approximation than (6.22) for the potential from an arbitrary distribution of charge in a neutral object.
10805,6–7.
10806,The first term in (6.25) is what we got before; it drops out if the object is neutral.
10807,"It is a generalization of our earlier definition, and reduces to it for the special case of two point charges."
10808,"Our result is that, far enough away from any mess of charges that is as a whole neutral, the potential is a dipole potential."
10809,"It is for these reasons that dipole fields are important, since the simple case of a pair of point charges is quite rare."
10810,"The water molecule, for example, has a rather strong dipole moment."
10811,The electric fields that result from this moment are responsible for some of the important properties of water.
10812,We will discuss such cases later.
10813,We have now finished with the examples we wish to cover of situations in which the charge distribution is known from the start.
10814,"It has been a problem without serious complications, involving at most some integrations."
10815,"We turn now to an entirely new kind of problem, the determination of the fields near charged conductors."
10816,Now we will not be able to say exactly where the charges are.
10817,They will spread out in some way on the surface.
10818,How can we know how the charges have distributed themselves on the surface?
10819,They must distribute themselves so that the potential of the surface is constant.
10820,"If the surface were not an equipotential, there would be an electric field inside the conductor, and the charges would keep moving until it became zero."
10821,The general problem of this kind can be solved in the following way.
10822,We guess at a distribution of charge and calculate the potential.
10823,"If the potential turns out to be constant everywhere on the surface, the problem is finished."
10824,"If the surface is not an equipotential, we have guessed the wrong distribution of charges, and should guess again—hopefully with an improved guess!"
10825,"This can go on forever, unless we are judicious about the successive guesses."
10826,The question of how to guess at the distribution is mathematically difficult.
10827,"Nature, of course, has time to do it; the charges push and pull until they all balance themselves."
10828,"When we try to solve the problem, however, it takes us so long to make each trial that that method is very tedious."
10829,"With an arbitrary group of conductors and charges the problem can be very complicated, and in general it cannot be solved without rather elaborate numerical methods."
10830,"Such numerical computations, these days, are set up on a computing machine that will do the work for us, once we have told it how to proceed."
10831,"On the other hand, there are a lot of little practical cases where it would be nice to be able to find the answer by some more direct method—without having to write a program for a computer."
10832,"Fortunately, there are a number of cases where the answer can be obtained by squeezing it out of Nature by some trick or other."
10833,The first trick we will describe involves making use of solutions we have already obtained for situations in which charges have specified locations.
10834,"We have solved, for example, the field of two point charges."
10835,Figure 6–8 shows some of the field lines and equipotential surfaces we obtained by the computations in Chapter 4.
10836,Suppose we were to shape a thin sheet of metal so that it just fits this surface.
10837,"If we place it right at the surface and adjust its potential to the proper value, no one would ever know it was there, because nothing would be changed."
10838,But notice!
10839,We have really solved a new problem.
10840,We have a situation in which the surface of a curved conductor with a given potential is placed near a point charge.
10841,"If the metal sheet we placed at the equipotential surface eventually closes on itself (or, in practice, if it goes far enough) we have the kind of situation considered in Section 5–10, in which our space is divided into two regions, one inside and one outside a closed conducting shell."
10842,We found there that the fields in the two regions are quite independent of each other.
10843,So we would have the same fields outside our curved conductor no matter what is inside.
10844,We can even fill up the whole inside with conducting material.
10845,"We have found, therefore, the fields for the arrangement of Fig."
10846,6–9.
10847,"In the space outside the conductor the field is just like that of two point charges, as in Fig."
10848,6–8.
10849,"Inside the conductor, it is zero."
10850,Also—as it must be—the electric field just outside the conductor is normal to the surface.
10851,Thus we can compute the fields in Fig.
10852,The point charge we “imagine” existing behind the conducting surface is called an image charge.
10853,"In books you can find long lists of solutions for hyperbolic-shaped conductors and other complicated looking things, and you wonder how anyone ever solved these terrible shapes."
10854,They were solved backwards!
10855,Someone solved a simple problem with given charges.
10856,"He then saw that some equipotential surface showed up in a new shape, and he wrote a paper in which he pointed out that the field outside that particular shape can be described in a certain way."
10857,6–8.
10858,"With it, we can solve the problem of a charge in front of a conducting sheet."
10859,We just cross out the left-hand half of the picture.
10860,The field lines for our solution are shown in Fig.
10861,6–10.
10862,"Notice that the plane, since it was halfway between the two charges, has zero potential."
10863,We have solved the problem of a positive charge next to a grounded conducting sheet.
10864,"We have now solved for the total field, but what about the real charges that are responsible for it?"
10865,"There are, in addition to our positive point charge, some induced negative charges on the conducting sheet that have been attracted by the positive charge (from large distances away)."
10866,Now suppose that for some technical reason—or out of curiosity—you would like to know how the negative charges are distributed on the surface.
10867,You can find the surface charge density by using the result we worked out in Section 5–9 with Gauss’ law.
10868,We can obtain the density of charge at any point on the surface by working backwards from the normal component of the electric field at the surface.
10869,"We know that, because we know the field everywhere."
10870,6–10).
10871,The electric field at this point is normal to the surface and is directed into it.
10872,One further question: Is there a force on the point charge?
10873,"Yes, because there is an attraction from the induced negative surface charge on the plate."
10874,Now that we know what the surface charges are (from Eq.
10875,"6.29), we could compute the force on our positive point charge by an integral."
10876,"But we also know that the force acting on the positive charge is exactly the same as it would be with the negative image charge instead of the plate, because the fields in the neighborhood are the same in both cases."
10877,What other surfaces besides a plane have a simple solution?
10878,The next most simple shape is a sphere.
10879,6–11.
10880,Now we must look for a simple physical situation which gives a sphere for an equipotential surface.
10881,"If we look around at problems people have already solved, we find that someone has noticed that the field of two unequal point charges has an equipotential that is a sphere."
10882,Aha!
10883,If we choose the location of an image charge—and pick the right amount of charge—maybe we can make the equipotential surface fit our sphere.
10884,"Indeed, it can be done with the following prescription."
10885,The sphere will be at zero potential.
10886,The mathematical reason stems from the fact that a sphere is the locus of all points for which the distances from two points are in a constant ratio.
10887,Referring to Fig.
10888,"Its potential is, in fact, zero."
10889,What happens if we are interested in a sphere that is not at zero potential?
10890,"Of course if it is grounded, the charges induced on it would have to be just that."
10891,"But what if it is insulated, and we have put no charge on it?"
10892,Or just that it has a given potential not equal to zero?
10893,All these questions are easily answered.
10894,The sphere still remains an equipotential by superposition; only the magnitude of the potential will be changed.
10895,The problem is solved.
10896,It is not zero even though there is no charge on the neutral sphere.
10897,Where does the attraction come from?
10898,"When you bring a positive charge up to a conducting sphere, the positive charge attracts negative charges to the side closer to itself and leaves positive charges on the surface of the far side."
10899,The attraction by the negative charges exceeds the repulsion from the positive charges; there is a net attraction.
10900,Those who were entertained in childhood by the baking powder box which has on its label a picture of a baking powder box which has on its label a picture of a baking powder box which has … may be interested in the following problem.
10901,What is the force between them?
10902,The problem can be solved with an infinite number of images.
10903,One first approximates each sphere by a charge at its center.
10904,These charges will have image charges in the other sphere.
10905,"The image charges will have images, etc., etc., etc."
10906,The solution is like the picture on the box of baking powder—and it converges pretty fast.
10907,We take up now another kind of a problem involving conductors.
10908,Consider two large metal plates which are parallel to each other and separated by a distance small compared with their width.
10909,Let’s suppose that equal and opposite charges have been put on the plates.
10910,"The charges on each plate will be attracted by the charges on the other plate, and the charges will spread out uniformly on the inner surfaces of the plates."
10911,6–12.
10912,We find that the voltage is proportional to the charge.
10913,"The potential difference between them—that is, the voltage—will be proportional to the charge."
10914,(We are assuming that there are no other charges around.)
10915,Why this proportionality?
10916,Just the superposition principle.
10917,"Suppose we know the solution for one set of charges, and then we superimpose two such solutions."
10918,"The charges are doubled, the fields are doubled, and the work done in carrying a unit charge from one point to the other is also doubled."
10919,Therefore the potential difference between any two points is proportional to the charges.
10920,"In particular, the potential difference between the two conductors is proportional to the charges on them."
10921,Someone originally wrote the equation of proportionality the other way.
10922,"This formula is not exact, because the field is not really uniform everywhere between the plates, as we assumed."
10923,"The field does not just suddenly quit at the edges, but really is more as shown in Fig."
10924,6–13.
10925,"To find out what the correction is, we will have to calculate the field more exactly and find out just what does happen at the edges."
10926,"That is a complicated mathematical problem which can, however, be solved by techniques which we will not describe now."
10927,The result of such calculations is that the charge density rises somewhat near the edges of the plates.
10928,This means that the capacity of the plates is a little higher than we computed.
10929,We have talked about the capacity for two conductors only.
10930,Sometimes people talk about the capacity of a single object.
10931,"One can also speak of capacities when there are three or more conductors, a discussion we shall, however, defer."
10932,Suppose that we wish to have a condenser with a very large capacity.
10933,We could get a large capacity by taking a very big area and a very small separation.
10934,We could put waxed paper between sheets of aluminum foil and roll it up.
10935,"(If we seal it in plastic, we have a typical radio-type condenser.)"
10936,What good is it?
10937,It is good for storing charge.
10938,"If we try to store charge on a ball, for example, its potential rises rapidly as we charge it up."
10939,It may even get so high that the charge begins to escape into the air by way of sparks.
10940,"But if we put the same charge on a condenser whose capacity is very large, the voltage developed across the condenser will be small."
10941,"In many applications in electronic circuits, it is useful to have something which can absorb or deliver large quantities of charge without changing its potential much."
10942,A condenser (or “capacitor”) does just that.
10943,There are also many applications in electronic instruments and in computers where a condenser is used to get a specified change in voltage in response to a particular change in charge.
10944,"We have seen a similar application in Chapter 23, Vol."
10945,"I, where we described the properties of resonant circuits."
10946,This unit is also called a farad.
10947,Looking at Eq.
10948,"Small condensers of a few picofarads are used in high-frequency tuned circuits, and capacities up to hundreds or thousands of microfarads are found in power-supply filters."
10949,A pair of plates one square centimeter in area with a one millimeter separation have a capacity of roughly one micro-microfarad.
10950,We would like now to discuss qualitatively some of the characteristics of the fields around conductors.
10951,"If we charge a conductor that is not a sphere, but one that has on it a point or a very sharp end, as, for example, the object sketched in Fig."
10952,"6–14, the field around the point is much higher than the field in the other regions."
10953,"The reason is, qualitatively, that charges try to spread out as much as possible on the surface of a conductor, and the tip of a sharp point is as far away as it is possible to be from most of the surface."
10954,Some of the charges on the plate get pushed all the way to the tip.
10955,A relatively small amount of charge on the tip can still provide a large surface density; a high charge density means a high field just outside.
10956,"One way to see that the field is highest at those places on a conductor where the radius of curvature is smallest is to consider the combination of a big sphere and a little sphere connected by a wire, as shown in Fig."
10957,6–15.
10958,It is a somewhat idealized version of the conductor of Fig.
10959,6–14.
10960,The wire will have little influence on the fields outside; it is there to keep the spheres at the same potential.
10961,"Now, which ball has the biggest field at its surface?"
10962,"But if we are interested only in an estimate of the fields, we can use the potential of a spherical charge.)"
10963,"5.8) is proportional to the surface charge density, which is like the total charge over the radius squared."
10964,The fields are in the inverse proportion of the radii.
10965,"This result is technically very important, because air will break down if the electric field is too great."
10966,"What happens is that a loose charge (electron, or ion) somewhere in the air is accelerated by the field, and if the field is very great, the charge can pick up enough speed before it hits another atom to be able to knock an electron off that atom."
10967,"As a result, more and more ions are produced."
10968,"Their motion constitutes a discharge, or spark."
10969,"If you want to charge an object to a high potential and not have it discharge itself by sparks in the air, you must be sure that the surface is smooth, so that there is no place where the field is abnormally large."
10970,There is an interesting application of the extremely high electric field which surrounds any sharp protuberance on a charged conductor.
10971,The field-emission microscope depends for its operation on the high fields produced at a sharp metal point.2 It is built in the following way.
10972,6–16).
10973,"The inner surface of the sphere is coated with a thin conducting layer of fluorescent material, and a very high potential difference is applied between the fluorescent coating and the needle."
10974,Let’s first consider what happens when the needle is negative with respect to the fluorescent coating.
10975,The field lines are highly concentrated at the sharp point.
10976,"In such intense fields, electrons are pulled out of the surface of the needle and accelerated across the potential difference between the needle and the fluorescent layer."
10977,"When they arrive there they cause light to be emitted, just as in a television picture tube."
10978,"The electrons which arrive at a given point on the fluorescent surface are, to an excellent approximation, those which leave the other end of the radial field line, because the electrons will travel along the field line passing from the point to the surface."
10979,Thus we see on the surface some kind of an image of the tip of the needle.
10980,"More precisely, we see a picture of the emissivity of the surface of the needle—that is the ease with which electrons can leave the surface of the metal tip."
10981,"If the resolution were high enough, one could hope to resolve the positions of the individual atoms on the tip of the needle."
10982,"With electrons, this resolution is not possible for the following reasons."
10983,"First, there is quantum-mechanical diffraction of the electron waves which blurs the image."
10984,"Second, due to the internal motions of the electrons in the metal they have a small sideways initial velocity when they leave the needle, and this random transverse component of the velocity causes some smearing of the image."
10985,"If, however, we reverse the polarity and introduce a small amount of helium gas into the bulb, much higher resolutions are possible."
10986,"When a helium atom collides with the tip of the needle, the intense field there strips an electron off the helium atom, leaving it positively charged."
10987,The helium ion is then accelerated outward along a field line to the fluorescent screen.
10988,"Since the helium ion is so much heavier than an electron, the quantum-mechanical wavelengths are much smaller."
10989,"If the temperature is not too high, the effect of the thermal velocities is also smaller than in the electron case."
10990,With less smearing of the image a much sharper picture of the point is obtained.
10991,"Figure 6–17 is an example of the results which were obtained with a field-ion microscope, using a tungsten needle."
10992,The center of a tungsten atom ionizes a helium atom at a slightly different rate than the spaces between the tungsten atoms.
10993,The pattern of spots on the fluorescent screen shows the arrangement of the individual atoms on the tungsten tip.
10994,"The reason the spots appear in rings can be understood by visualizing a large box of balls packed in a rectangular array, representing the atoms in the metal."
10995,"If you cut an approximately spherical section out of this box, you will see the ring pattern characteristic of the atomic structure."
10996,The field-ion microscope provided human beings with the means of seeing atoms for the first time.
10997,"This is a remarkable achievement, considering the simplicity of the instrument."
10998,This chapter is a continuation of our consideration of the characteristics of electric fields in various particular situations.
10999,We shall first describe some of the more elaborate methods for solving problems with conductors.
11000,It is not expected that these more advanced methods can be mastered at this time.
11001,"Yet it may be of interest to have some idea about the kinds of problems that can be solved, using techniques that may be learned in more advanced courses."
11002,"Then we take up two examples in which the charge distribution is neither fixed nor is carried by a conductor, but instead is determined by some other law of physics."
11003,"As we found in Chapter 6, the problem of the electrostatic field is fundamentally simple when the distribution of charges is specified; it requires only the evaluation of an integral."
11004,"When there are conductors present, however, complications arise because the charge distribution on the conductors is not initially known; the charge must distribute itself on the surface of the conductor in such a way that the conductor is an equipotential."
11005,The solution of such problems is neither direct nor simple.
11006,"We have looked at an indirect method of solving such problems, in which we find the equipotentials for some specified charge distribution and replace one of them by a conducting surface."
11007,"In this way we can build up a catalog of special solutions for conductors in the shapes of spheres, planes, etc."
11008,"The use of images, described in Chapter 6, is an example of an indirect method."
11009,We shall describe another in this chapter.
11010,"If the problem to be solved does not belong to the class of problems for which we can construct solutions by the indirect method, we are forced to solve the problem by a more direct method."
11011,Problems which involve the solution of a differential field equation subject to certain boundary conditions are called boundary-value problems.
11012,They have been the object of considerable mathematical study.
11013,"In the case of conductors having complicated shapes, there are no general analytical methods."
11014,Even such a simple problem as that of a charged cylindrical metal can closed at both ends—a beer can—presents formidable mathematical difficulties.
11015,"It can be solved only approximately, using numerical methods."
11016,The only general methods of solution are numerical.
11017,There are a few problems for which Eq.
11018,(7.1) can be solved directly.
11019,"For example, the problem of a charged conductor having the shape of an ellipsoid of revolution can be solved exactly in terms of known special functions."
11020,The solution for a thin disc can be obtained by letting the ellipsoid become infinitely oblate.
11021,"In a similar manner, the solution for a needle can be obtained by letting the ellipsoid become infinitely prolate."
11022,"However, it must be stressed that the only direct methods of general applicability are the numerical techniques."
11023,Boundary-value problems can also be solved by measurements of a physical analog.
11024,"Laplace’s equation arises in many different physical situations: in steady-state heat flow, in irrotational fluid flow, in current flow in an extended medium, and in the deflection of an elastic membrane."
11025,It is frequently possible to set up a physical model which is analogous to an electrical problem which we wish to solve.
11026,"By the measurement of a suitable analogous quantity on the model, the solution to the problem of interest can be determined."
11027,An example of the analog technique is the use of the electrolytic tank for the solution of two-dimensional problems in electrostatics.
11028,This works because the differential equation for the potential in a uniform conducting medium is the same as it is for a vacuum.
11029,"There are many physical situations in which the variations of the physical fields in one direction are zero, or can be neglected in comparison with the variations in the other two directions."
11030,Such problems are called two-dimensional; the field depends on two coordinates only.
11031,"There is, in fact, a very powerful indirect mathematical technique which depends on a theorem from the mathematics of functions of a complex variable, and which we will now describe."
11032,Now we come to a miraculous mathematical theorem which is so delightful that we shall leave a proof of it for one of your courses in mathematics.
11033,"(We should not reveal all the mysteries of mathematics, or that subject matter would become too dull.)"
11034,It is this.
11035,Each function represents a possible electrostatic potential.
11036,We can write down as many solutions as we wish—by just making up functions—then we just have to find the problem that goes with each solution.
11037,"It may sound backwards, but it’s a possible approach."
11038,From it we get the two potential functions of (7.5) and (7.6).
11039,7–1.
11040,Such a set of equipotentials corresponds to the field at an inside right-angle corner of a conductor.
11041,If we have two electrodes shaped like those in Fig.
11042,7–1.
11043,"Whereas at points or protuberances the electric field tends to be high, it tends to be low in dents or hollows."
11044,"The solution we have found also corresponds to that for a hyperbola-shaped electrode near a right-angle corner, or for two hyperbolas at suitable potentials."
11045,You will notice that the field of Fig.
11046,7–1 has an interesting property.
11047,This fact is used to make devices (called quadrupole lenses) that are useful for focusing particle beams (see Section 29–7).
11048,"The desired field is usually obtained by using four hyperbola shaped electrodes, as shown in Fig."
11049,7–3.
11050,For the electric field lines in Fig.
11051,"7–3, we have simply copied from Fig."
11052,We have a bonus!
11053,"And you will remember that we have solved either of two problems, depending on which set of curves we call the equipotentials."
11054,"(7.12), are plotted in Fig."
11055,7–4.
11056,"Again, there are many possible situations that could be described by these fields."
11057,One of the most interesting is the field near the edge of a thin plate.
11058,The physical situation is shown in Fig.
11059,7–5.
11060,"We will not pursue this subject further in this course, but should emphasize that although the complex variable technique is often powerful, it is limited to two-dimensional problems; and also, it is an indirect method."
11061,"We consider now some physical situations in which the field is determined neither by fixed charges nor by charges on conducting surfaces, but by a combination of two physical phenomena."
11062,"In other words, the field will be governed simultaneously by two sets of equations: (1) the equations from electrostatics relating electric fields to charge distribution, and (2) an equation from another part of physics that determines the positions or motions of the charges in the presence of the field."
11063,The first example that we will discuss is a dynamic one in which the motion of the charges is governed by Newton’s laws.
11064,"A simple example of such a situation occurs in a plasma, which is an ionized gas consisting of ions and free electrons distributed over a region in space."
11065,The ionosphere—an upper layer of the atmosphere—is an example of such a plasma.
11066,"The ultraviolet rays from the sun knock electrons off the molecules of the air, creating free electrons and ions."
11067,"In such a plasma the positive ions are very much heavier than the electrons, so we may neglect the ionic motion, in comparison to that of the electrons."
11068,"Assuming the molecules are singly ionized, this must also be the density of positive ions, since the plasma is electrically neutral (when undisturbed)."
11069,Now we suppose that the electrons are somehow moved from equilibrium and ask what happens.
11070,"If the density of the electrons in one region is increased, they will repel each other and tend to return to their equilibrium positions."
11071,"As the electrons move toward their original positions they pick up kinetic energy, and instead of coming to rest in their equilibrium configuration, they overshoot the mark."
11072,They will oscillate back and forth.
11073,"The situation is similar to what occurs in sound waves, in which the restoring force is the gas pressure."
11074,"In a plasma, the restoring force is the electrical force on the electrons."
11075,"Since the electrons have been displaced, their density will, in general, be changed."
11076,The change in density is easily calculated.
11077,Referring to Fig.
11078,This leads to a harmonic oscillation of the electrons.
11079,It is a characteristic number of the plasma.
11080,"The plasma electrons behave like a resonant system, such as those we described in Chapter 23 of Vol."
11081,I.
11082,This natural resonance of a plasma has some interesting effects.
11083,"For example, if one tries to propagate a radiowave through the ionosphere, one finds that it can penetrate only if its frequency is higher than the plasma frequency."
11084,Otherwise the signal is reflected back.
11085,We must use high frequencies if we wish to communicate with a satellite in space.
11086,"On the other hand, if we wish to communicate with a radio station beyond the horizon, we must use frequencies lower than the plasma frequency, so that the signal will be reflected back to the earth."
11087,Another interesting example of plasma oscillations occurs in metals.
11088,"In a metal we have a contained plasma of positive ions, and free electrons."
11089,But it should still be possible to observe the electron oscillations.
11090,This does indeed happen.
11091,It was first observed experimentally in 1936 that electrons with energies of a few hundred to a few thousand electron volts lost energy in jumps when scattering from or going through a thin metal foil.
11092,The effect was not understood until 1953 when Bohm and Pines1 showed that the observations could be explained in terms of quantum excitations of the plasma oscillations in the metal.
11093,We turn to another phenomenon in which the locations of charges are governed by a potential that arises in part from the same charges.
11094,The resulting effects influence in an important way the behavior of colloids.
11095,"A colloid consists of a suspension in water of small charged particles which, though microscopic, from an atomic point of view are still very large."
11096,"If the colloidal particles were not charged, they would tend to coagulate into large lumps; but because of their charge, they repel each other and remain in suspension."
11097,"Now if there is also some salt dissolved in the water, it will be dissociated into positive and negative ions."
11098,(Such a solution of ions is called an electrolyte.)
11099,The negative ions are attracted to the colloid particles (assuming their charge is positive) and the positive ions are repelled.
11100,We will determine how the ions which surround such a colloidal particle are distributed in space.
11101,"To keep the ideas simple, we will again solve only a one-dimensional case."
11102,If we think of a colloidal particle as a sphere having a very large radius—on an atomic scale!—we can then treat a small part of its surface as a plane.
11103,"(Whenever one is trying to understand a new phenomenon it is a good idea to take a somewhat oversimplified model; then, having understood the problem with that model, one is better able to proceed to tackle the more exact calculation.)"
11104,This we can determine by the principles of statistical mechanics.
11105,"According to statistical mechanics (see Chapter 40, Vol."
11106,"We assume that the ions carry one electronic charge, positive or negative."
11107,The general solution of Eq.
11108,7–7.
11109,We have said that the colloidal particles are kept apart by their electrical repulsion.
11110,But now we see that the field a little way from the surface of a particle is reduced by the ion sheath that collects around it.
11111,"If the sheaths get thin enough, the particles have a good chance of knocking against each other."
11112,"They will then stick, and the colloid will coagulate and precipitate out of the liquid."
11113,"From our analysis, we understand why adding enough salt to a colloid should cause it to precipitate out."
11114,The process is called “salting out a colloid.”
11115,Another interesting example is the effect that a salt solution has on protein molecules.
11116,"A protein molecule is a long, complicated, and flexible chain of amino acids."
11117,"The molecule has various charges on it, and it sometimes happens that there is a net charge, say negative, which is distributed along the chain."
11118,"Because of mutual repulsion of the negative charges, the protein chain is kept stretched out."
11119,"Also, if there are other similar chain molecules present in the solution, they will be kept apart by the same repulsive effects."
11120,"We can, therefore, have a suspension of chain molecules in a liquid."
11121,But if we add salt to the liquid we change the properties of the suspension.
11122,"As salt is added to the solution, decreasing the Debye distance, the chain molecules can approach one another, and can also coil up."
11123,"If enough salt is added to the solution, the chain molecules will precipitate out of the solution."
11124,There are many chemical effects of this kind that can be understood in terms of electrical forces.
11125,"As our last example, we would like to describe another interesting property of electric fields."
11126,"It is one which is made use of in the design of electrical instruments, in the construction of vacuum tubes, and for other purposes."
11127,This is the character of the electric field near a grid of charged wires.
11128,"To make the problem as simple as possible, let us consider an array of parallel wires lying in a plane, the wires being infinitely long and with a uniform spacing between them."
11129,"If we look at the field a large distance above the plane of the wires, we see a constant electric field, just as though the charge were uniformly spread over a plane."
11130,"As we approach the grid of wires, the field begins to deviate from the uniform field we found at large distances from the grid."
11131,We would like to estimate how close to the grid we have to be in order to see appreciable variations in the potential.
11132,Figure 7–8 shows a rough sketch of the equipotentials at various distances from the grid.
11133,"The closer we get to the grid, the larger the variations."
11134,"As we travel parallel to the grid, we observe that the field fluctuates in a periodic manner."
11135,"Now we have seen (Chapter 50, Vol."
11136,I) that any periodic quantity can be expressed as a sum of sine waves (Fourier’s theorem).
11137,Let’s see if we can find a suitable harmonic function that satisfies our field equations.
11138,"If this is to be a valid potential, it must satisfy Laplace’s equation in the region above the wires (where there are no charges)."
11139,The other harmonics fall off even more rapidly as we move away from the grid.
11140,The method we have just developed can be used to explain why electrostatic shielding by means of a screen is often just as good as with a solid metal sheet.
11141,"Except within a distance from the screen a few times the spacing of the screen wires, the fields inside a closed screen are zero."
11142,We see why copper screen—lighter and cheaper than copper sheet—is often used to shield sensitive electrical equipment from external disturbing fields.
11143,"In the study of mechanics, one of the most interesting and useful discoveries was the law of the conservation of energy."
11144,The expressions for the kinetic and potential energies of a mechanical system helped us to discover connections between the states of a system at two different times without having to look into the details of what was occurring in between.
11145,We wish now to consider the energy of electrostatic systems.
11146,In electricity also the principle of the conservation of energy will be useful for discovering a number of interesting things.
11147,"The law of the energy of interaction in electrostatics is very simple; we have, in fact, already discussed it."
11148,"There is some energy in the system, because a certain amount of work was required to bring the charges together."
11149,We have already calculated the work done in bringing two charges together from a large distance.
11150,"It follows, therefore, that the total energy of a system of a number of charges is the sum of terms due to the mutual interaction of each pair of charges."
11151,"(8.3) is, of course, to be replaced by an integral."
11152,We shall concern ourselves with two aspects of this energy.
11153,One is the application of the concept of energy to electrostatic problems; the other is the evaluation of the energy in different ways.
11154,Sometimes it is easier to compute the work done for some special case than to evaluate the sum in Eq.
11155,"(8.3), or the corresponding integral."
11156,"As an example, let us calculate the energy required to assemble a sphere of charge with a uniform charge density."
11157,The energy is just the work done in gathering the charges together from infinity.
11158,Imagine that we assemble the sphere by building up a succession of thin spherical layers of infinitesimal thickness.
11159,8–2).
11160,We can also interpret Eq.
11161,We consider now the energy required to charge a condenser.
11162,How much work is done in charging the condenser?
11163,(8.7).
11164,We now consider applications of the idea of electrostatic energy.
11165,Consider the following questions: What is the force between the plates of a condenser?
11166,Or what is the torque about some axis of a charged conductor in the presence of another with opposite charge?
11167,Such questions are easily answered by using our result Eq.
11168,"(8.9) for electrostatic energy of a condenser, together with the principle of virtual work (Chapters 4, 13, and 14 of Vol."
11169,I).
11170,Let’s use this method for determining the force between the plates of a parallel-plate condenser.
11171,This work must be equal to the change in the electrostatic energy of the condenser.
11172,By Eq.
11173,"It is easy to see how the idea is extended to conductors of any shape, and for other components of the force."
11174,In Eq.
11175,"We could, in this way, find the torque on the movable plates in a variable condenser of the type shown in Fig."
11176,8–3.
11177,Let’s look at Eq.
11178,(8.17) a little more closely and see if we can tell how the force arises.
11179,But we have a surprising factor of one-half.
11180,"If we imagine that the charge at the surface of the plate occupies a thin layer, as indicated in Fig."
11181,That is why the factor one-half is in Eq.
11182,(8.18).
11183,"You should notice that in computing the virtual work we have assumed that the charge on the condenser was constant—that it was not electrically connected to other objects, and so the total charge could not change."
11184,Suppose we had imagined that the condenser was held at a constant potential difference as we made the virtual displacement.
11185,Surely the force between the condenser plates doesn’t reverse in sign as we disconnect it from its charging source.
11186,"Also, we know that two plates with opposite electrical charges must attract."
11187,The principle of virtual work has been incorrectly applied in the second case—we have not taken into account the virtual work done on the charging source.
11188,We now consider an application of the concept of electrostatic energy in atomic physics.
11189,"We cannot easily measure the forces between atoms, but we are often interested in the energy differences between one atomic arrangement and another, as, for example, the energy of a chemical change."
11190,"Since atomic forces are basically electrical, chemical energies are in large part just electrostatic energies."
11191,"Let’s consider, for example, the electrostatic energy of an ionic lattice."
11192,An ionic crystal like NaCl consists of positive and negative ions which can be thought of as rigid spheres.
11193,They attract electrically until they begin to touch; then there is a repulsive force which goes up very rapidly if we try to push them closer together.
11194,"For our first approximation, therefore, we imagine a set of rigid spheres that represent the atoms in a salt crystal."
11195,The structure of the lattice has been determined by x-ray diffraction.
11196,It is a cubic lattice—like a three-dimensional checkerboard.
11197,Figure 8–5 shows a cross-sectional view.
11198,"If our picture of this system is correct, we should be able to check it by asking the following question: How much energy will it take to pull all these ions apart—that is, to separate the crystal completely into ions?"
11199,This energy should be equal to the heat of vaporization of NaCl plus the energy required to dissociate the molecules into ions.
11200,Can we obtain this chemical energy theoretically by computing how much work it would take to pull apart the crystal?
11201,"According to our theory, this work is the sum of the potential energies of all the pairs of ions."
11202,The easiest way to figure out this sum is to pick out a particular ion and compute its potential energy with each of the other ions.
11203,"That will give us twice the energy per ion, because the energy belongs to the pairs of charges."
11204,"If we want the energy to be associated with one particular ion, we should take half the sum."
11205,"But we really want the energy per molecule, which contains two ions, so that the sum we compute will give directly the energy per molecule."
11206,(We are considering monovalent ions.)
11207,But it is still a long way from the infinite sum of terms we need.
11208,Let’s begin by summing all the terms from the ions along a straight line.
11209,Considering that the ion marked Na in Fig.
11210,"8–5 is our special ion, we shall consider first those ions on a horizontal line with it."
11211,Now consider the next adjacent line of ions above.
11212,"Then there are the four lines which are the nearest lines on diagonals, and on and on."
11213,It shows that our idea that the whole lattice is held together by electrical Coulomb forces is fundamentally correct.
11214,This is the first time that we have obtained a specific property of a macroscopic substance from a knowledge of atomic physics.
11215,We will do much more later.
11216,The subject that tries to understand the behavior of bulk matter in terms of the laws of atomic behavior is called solid-state physics.
11217,Now what about the error in our calculation?
11218,Why is it not exactly right?
11219,It is because of the repulsion between the ions at close distances.
11220,"They are not perfectly rigid spheres, so when they are close together they are partly squashed."
11221,"They are not very soft, so they squash only a little bit."
11222,"Some energy, however, is used in deforming them, and when the ions are pulled apart this energy is released."
11223,The actual energy needed to pull the ions apart is a little less than the energy that we calculated; the repulsion helps in overcoming the electrostatic attraction.
11224,Is there any way we can make an allowance for this contribution?
11225,We could if we knew the law of the repulsive force.
11226,"We are not ready to analyze the details of this repulsive mechanism, but we can get some idea of its characteristics from some large-scale measurements."
11227,"From a measurement of the compressibility of the whole crystal, it is possible to obtain a quantitative idea of the law of repulsion between the ions and therefore of its contribution to the energy."
11228,There is one more thing we haven’t taken into account: we have made no allowance for the kinetic energy of the crystal vibrations.
11229,"If a correction is made for this effect, very good agreement with the experimental number is obtained."
11230,The ideas are then correct; the major contribution to the energy of a crystal like NaCl is electrostatic.
11231,"We will now take up another example of electrostatic energy in atomic physics, the electrical energy of atomic nuclei."
11232,Before we do this we will have to discuss some properties of the main forces (called nuclear forces) that hold the protons and neutrons together in a nucleus.
11233,"In the early days of the discovery of nuclei—and of the neutrons and protons that make them up—it was hoped that the law of the strong, nonelectrical part of the force between, say, a proton and another proton would have some simple law, like the inverse square law of electricity."
11234,"For once one had determined this law of force, and the corresponding ones between a proton and a neutron, and a neutron and a neutron, it would be possible to describe theoretically the complete behavior of these particles in nuclei."
11235,"Therefore a big program was started for the study of the scattering of protons, in the hope of finding the law of force between them; but after thirty years of effort, nothing simple has emerged."
11236,"A considerable knowledge of the force between proton and proton has been accumulated, but we find that the force is as complicated as it can possibly be."
11237,What we mean by “as complicated as it can be” is that the force depends on as many things as it possibly can.
11238,"First, the force is not a simple function of the distance between the two protons."
11239,"At large distances there is an attraction, but at closer distances there is a repulsion."
11240,"The distance dependence is a complicated function, still imperfectly known."
11241,"Second, the force depends on the orientation of the protons’ spin."
11242,"The protons have a spin, and any two interacting protons may be spinning with their angular momenta in the same direction or in opposite directions."
11243,"And the force is different when the spins are parallel from what it is when they are antiparallel, as in (a) and (b) of Fig."
11244,8–6.
11245,The difference is quite large; it is not a small effect.
11246,"Third, the force is considerably different when the separation of the two protons is in the direction parallel to their spins, as in (c) and (d) of Fig."
11247,"8–6, than it is when the separation is in a direction perpendicular to the spins, as in (a) and (b)."
11248,"Fourth, the force depends, as it does in magnetism, on the velocity of the protons, only much more strongly than in magnetism."
11249,And this velocity-dependent force is not a relativistic effect; it is strong even at speeds much less than the speed of light.
11250,"Furthermore, this part of the force depends on other things besides the magnitude of the velocity."
11251,"For instance, when a proton is moving near another proton, the force is different when the orbital motion has the same direction of rotation as the spin, as in (e) of Fig."
11252,"8–6, than when it has the opposite direction of rotation, as in (f)."
11253,This is called the “spin orbit” part of the force.
11254,The force between a proton and a neutron and between a neutron and a neutron are also equally complicated.
11255,"To this day we do not know the machinery behind these forces—that is to say, any simple way of understanding them."
11256,"There is, however, one important way in which the nucleon forces are simpler than they could be."
11257,"That is that the nuclear force between two neutrons is the same as the force between a proton and a neutron, which is the same as the force between two protons!"
11258,"If, in any nuclear situation, we replace a proton by a neutron (or vice versa), the nuclear interactions are not changed."
11259,This fact is nicely illustrated by the locations of the energy levels in similar nuclei.
11260,In the nucleus the eleven particles interact with one another in a most complicated dance.
11261,"Now, there is one configuration of all the possible interactions which has the lowest possible energy; this is the normal state of the nucleus, and is called the ground state."
11262,"If the nucleus is disturbed (for example, by being struck by a high-energy proton or other particle) it can be put into any number of other configurations, called excited states, each of which will have a characteristic energy that is higher than that of the ground state."
11263,"In nuclear physics research, such as is carried on with Van de Graaff generators (for example, in Caltech’s Kellogg and Sloan Laboratories), the energies and other properties of these excited states are determined by experiment."
11264,8–7.
11265,The lowest horizontal line represents the ground state.
11266,"The study of nuclear physics attempts to find an explanation for this rather complicated pattern of energies; there is as yet, however, no complete general theory of such nuclear energy levels."
11267,8–7.
11268,(The broken lines indicate levels for which the experimental information is questionable.)
11269,Looking at Fig.
11270,"8–7, we see a striking similarity between the pattern of the energy levels in the two nuclei."
11271,And so on.
11272,"After about the tenth level, the correspondence seems to become lost, but can still be seen if the levels are labeled with their other defining characteristics—for instance, their angular momentum and what they do to lose their extra energy."
11273,It must reveal some physical law.
11274,"It shows, in fact, that even in the complicated situation in a nucleus, replacing a neutron by a proton makes very little change."
11275,This can mean only that the neutron-neutron and proton-proton forces must be nearly identical.
11276,Only then would we expect the nuclear configurations with five protons and six neutrons to be the same as with six protons and five neutrons.
11277,Notice that the properties of these two nuclei tell us nothing about the neutron-proton force; there are the same number of neutron-proton combinations in both nuclei.
11278,"So we can conclude that the p-p, n-n, and p-n forces are identical in all their complexities."
11279,There is an unexpected principle in the laws of nuclear forces.
11280,"Even though the force between each pair of nuclear particles is very complicated, the force between the three possible different pairs is the same."
11281,But there are some small differences.
11282,All the other levels are also higher in absolute energy by this same amount.
11283,So the forces are not exactly equal.
11284,"But we know very well that the complete forces are not exactly equal; there is an electrical force between two protons because each has a positive charge, while between two neutrons there is no such electrical force."
11285,Perhaps even the remaining minor differences in the levels are caused by electrical effects?
11286,"Since the nuclear forces are so much stronger than the electrical force, electrical effects would have only a small perturbing effect on the energies of the levels."
11287,"In order to check this idea, or rather to find out what the consequences of this idea are, we first consider the difference in the ground-state energies of the two nuclei."
11288,"If we consider that a nucleus is like a sphere with uniform charge density, we would expect the electrostatic energy (from Eq."
11289,"With such a small number of protons, however, Eq."
11290,(8.22) is not quite correct.
11291,"If we compute the electrical energy between all pairs of protons, considered as points which we assume to be nearly uniformly distributed throughout the sphere, we find that in Eq."
11292,"But let’s do the opposite; let’s instead use the observed energy difference to compute the radius, assuming that the energy difference is all electrostatic in origin."
11293,"That is, however, not quite right."
11294,Using this energy in Eq.
11295,Does this number have any meaning?
11296,"To see whether it does, we should compare it with some other determination of the radius of these nuclei."
11297,"For example, we can make another measurement of the radius of a nucleus by seeing how it scatters fast particles."
11298,"From such measurements it has been found, in fact, that the density of matter in all nuclei is nearly the same, i.e., their volumes are proportional to the number of particles they contain."
11299,).
11300,The reason for the discrepancy is probably the following.
11301,"If this is so, we should have taken a different electrostatic energy for the additional proton."
11302,We can draw two conclusions from this agreement.
11303,"The other is that we have verified the remarkable coincidence that the nonelectrical part of the forces between proton and proton, neutron and neutron, and proton and neutron are all equal."
11304,We now consider other methods of calculating electrostatic energy.
11305,They can all be derived from the basic relation Eq.
11306,"(8.3), the sum, over all pairs of charges, of the mutual energies of each charge-pair."
11307,First we wish to write an expression for the energy of a charge distribution.
11308,Then Eq.
11309,(There is no convenient way of writing an integral that keeps track of the pairs so that each pair is counted only once.)
11310,This equation can be interpreted as follows.
11311,It is still required because we are counting energies twice.
11312,The mutual energies of two charges is the charge of one times the potential at it due to the other.
11313,"Or, it can be taken as the second charge times the potential at it from the first."
11314,An interesting question is: Where is the electrostatic energy located?
11315,One might also ask: Who cares?
11316,What is the meaning of such a question?
11317,"If there is a pair of interacting charges, the combination has a certain energy."
11318,"Do we need to say that the energy is located at one of the charges or the other, or at both, or in between?"
11319,These questions may not make sense because we really know only that the total energy is conserved.
11320,The idea that the energy is located somewhere is not necessary.
11321,"Yet suppose that it did make sense to say, in general, that energy is located at a certain place, as it does for heat energy."
11322,"We might then extend our principle of the conservation of energy with the idea that if the energy in a given volume changes, we should be able to account for the change by the flow of energy into or out of that volume."
11323,"You realize that our early statement of the principle of the conservation of energy is still perfectly all right if some energy disappears at one place and appears somewhere else far away without anything passing (that is, without any special phenomena occurring) in the space between."
11324,"We are, therefore, now discussing an extension of the idea of the conservation of energy."
11325,We might call it a principle of the local conservation of energy.
11326,Such a principle would say that the energy in any given volume changes only by the amount that flows into or out of the volume.
11327,It is indeed possible that energy is conserved locally in such a way.
11328,"If it is, we would have a much more detailed law than the simple statement of the conservation of total energy."
11329,It does turn out that in nature energy is conserved locally.
11330,We can find formulas for where the energy is located and how it travels from place to place.
11331,There is also a physical reason why it is imperative that we be able to say where energy is located.
11332,"According to the theory of gravitation, all mass is a source of gravitational attraction."
11333,"All energy is, therefore, a source of gravitational force."
11334,"If we could not locate the energy, we could not locate all the mass."
11335,We would not be able to say where the sources of the gravitational field are located.
11336,The theory of gravitation would be incomplete.
11337,If we restrict ourselves to electrostatics there is really no way to tell where the energy is located.
11338,"The complete Maxwell equations of electrodynamics give us much more information (although even then the answer is, strictly speaking, not unique.)"
11339,We will therefore discuss this question in detail again in a later chapter.
11340,We will give you now only the result for the particular case of electrostatics.
11341,"The energy is located in space, where the electric field is."
11342,This seems reasonable because we know that when charges are accelerated they radiate electric fields.
11343,"We would like to say that when light or radiowaves travel from one point to another, they carry their energy with them."
11344,But there are no charges in the waves.
11345,So we would like to locate the energy where the electromagnetic field is and not at the charges from which it came.
11346,"We thus describe the energy, not in terms of the charges, but in terms of the fields they produce."
11347,"We can, in fact, show that Eq."
11348,8–8.
11349,To show that Eq.
11350,"(8.30) is consistent with our laws of electrostatics, we begin by introducing into Eq."
11351,"We evaluate the surface integral in the case that the surface goes to infinity (so the volume integrals become integrals over all space), supposing that all the charges are located within some finite distance."
11352,"Our new relation, Eq."
11353,"Equation (8.35) says that there is an infinite amount of energy in the field of a point charge, although we began with the idea that there was energy only between point charges."
11354,In our original energy formula for a collection of point charges (Eq.
11355,"8.3), we did not include any interaction energy of a charge with itself."
11356,What has happened is that when we went over to a continuous distribution of charge in Eq.
11357,"(8.27), we counted the energy of interaction of every infinitesimal charge with all other infinitesimal charges."
11358,The same account is included in Eq.
11359,"(8.35), so when we apply it to a finite point charge, we are including the energy it would take to assemble that charge from infinitesimal parts."
11360,"You will notice, in fact, that we would also get the result in Eq."
11361,(8.36) if we used our expression (8.11) for the energy of a charged sphere and let the radius tend toward zero.
11362,We must conclude that the idea of locating the energy in the field is inconsistent with the assumption of the existence of point charges.
11363,"One way out of the difficulty would be to say that elementary charges, such as an electron, are not points but are really small distributions of charge."
11364,"Alternatively, we could say that there is something wrong in our theory of electricity at very small distances, or with the idea of the local conservation of energy."
11365,There are difficulties with either point of view.
11366,These difficulties have never been overcome; they exist to this day.
11367,"Sometime later, when we have discussed some additional ideas, such as the momentum in an electromagnetic field, we will give a more complete account of these fundamental difficulties in our understanding of nature."
11368,The sign of the field corresponds to a negative charge on the earth’s surface.
11369,We will answer the second question first.
11370,Your body is a relatively good conductor.
11371,"If you are in contact with the ground, you and the ground will tend to make one equipotential surface."
11372,"Ordinarily, the equipotentials are parallel to the surface, as shown in Fig."
11373,"9–1(a), but when you are there, the equipotentials are distorted, and the field looks somewhat as shown in Fig."
11374,9–1(b).
11375,So you still have very nearly zero potential difference between your head and your feet.
11376,"There are charges that come from the earth to your head, changing the field."
11377,"Some of them may be discharged by ions collected from the air, but the current of these is very small because air is a poor conductor."
11378,How can we measure such a field if the field is changed by putting something there?
11379,There are several ways.
11380,One way is to place an insulated conductor at some distance above the ground and leave it there until it is at the same potential as the air.
11381,"If we leave it long enough, the very small conductivity in the air will let the charges leak off (or onto) the conductor until it comes to the potential at its level."
11382,"Then we can bring it back to the ground, and measure the shift of its potential as we do so."
11383,A faster way is to let the conductor be a bucket of water with a small leak.
11384,"As the water drops out, it carries away any excess charges and the bucket will approach the same potential as the air."
11385,"(The charges, as you know, reside on the surface, and as the drops come off “pieces of surface” break off.)"
11386,We can measure the potential of the bucket with an electrometer.
11387,There is another way to directly measure the potential gradient.
11388,"If we place a flat metal plate at the earth’s surface and ground it, negative charges appear on it (Fig."
11389,9–2a).
11390,"Having suggested how we can measure the electric field in the atmosphere, we now continue our description of it."
11391,"Measurements show, first of all, that the field continues to exist, but gets weaker, as one goes up to high altitudes."
11392,"Another thing that can be measured, in addition to the potential gradient, is the current in the atmosphere."
11393,"The air is evidently not a perfect insulator, and because of this conductivity, a small current—caused by the electric field we have just been describing—passes from the sky down to the earth."
11394,Why does the atmosphere have conductivity?
11395,"Here and there among the air molecules there is an ion—a molecule of oxygen, say, which has acquired an extra electron, or perhaps lost one."
11396,These ions do not stay as single molecules; because of their electric field they usually accumulate a few other molecules around them.
11397,"Each ion then becomes a little lump which, along with other lumps, drifts in the field—moving slowly upward or downward—making the observed current."
11398,Where do the ions come from?
11399,It was first guessed that the ions were produced by the radioactivity of the earth.
11400,(It was known that the radiation from radioactive materials would make air conducting by ionizing the air molecules.)
11401,"This would imply, of course, that if we were to go to higher altitudes, we should find less ionization, because the radioactivity is all in the dirt on the ground—in the traces of radium, uranium, potassium, etc."
11402,"To test this theory, some physicists carried an experiment up in balloons to measure the ionization of the air (Hess, in 1912) and discovered that the opposite was true—the ionization per unit volume increased with altitude!"
11403,(The apparatus was like that of Fig.
11404,9–3.
11405,"Due to the conductivity of the air, the plates slowly discharged; the rate of discharge was measured with the electrometer.)"
11406,This was a most mysterious result—the most dramatic finding in the entire history of atmospheric electricity.
11407,"It was so dramatic, in fact, that it required a branching off of an entirely new subject—cosmic rays."
11408,Atmospheric electricity itself remained less dramatic.
11409,Ionization was evidently being produced by something from outside the earth; the investigation of this source led to the discovery of the cosmic rays.
11410,"We will not discuss the subject of cosmic rays now, except to say that they maintain the supply of ions."
11411,"Although the ions are being swept away all the time, new ones are being created by the cosmic-ray particles coming from the outside."
11412,"To be precise, we must say that besides the ions made of molecules, there are also other kinds of ions."
11413,"Tiny pieces of dirt, like extremely fine bits of dust, float in the air and become charged."
11414,"They are sometimes called “nuclei.” For example, when a wave breaks in the sea, little bits of spray are thrown into the air."
11415,"When one of these drops evaporates, it leaves an infinitesimal crystal of NaCl floating in the air."
11416,These tiny crystals can then pick up charges and become ions; they are called “large ions.”
11417,The small ions—those formed by cosmic rays—are the most mobile.
11418,The much bigger and heavier ions move much more slowly.
11419,"It turns out that if there are many “nuclei,” they will pick up the charges from the small ions."
11420,"Then, since the “large ions” move so slowly in a field, the total conductivity is reduced."
11421,"The conductivity of air, therefore, is quite variable, since it is very sensitive to the amount of “dirt” there is in it."
11422,There is much more of such dirt over land—where the winds can blow up dust or where man throws all kinds of pollution into the air—than there is over water.
11423,"It is not surprising that from day to day, from moment to moment, from place to place, the conductivity near the earth’s surface varies enormously."
11424,"The voltage gradient observed at any particular place on the earth’s surface also varies greatly because roughly the same current flows down from high altitudes in different places, and the varying conductivity near the earth results in a varying voltage gradient."
11425,The conductivity of the air due to the drifting of ions also increases rapidly with altitude—for two reasons.
11426,"First of all, the ionization from cosmic rays increases with altitude."
11427,"Secondly, as the density of air goes down, the mean free path of the ions increases, so that they can travel farther in the electric field before they have a collision—resulting in a rapid increase of conductivity as one goes up."
11428,"Although the electric current-density in the air is only a few micromicroamperes per square meter, there are very many square meters on the earth’s surface."
11429,"This current, of course, is “positive”—it carries plus charges to the earth."
11430,"With such a large current coming down, the negative charge on the earth should soon be discharged."
11431,"In fact, it should take only about half an hour to discharge the entire earth."
11432,But the atmospheric electric field has already lasted more than a half-hour since its discovery.
11433,How is it maintained?
11434,What maintains the voltage?
11435,And between what and the earth?
11436,There are many questions.
11437,"The earth is negative, and the potential in the air is positive."
11438,"If you go high enough, the conductivity is so great that horizontally there is no more chance for voltage variations."
11439,"The air, for the scale of times that we are talking about, becomes effectively a conductor."
11440,"This is not as high as what is called the “ionosphere,” in which there are very large numbers of ions produced by photoelectricity from the sun."
11441,Our picture of the situation is shown in Fig.
11442,9–4.
11443,The problem is: How is the positive charge maintained there?
11444,How is it pumped back?
11445,"Because if it comes down to the earth, it has to be pumped back somehow."
11446,That was one of the greatest puzzles of atmospheric electricity for quite a while.
11447,"Each piece of information we can get should give a clue or, at least, tell you something about it."
11448,"Here is an interesting phenomenon: If we measure the current (which is more stable than the potential gradient) over the sea, for instance, or in careful conditions, and average very carefully so that we get rid of the irregularities, we discover that there is still a daily variation."
11449,The average of many measurements over the oceans has a variation with time roughly as shown in Fig.
11450,9–5.
11451,"The strange part of the thing is that no matter where you measure the current—in the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, or the Arctic Ocean—it is at its peak value when the clocks in London say 7:00 p.m.!"
11452,All over the world the current is at its maximum at 7:00 p.m. London time and it is at a minimum at 4:00 a.m. London time.
11453,"In other words, it depends upon the absolute time on the earth, not upon the local time at the place of observation."
11454,"In one respect this is not mysterious; it checks with our idea that there is a very high conductivity laterally at the top, because that makes it impossible for the voltage difference from the ground to the top to vary locally."
11455,"Any potential variations should be worldwide, as indeed they are."
11456,We must next talk about the source of the large negative currents which must be flowing from the “top” to the surface of the earth to keep charging it up negatively.
11457,Where are the batteries that do this?
11458,The “battery” is shown in Fig.
11459,9–6.
11460,It is the thunderstorm and its lightning.
11461,It turns out that the bolts of lightning do not “discharge” the potential we have been talking about (as you might at first guess).
11462,Lightning storms carry negative charges to the earth.
11463,"When a lightning bolt strikes, nine times out of ten it brings down negative charges to the earth in large amounts."
11464,"Then take into account the geography of the earth—there are thunderstorms in the afternoon in Brazil, tropical thunderstorms in Africa, and so forth."
11465,"People have made estimates of how much lightning is striking world-wide at any time, and perhaps needless to say, their estimates more or less agree with the voltage difference measurements: the total amount of thunderstorm activity is highest on the whole earth at about 7:00 p.m. in London."
11466,"However, the thunderstorm estimates are very difficult to make and were made only after it was known that the variation should have occurred."
11467,These things are very difficult because we don’t have enough observations on the seas and over all parts of the world to know the number of thunderstorms accurately.
11468,"In order to understand how these batteries work, we will look at a thunderstorm in detail."
11469,What is going on inside a thunderstorm?
11470,We will describe this insofar as it is known.
11471,As we get into this marvelous phenomenon of real nature—instead of the idealized spheres of perfect conductors inside of other spheres that we can solve so neatly—we discover that we don’t know very much.
11472,Yet it is really quite exciting.
11473,"Anyone who has been in a thunderstorm has enjoyed it, or has been frightened, or at least has had some emotion."
11474,"And in those places in nature where we get an emotion, we find that there is generally a corresponding complexity and mystery about it."
11475,"It is not going to be possible to describe exactly how a thunderstorm works, because we do not yet know very much."
11476,But we will try to describe a little bit about what happens.
11477,"In the first place, an ordinary thunderstorm is made up of a number of “cells” fairly close together, but almost independent of each other."
11478,So it is best to analyze one cell at a time.
11479,By a “cell” we mean a region with a limited area in the horizontal direction in which all of the basic processes occur.
11480,"Usually there are several cells side by side, and in each one about the same thing is happening, although perhaps with a different timing."
11481,Figure 9–7 indicates in an idealized fashion what such a cell looks like in the early stage of the thunderstorm.
11482,"It turns out that in a certain place in the air, under certain conditions which we shall describe, there is a general rising of the air, with higher and higher velocities near the top."
11483,"As the warm, moist air at the bottom rises, it cools and the water vapor in it condenses."
11484,"In the figure the little stars indicate snow and the dots indicate rain, but because the updraft currents are great enough and the drops are small enough, the snow and rain do not come down at this stage."
11485,"This is the beginning stage, and not the real thunderstorm yet—in the sense that we don’t have anything happening at the ground."
11486,"At the same time that the warm air rises, there is an entrainment of air from the sides—an important point which was neglected for many years."
11487,"Thus it is not just the air from below which is rising, but also a certain amount of other air from the sides."
11488,Why does the air rise like this?
11489,"As you know, when you go up in altitude the air is colder."
11490,"The ground is heated by the sun, and the re-radiation of heat to the sky comes from water vapor high in the atmosphere; so at high altitudes the air is cold—very cold—whereas lower down it is warm."
11491,"You may say, “Then it’s very simple."
11492,"Warm air is lighter than cold; therefore the combination is mechanically unstable and the warm air rises.” Of course, if the temperature is different at different heights, the air is unstable thermodynamically."
11493,"Left to itself infinitely long, the air would all come to the same temperature."
11494,But it is not left to itself; the sun is always shining (during the day).
11495,"So the problem is indeed not one of thermodynamic equilibrium, but of mechanical equilibrium."
11496,Suppose we plot—as in Fig.
11497,9–8—the temperature of the air against height above the ground.
11498,"In ordinary circumstances we would get a decrease along a curve like the one labeled (a); as the height goes up, the temperature goes down."
11499,How can the atmosphere be stable?
11500,Why doesn’t the hot air below simply rise up into the cold air?
11501,"The answer is this: if the air were to go up, its pressure would go down, and if we consider a particular parcel of air going up, it would be expanding adiabatically."
11502,"(There would be no heat coming in or out because in the large dimensions considered here, there isn’t time for much heat flow.)"
11503,Thus the parcel of air would cool as it rises.
11504,Such an adiabatic process would give a temperature-height relationship like curve (b) in Fig.
11505,9–8.
11506,Any air which rose from below would be colder than the environment it goes into.
11507,"Thus there is no reason for the hot air below to rise; if it were to rise, it would cool to a lower temperature than the air already there, would be heavier than the air there, and would just want to come down again."
11508,"On a good, bright day with very little humidity there is a certain rate at which the temperature in the atmosphere falls, and this rate is, in general, lower than the “maximum stable gradient,” which is represented by curve (b)."
11509,The air is in stable mechanical equilibrium.
11510,"On the other hand, if we think of a parcel of air that contains a lot of water vapor being carried up into the air, its adiabatic cooling curve will be different."
11511,"As it expands and cools, the water vapor in it will condense, and the condensing water will liberate heat."
11512,"Moist air, therefore, does not cool nearly as much as dry air does."
11513,"So if air that is wetter than the average starts to rise, its temperature will follow a curve like (c) in Fig."
11514,9–8.
11515,"It will cool off somewhat, but will still be warmer than the surrounding air at the same level."
11516,"If we have a region of warm moist air and something starts it rising, it will always find itself lighter and warmer than the air around it and will continue to rise until it gets to enormous heights."
11517,This is the machinery that makes the air in the thunderstorm cell rise.
11518,For many years the thunderstorm cell was explained simply in this manner.
11519,But then measurements showed that the temperature of the cloud at different heights was not nearly as high as indicated by curve (c).
11520,"The reason is that as the moist air “bubble” goes up, it entrains air from the environment and is cooled off by it."
11521,"The temperature-versus-height curve looks more like curve (d), which is much closer to the original curve (a) than to curve (c)."
11522,"After the convection just described gets under way, the cross section of a thunderstorm cell looks like Fig."
11523,9–9.
11524,We have what is called a “mature” thunderstorm.
11525,"As the water vapor is carried up and condenses, it forms tiny drops which are rapidly cooled to temperatures below zero degrees."
11526,"They should freeze, but do not freeze immediately—they are “supercooled.” Water and other liquids will usually cool well below their freezing points before crystallizing if there are no “nuclei” present to start the crystallization process."
11527,"Only if there is some small piece of material present, like a tiny crystal of NaCl, will the water drop freeze into a little piece of ice."
11528,Then the equilibrium is such that the water drops evaporate and the ice crystals grow.
11529,Thus at a certain point there is a rapid disappearance of the water and a rapid buildup of ice.
11530,"Also, there may be direct collisions between the water drops and the ice—collisions in which the supercooled water becomes attached to the ice crystals, which causes it to suddenly crystallize."
11531,So at a certain point in the cloud expansion there is a rapid accumulation of large ice particles.
11532,"When the ice particles are heavy enough, they begin to fall through the rising air—they get too heavy to be supported any longer in the updraft."
11533,"As they come down, they draw a little air with them and start a downdraft."
11534,"And surprisingly enough, it is easy to see that once the downdraft is started, it will maintain itself."
11535,The air now drives itself down!
11536,Notice that the curve (d) in Fig.
11537,"9–8 for the actual distribution of temperature in the cloud is steeper than curve (c), which applies to wet air."
11538,"So if we have wet air falling, its temperature will drop with the slope of curve (c) and will go below the temperature of the environment if it gets down far enough, as indicated by curve (e) in the figure."
11539,"The moment it does that, it is denser than the environment and continues to fall rapidly."
11540,"You say, “That is perpetual motion."
11541,"First, you argue that the air should rise, and when you have it up there, you argue equally well that the air should fall.” But it isn’t perpetual motion."
11542,"When the situation is unstable and the warm air should rise, then clearly something has to replace the warm air."
11543,"It is equally true that cold air coming down would energetically replace the warm air, but you realize that what is coming down is not the original air."
11544,"The early arguments, that had a particular cloud without entrainment going up and then coming down, had some kind of a puzzle."
11545,They needed the rain to maintain the downdraft—an argument which is hard to believe.
11546,"As soon as you realize that there is a lot of original air mixed in with the rising air, the thermodynamic argument shows that there can be a descent of the cold air which was originally at some great height."
11547,This explains the picture of the active thunderstorm sketched in Fig.
11548,9–9.
11549,"As the air comes down, rain begins to come out of the bottom of the thunderstorm."
11550,"In addition, the relatively cold air spreads out when it arrives at the earth’s surface."
11551,So just before the rain comes there is a certain little cold wind that gives us a forewarning of the coming storm.
11552,"In the storm itself there are rapid and irregular gusts of air, there is an enormous turbulence in the cloud, and so on."
11553,"But basically we have an updraft, then a downdraft—in general, a very complicated process."
11554,"The moment at which precipitation starts is the same moment that the large downdraft begins and is the same moment, in fact, when the electrical phenomena arise."
11555,"Before we describe lightning, however, we can finish the story by looking at what happens to the thunderstorm cell after about one-half an hour to an hour."
11556,The cell looks as shown in Fig.
11557,9–10.
11558,The updraft stops because there is no longer enough warm air to maintain it.
11559,"The downward precipitation continues for a while, the last little bits of water come out, and things get quieter and quieter—although there are small ice crystals left way up in the air."
11560,"Because the winds at very great altitude are in different directions, the top of the cloud usually spreads into an anvil shape."
11561,The cell comes to the end of its life.
11562,We want now to discuss the most important aspect for our purposes—the development of the electrical charges.
11563,Experiments of various kinds—including flying airplanes through thunderstorms (the pilots who do this are brave men!
11564,)—tell us that the charge distribution in a thunderstorm cell is something like that shown in Fig.
11565,9–11.
11566,"The top of the thunderstorm has a positive charge, and the bottom a negative one—except for a small local region of positive charge in the bottom of the cloud, which has caused everybody a lot of worry."
11567,"No one seems to know why it is there, how important it is—whether it is a secondary effect of the positive rain coming down, or whether it is an essential part of the machinery."
11568,Things would be much simpler if it weren’t there.
11569,"Anyway, the predominantly negative charge at the bottom and the positive charge at the top have the correct sign for the battery needed to drive the earth negative."
11570,These large voltages break down the air and create giant arc discharges.
11571,When the breakdown occurs the negative charges at the bottom of the thunderstorm are carried down to the earth in the lightning strokes.
11572,Now we will describe in some detail the character of the lightning.
11573,"First of all, there are large voltage differences around, so that the air breaks down."
11574,"There are lightning strokes between one piece of a cloud and another piece of a cloud, or between one cloud and another cloud, or between a cloud and the earth."
11575,"This can be seen by measuring, far from a cloud, the electric field produced by the cloud’s dipole moment."
11576,"This means that any model made to explain how this storm generates its electricity must be one with plenty of juice—it must be a big, rapidly operating device."
11577,"Before we go further we shall consider something which is almost certainly completely irrelevant, but nevertheless interesting, because it does show the effect of an electric field on water drops."
11578,We say that it may be irrelevant because it relates to an experiment one can do in the laboratory with a stream of water to show the rather strong effects of the electric field on drops of water.
11579,In a thunderstorm there is no stream of water; there is a cloud of condensing ice and drops of water.
11580,So the question of the mechanisms at work in a thunderstorm is probably not at all related to what you can see in the simple experiment we will describe.
11581,"If you take a small nozzle connected to a water faucet and direct it upward at a steep angle, as in Fig."
11582,"9–12, the water will come out in a fine stream that eventually breaks up into a spray of fine drops."
11583,"If you now put an electric field across the stream at the nozzle (by bringing up a charged rod, for example), the form of the stream will change."
11584,With a weak electric field you will find that the stream breaks up into a smaller number of large-sized drops.
11585,"But if you apply a stronger field, the stream breaks up into many, many fine drops—smaller than before.1  With a weak electric field there is a tendency to inhibit the breakup of the stream into drops."
11586,"With a stronger field, however, there is an increase in the tendency to separate into drops."
11587,The explanation of these effects is probably the following.
11588,If we have the stream of water coming out of the nozzle and we put a small electric field across it one side of the water gets slightly positive and the other side gets slightly negative.
11589,"Then, when the stream breaks, the drops on one side may be positive, and those on the other side may be negative."
11590,They will attract each other and will have a tendency to stick together more than they would have before—the stream doesn’t break up as much.
11591,"On the other hand, if the field is stronger, the charge in each one of the drops gets much larger, and there is a tendency for the charge itself to help break up the drops through their own repulsion."
11592,"Each drop will break into many smaller ones, each carrying a charge, so that they are all repelled, and spread out so rapidly."
11593,"So as we increase the field, the stream becomes more finely separated."
11594,The only point we wish to make is that in certain circumstances electric fields can have considerable influence on the drops.
11595,"The exact machinery by which something happens in a thunderstorm is not at all known, and is not at all necessarily related to what we have just described."
11596,We have included it just so that you will appreciate the complexities that could come into play.
11597,"In fact, nobody has a theory applicable to clouds based on that idea."
11598,We would like to describe two theories which have been invented to account for the separation of the charges in a thunderstorm.
11599,All the theories involve the idea that there should be some charge on the precipitation particles and a different charge in the air.
11600,Then by the movement of the precipitation particles—the water or the ice—through the air there is a separation of electric charge.
11601,The only question is: How does the charging of the drops begin?
11602,One of the older theories is called the “breaking-drop” theory.
11603,"Somebody discovered that if you have a drop of water that breaks into two pieces in a windstream, there is positive charge on the water and negative charge in the air."
11604,"This breaking-drop theory has several disadvantages, among which the most serious is that the sign is wrong."
11605,"Second, in the large number of temperate-zone thunderstorms which do exhibit lightning, the precipitation effects at high altitudes are in ice, not in water."
11606,"From what we have just said, we note that if we could imagine some way for the charge to be different at the top and bottom of a drop and if we could also see some reason why drops in a high-speed airstream would break up into unequal pieces—a large one in the front and a smaller one in the back because of the motion through the air or something—we would have a theory."
11607,(Different from any known theory!)
11608,"Then the small drops would not fall through the air as fast as the big ones, because of the air resistance, and we would get a charge separation."
11609,"You see, it is possible to concoct all kinds of possibilities."
11610,"One of the more ingenious theories, which is more satisfactory in many respects than the breaking-drop theory, is due to C. T. R. Wilson."
11611,"We will describe it, as Wilson did, with reference to water drops, although the same phenomenon would also work with ice."
11612,"The drop will have an induced dipole moment—with the bottom of the drop positive and the top of the drop negative, as drawn in Fig."
11613,9–13.
11614,Now there are in the air the “nuclei” that we mentioned earlier—the large slow-moving ions.
11615,(The fast ions do not have an important effect here.)
11616,"Suppose that as a drop comes down, it approaches a large ion."
11617,"If the ion is positive, it is repelled by the positive bottom of the drop and is pushed away."
11618,So it does not become attached to the drop.
11619,"If the ion were to approach from the top, however, it might attach to the negative, top side."
11620,"But since the drop is falling through the air, there is an air drift relative to it, going upwards, which carries the ions away if their motion through the air is slow enough."
11621,Thus the positive ions cannot attach at the top either.
11622,"This would apply, you see, only to the large, slow-moving ions."
11623,The positive ions of this type will not attach themselves either to the front or the back of a falling drop.
11624,"On the other hand, as the large, slow, negative ions are approached by a drop, they will be attracted and will be caught."
11625,The drop will acquire negative charge—the sign of the charge having been determined by the original potential difference on the entire earth—and we get the right sign.
11626,"Negative charge will be brought down to the bottom part of the cloud by the drops, and the positively charged ions which are left behind will be blown to the top of the cloud by the various updraft currents."
11627,"The theory looks pretty good, and it at least gives the right sign."
11628,Also it doesn’t depend on having liquid drops.
11629,"We will see, when we learn about polarization in a dielectric, that pieces of ice will do the same thing."
11630,They also will develop positive and negative charges on their extremities when they are in an electric field.
11631,"There are, however, some problems even with this theory."
11632,"First of all, the total charge involved in a thunderstorm is very high."
11633,"After a short time, the supply of large ions would get used up."
11634,So Wilson and others have had to propose that there are additional sources of the large ions.
11635,"Once the charge separation starts, very large electric fields are developed, and in these large fields there may be places where the air will become ionized."
11636,"If there is a highly charged point, or any small object like a drop, it may concentrate the field enough to make a “brush discharge.” When there is a strong enough electric field—let us say it is positive—electrons will fall into the field and will pick up a lot of speed between collisions."
11637,"Their speed will be such that in hitting another atom they will tear electrons off at that atom, leaving positive charges behind."
11638,These new electrons also pick up speed and collide with more electrons.
11639,"So a kind of chain reaction or avalanche occurs, and there is a rapid accumulation of ions."
11640,"The positive charges are left near their original positions, so the net effect is to distribute the positive charge on the point into a region around the point."
11641,"Then, of course, there is no longer a strong field, and the process stops."
11642,This is the character of a brush discharge.
11643,"It is possible that the fields may become strong enough in the cloud to produce a little bit of brush discharge; there may also be other mechanisms, once the thing is started, to produce a large amount of ionization."
11644,But nobody knows exactly how it works.
11645,So the fundamental origin of lightning is really not thoroughly understood.
11646,We know it comes from the thunderstorms.
11647,"(And we know, of course, that thunder comes from the lightning—from the thermal energy released by the bolt.)"
11648,"At least we can understand, in part, the origin of atmospheric electricity."
11649,"Due to the air currents, ions, and water drops on ice particles in a thunderstorm, positive and negative charges are separated."
11650,The positive charges are carried upward to the top of the cloud (see Fig.
11651,"9–11), and the negative charges are dumped into the ground in lightning strokes."
11652,"The positive charges leave the top of the cloud, enter the high-altitude layers of more highly conducting air, and spread throughout the earth."
11653,"In regions of clear weather, the positive charges in this layer are slowly conducted to the earth by the ions in the air—ions formed by cosmic rays, by the sea, and by man’s activities."
11654,The atmosphere is a busy electrical machine!
11655,The first evidence of what happens in a lightning stroke was obtained in photographs taken with a camera held by hand and moved back and forth with the shutter open—while pointed toward a place where lightning was expected.
11656,The first photographs obtained this way showed clearly that lightning strokes are usually multiple discharges along the same path.
11657,The image made by each lens moves across the film—the picture is spread out in time.
11658,"If, for instance, the stroke repeats, there will be two images side by side."
11659,"By comparing the images of the two lenses, it is possible to work out the details of the time sequence of the flashes."
11660,Figure 9–14 shows a photograph taken with a “Boys” camera.
11661,We will now describe the lightning.
11662,"Again, we don’t understand exactly how it works."
11663,"We will give a qualitative description of what it looks like, but we won’t go into any details of why it does what it appears to do."
11664,We will describe only the ordinary case of the cloud with a negative bottom over flat country.
11665,"Its potential is much more negative than the earth underneath, so negative electrons will be accelerated toward the earth."
11666,What happens is the following.
11667,"It all starts with a thing called a “step leader,” which is not as bright as the stroke of lightning."
11668,On the photographs one can see a little bright spot at the beginning that starts from the cloud and moves downward very rapidly—at a sixth of the speed of light!
11669,"It pauses again and then goes another step, and so on."
11670,"It moves in a series of steps toward the ground, along a path like that shown in Fig."
11671,9–15.
11672,In the leader there are negative charges from the cloud; the whole column is full of negative charge.
11673,"Also, the air is becoming ionized by the rapidly moving charges that produce the leader, so the air becomes a conductor along the path traced out."
11674,"The moment the leader touches the ground, we have a conducting “wire” that runs all the way up to the cloud and is full of negative charge."
11675,"Now, at last, the negative charge of the cloud can simply escape and run out."
11676,"The electrons at the bottom of the leader are the first ones to realize this; they dump out, leaving positive charge behind that attracts more negative charge from higher up in the leader, which in its turn pours out, etc."
11677,So finally all the negative charge in a part of the cloud runs out along the column in a rapid and energetic way.
11678,"So the lightning stroke you see runs upwards from the ground, as indicated in Fig."
11679,9–16.
11680,"In fact, this main stroke—by far the brightest part—is called the return stroke."
11681,"It is what produces the very bright light, and the heat, which by causing a rapid expansion of the air makes the thunder clap."
11682,But we are still not finished.
11683,"After a time of, perhaps, a few hundredths of a second, when the return stroke has disappeared, another leader comes down."
11684,But this time there are no pauses.
11685,"It is called a “dart leader” this time, and it goes all the way down—from top to bottom in one swoop."
11686,"It goes full steam on exactly the old track, because there is enough debris there to make it the easiest route."
11687,The new leader is again full of negative charge.
11688,The moment it touches the ground—zing!—there is a return stroke going straight up along the path.
11689,"So you see the lightning strike again, and again, and again."
11690,Sometimes things get even more complicated.
11691,"For instance, after one of its pauses the leader may develop a branch by sending out two steps—both toward the ground but in somewhat different directions, as shown in Fig."
11692,9–15.
11693,What happens then depends on whether one branch reaches the ground definitely before the other.
11694,"If that does happen, the bright return stroke (of negative charge dumping into the ground) works its way up along the branch that touches the ground, and when it reaches and passes the branching point on its way up to the cloud, a bright stroke appears to go down the other branch."
11695,Why?
11696,Because negative charge is dumping out and that is what lights up the bolt.
11697,"This charge begins to move at the top of the secondary branch, emptying successive, longer pieces of the branch, so the bright lightning bolt appears to work its way down that branch, at the same time as it works up toward the cloud."
11698,"If, however, one of these extra leader branches happens to have reached the ground almost simultaneously with the original leader, it can sometimes happen that the dart leader of the second stroke will take the second branch."
11699,Then you will see the first main flash in one place and the second flash in another place.
11700,It is a variant of the original idea.
11701,"Also, our description is oversimplified for the region very near the ground."
11702,"When the step leader gets to within a hundred meters or so from the ground, there is evidence that a discharge rises from the ground to meet it."
11703,"Presumably, the field gets big enough for a brush-type discharge to occur."
11704,"If, for instance, there is a sharp object, like a building with a point at the top, then as the leader comes down nearby the fields are so large that a discharge starts from the sharp point and reaches up to the leader."
11705,The lightning tends to strike such a point.
11706,It has apparently been known for a long time that high objects are struck by lightning.
11707,"There is a quotation of Artabanus, the advisor to Xerxes, giving his master advice on a contemplated attack on the Greeks—during Xerxes’ campaign to bring the entire known world under the control of the Persians."
11708,"Artabanus said, “See how God with his lightning always smites the bigger animals and will not suffer them to wax insolent, while these of a lesser bulk chafe him not."
11709,"How likewise his bolts fall ever on the highest houses and tallest trees.”  And then he explains the reason: “So, plainly, doth he love to bring down everything that exalts itself.”"
11710,Do you think—now that you know a true account of lightning striking tall trees—that you have a greater wisdom in advising kings on military matters than did Artabanus 2400 years ago?
11711,Do not exalt yourself.
11712,You could only do it less poetically.
11713,Here we begin to discuss another of the peculiar properties of matter under the influence of the electric field.
11714,"In an earlier chapter we considered the behavior of conductors, in which the charges move freely in response to an electric field to such points that there is no field left inside a conductor."
11715,"Now we will discuss insulators, materials which do not conduct electricity."
11716,One might at first believe that there should be no effect whatsoever.
11717,"However, using a simple electroscope and a parallel-plate capacitor, Faraday discovered that this was not so."
11718,His experiments showed that the capacitance of such a capacitor is increased when an insulator is put between the plates.
11719,"The dielectric constant of a vacuum is, of course, unity."
11720,Our problem now is to explain why there is any electrical effect if the insulators are indeed insulators and do not conduct electricity.
11721,We begin with the experimental fact that the capacitance is increased and try to reason out what might be going on.
11722,"Consider a parallel-plate capacitor with some charges on the surfaces of the conductors, let us say negative charge on the top plate and positive charge on the bottom plate."
11723,"That means, of course, that the voltage is lower for the same charge."
11724,"But the voltage difference is the integral of the electric field across the capacitor; so we must conclude that inside the capacitor, the electric field is reduced even though the charges on the plates remain unchanged."
11725,Now how can that be?
11726,We have a law due to Gauss that tells us that the flux of the electric field is directly related to the enclosed charge.
11727,10–1.
11728,"Since the electric field is reduced with the dielectric present, we conclude that the net charge inside the surface must be lower than it would be without the material."
11729,"There is only one possible conclusion, and that is that there must be positive charges on the surface of the dielectric."
11730,"Since the field is reduced but is not zero, we would expect this positive charge to be smaller than the negative charge on the conductor."
11731,So the phenomena can be explained if we could understand in some way that when a dielectric material is placed in an electric field there is positive charge induced on one surface and negative charge induced on the other.
11732,We would expect that to happen for a conductor.
11733,10–2.
11734,"The electric field induces a positive charge on the upper surface and a negative charge on the lower surface, so there is no field inside the conductor."
11735,This gives us an obvious model for what happens with dielectrics—that inside the material there are many little sheets of conducting material.
11736,"The trouble with such a model is that it has a specific axis, the normal to the sheets, whereas most dielectrics have no such axis."
11737,"However, this difficulty can be eliminated if we assume that all insulating materials contain small conducting spheres separated from each other by insulation, as shown in Fig."
11738,10–3.
11739,The phenomenon of the dielectric constant is explained by the effect of the charges which would be induced on each sphere.
11740,This is one of the earliest physical models of dielectrics used to explain the phenomenon that Faraday observed.
11741,"More specifically, it was assumed that each of the atoms of a material was a perfect conductor, but insulated from the others."
11742,"This is not, however, the model that is used today."
11743,"If we follow the above analysis further, we discover that the idea of regions of perfect conductivity and insulation is not essential."
11744,"Each of the small spheres acts like a dipole, the moment of which is induced by the external field."
11745,The only thing that is essential to the understanding of dielectrics is that there are many little dipoles induced in the material.
11746,Whether the dipoles are induced because there are tiny conducting spheres or for any other reason is irrelevant.
11747,Why should a field induce a dipole moment in an atom if the atom is not a conducting sphere?
11748,"This subject will be discussed in much greater detail in the next chapter, which will be about the inner workings of dielectric materials."
11749,"However, we give here one example to illustrate a possible mechanism."
11750,"An atom has a positive charge on the nucleus, which is surrounded by negative electrons."
11751,"In an electric field, the nucleus will be attracted in one direction and the electrons in the other."
11752,"The orbits or wave patterns of the electrons (or whatever picture is used in quantum mechanics) will be distorted to some extent, as shown in Fig."
11753,10–4; the center of gravity of the negative charge will be displaced and will no longer coincide with the positive charge of the nucleus.
11754,We have already discussed such distributions of charge.
11755,"If we look from a distance, such a neutral configuration is equivalent, to a first approximation, to a little dipole."
11756,"It seems reasonable that if the field is not too enormous, the amount of induced dipole moment will be proportional to the field."
11757,"That is, a small field will displace the charges a little bit and a larger field will displace them further—and in proportion to the field—unless the displacement gets too large."
11758,"For the remainder of this chapter, it will be supposed that the dipole moment is exactly proportional to the field."
11759,"The constant of proportionality, which depends on the ease with which the electrons are displaced, will depend on the kinds of atoms in the material."
11760,"What actually determines how this constant of proportionality behaves, how accurately it is constant for very large fields, and what is going on inside different materials, we will discuss at a later time."
11761,"For the present, we will simply suppose that there exists a mechanism by which a dipole moment is induced which is proportional to the electric field."
11762,Now let us see what this model gives for the theory of a condenser with a dielectric.
11763,First consider a sheet of material in which there is a certain dipole moment per unit volume.
11764,Will there be on the average any charge density produced by this?
11765,"If the positive and negative charges being displaced relative to each other have the same average density, the fact that they are displaced does not produce any net charge inside the volume."
11766,As shown in Fig.
11767,"10–5, we will have a surface density of charge, which will be called the surface polarization charge."
11768,This charge can be calculated as follows.
11769,"The surface charge is, of course, positive on one surface and negative on the other."
11770,Now let us assume that our slab is the dielectric of a parallel-plate capacitor.
11771,"This is, of course, the charge that we put on when we charged the capacitor."
11772,10–1.
11773,"But here we are concerned with the field inside the dielectric which, if the dielectric nearly fills the gap, is the field over nearly the whole volume."
11774,Using Eq.
11775,Then Eq.
11776,The voltage between the plates is the integral of the electric field.
11777,We have explained the observed facts.
11778,"Our explanation, of course, is not complete until we have explained—as we will do later—how the atomic polarization comes about."
11779,"As mentioned earlier, if the polarization is not constant, we would expect in general to find a charge density in the volume, because more charge might come into one side of a small volume element than leaves it on the other."
11780,How can we find out how much charge is gained or lost from a small volume?
11781,First let’s compute how much charge moves across any imaginary surface when the material is polarized.
11782,"Of course, if the polarization is tangential to the surface, no charge moves across it."
11783,Compare Fig.
11784,10–6 with Fig.
11785,10–5.
11786,We see that Eq.
11787,"If we are thinking of an imagined surface element inside the dielectric, Eq."
11788,"(10.12) gives the charge moved across the surface but doesn’t result in a net surface charge, because there are equal and opposite contributions from the dielectric on the two sides of the surface."
11789,"The displacements of the charges can, however, result in a volume charge density."
11790,10–7).
11791,An equal excess charge of the opposite sign is left behind.
11792,We can see that it agrees with the result we got for the surface polarization charge or the dielectric in a parallel-plate capacitor.
11793,Using Eq.
11794,(10.15) with the Gaussian surface of Fig.
11795,"Just as we did for Gauss’ law of electrostatics, we can convert Eq."
11796,We emphasize that this is a perfectly real charge density; we call it “polarization charge” only to remind ourselves how it got there.
11797,Now let’s combine the above result with our theory of electrostatics.
11798,That is because it may not be the same everywhere.
11799,"In the form we have given, the equations apply to the general case where different dielectrics may be in different places in the field."
11800,Then the equations may be quite difficult to solve.
11801,There is a matter of some historical importance which should be mentioned here.
11802,When Eq.
11803,"Today we look upon these matters from another point of view, namely, that we have simpler equations in a vacuum, and if we exhibit in every case all the charges, whatever their origin, the equations are always correct."
11804,"If we separate some of the charges away for convenience, or because we do not want to discuss what is going on in detail, then we can, if we wish, write our equations in any other form that may be convenient."
11805,One more point should be emphasized.
11806,"But matter is extremely complicated, and such an equation is in fact not correct."
11807,"For some substances, the proportionality breaks down even with relatively small fields."
11808,"Therefore this kind of equation is a kind of approximation, like Hooke’s law."
11809,It cannot be a deep and fundamental equation.
11810,We will now prove some rather general theorems for electrostatics in situations where dielectrics are present.
11811,We have seen that the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is increased by a definite factor if it is filled with a dielectric.
11812,"We can show that this is true for a capacitor of any shape, provided the entire region in the neighborhood of the two conductors is filled with a uniform linear dielectric."
11813,"Since the voltage difference is a line integral of the field, the voltage is reduced by this same factor."
11814,"Since the charge on the electrodes of the capacitor has been taken the same in both cases, Eq."
11815,Let us now ask what the force would be between two charged conductors in a dielectric.
11816,We consider a liquid dielectric that is homogeneous everywhere.
11817,We have seen earlier that one way to obtain the force is to differentiate the energy with respect to the appropriate distance.
11818,One point should be emphasized.
11819,What we have said is true only if the dielectric is a liquid.
11820,"Any motion of conductors that are embedded in a solid dielectric changes the mechanical stress conditions of the dielectric and alters its electrical properties, as well as causing some mechanical energy change in the dielectric."
11821,Moving the conductors in a liquid does not change the liquid.
11822,The liquid moves to a new place but its electrical characteristics are not changed.
11823,"For one thing, it is not true in general; it is true only for a world filled with a liquid."
11824,"It is much better to start with Coulomb’s law for charges in a vacuum, which is always right (for stationary charges)."
11825,What does happen in a solid?
11826,"This is a very difficult problem which has not been solved, because it is, in a sense, indeterminate."
11827,"If you put charges inside a dielectric solid, there are many kinds of pressures and strains."
11828,"You cannot deal with virtual work without including also the mechanical energy required to compress the solid, and it is a difficult matter, generally speaking, to make a unique distinction between the electrical forces and the mechanical forces due to the solid material itself."
11829,"Fortunately, no one ever really needs to know the answer to the question proposed."
11830,"He may sometimes want to know how much strain there is going to be in a solid, and that can be worked out."
11831,But it is much more complicated than the simple result we got for liquids.
11832,A surprisingly complicated problem in the theory of dielectrics is the following: Why does a charged object pick up little pieces of dielectric?
11833,"If you comb your hair on a dry day, the comb readily picks up small scraps of paper."
11834,"If you thought casually about it, you probably assumed the comb had one charge on it and the paper had the opposite charge on it."
11835,But the paper is initially electrically neutral.
11836,"It hasn’t any net charge, but it is attracted anyway."
11837,"It is true that sometimes the paper will come up to the comb and then fly away, repelled immediately after it touches the comb."
11838,"The reason is, of course, that when the paper touches the comb, it picks up some negative charges and then the like charges repel."
11839,But that doesn’t answer the original question.
11840,Why did the paper come toward the comb in the first place?
11841,The answer has to do with the polarization of a dielectric when it is placed in an electric field.
11842,"There are polarization charges of both signs, which are attracted and repelled by the comb."
11843,"There is a net attraction, however, because the field nearer the comb is stronger than the field farther away—the comb is not an infinite sheet."
11844,Its charge is localized.
11845,A neutral piece of paper will not be attracted to either plate inside the parallel plates of a capacitor.
11846,The variation of the field is an essential part of the attraction mechanism.
11847,As illustrated in Fig.
11848,"10–8, a dielectric is always drawn from a region of weak field toward a region of stronger field."
11849,"In fact, one can prove that for small objects the force is proportional to the gradient of the square of the electric field."
11850,Why does it depend on the square of the field?
11851,"Because the induced polarization charges are proportional to the fields, and for given charges the forces are proportional to the field."
11852,"However, as we have just indicated, there will be a net force only if the square of the field is changing from point to point."
11853,So the force is proportional to the gradient of the square of the field.
11854,"The constant of proportionality involves, among other things, the dielectric constant of the object, and it also depends upon the size and shape of the object."
11855,There is a related problem in which the force on a dielectric can be worked out quite accurately.
11856,"If we have a parallel-plate capacitor with a dielectric slab only partially inserted, as shown in Fig."
11857,"10–9, there will be a force driving the sheet in."
11858,A detailed examination of the force is quite complicated; it is related to nonuniformities in the field near the edges of the dielectric and the plates.
11859,"However, if we do not look at the details, but merely use the principle of conservation of energy, we can easily calculate the force."
11860,We can find the force from the formula we derived earlier.
11861,The capacitance is the ratio of the total free charge on the plates to the voltage between the plates.
11862,We only wished to show that the theory of energy can often be used to avoid enormous complications in determining the forces on dielectric materials—as there would be in the present case.
11863,"Our discussion of the theory of dielectrics has dealt only with electrical phenomena, accepting the fact that the material has a polarization which is proportional to the electric field."
11864,Why there is such a proportionality is perhaps of greater interest to physics.
11865,"Once we understand the origin of the dielectric constants from an atomic point of view, we can use electrical measurements of the dielectric constants in varying circumstances to obtain detailed information about atomic or molecular structure."
11866,This aspect will be treated in part in the next chapter.
11867,In this chapter we are going to discuss why it is that materials are dielectric.
11868,We said in the last chapter that we could understand the properties of electrical systems with dielectrics once we appreciated that when an electric field is applied to a dielectric it induces a dipole moment in the atoms.
11869,We have already discussed how this equation is applied; now we have to discuss the mechanism by which polarization arises when there is an electric field inside a material.
11870,We begin with the simplest possible example—the polarization of gases.
11871,But even gases already have complications: there are two types.
11872,"The molecules of some gases, like oxygen, which has a symmetric pair of atoms in each molecule, have no inherent dipole moment."
11873,"But the molecules of others, like water vapor (which has a nonsymmetric arrangement of hydrogen and oxygen atoms) carry a permanent electric dipole moment."
11874,"As we pointed out in Chapter 6, there is in the water vapor molecule an average plus charge on the hydrogen atoms and a negative charge on the oxygen."
11875,"Since the center of gravity of the negative charge and the center of gravity of the positive charge do not coincide, the total charge distribution of the molecule has a dipole moment."
11876,Such a molecule is called a polar molecule.
11877,"In oxygen, because of the symmetry of the molecule, the centers of gravity of the positive and negative charges are the same, so it is a nonpolar molecule."
11878,"It does, however, become a dipole when placed in an electric field."
11879,The forms of the two types of molecules are sketched in Fig.
11880,11–1.
11881,We will first discuss the polarization of non polar molecules.
11882,"We can start with the simplest case of a monatomic gas (for instance, helium)."
11883,"When an atom of such a gas is in an electric field, the electrons are pulled one way by the field while the nucleus is pulled the other way, as shown in Fig."
11884,10–4.
11885,"Although the atoms are very stiff with respect to the electrical forces we can apply experimentally, there is a slight net displacement of the centers of charge, and a dipole moment is induced."
11886,"For small fields, the amount of displacement, and so also the dipole moment, is proportional to the electric field."
11887,The displacement of the electron distribution which produces this kind of induced dipole moment is called electronic polarization.
11888,We have already discussed the influence of an electric field on an atom in Chapter 31 of Vol.
11889,"I, when we were dealing with the theory of the index of refraction."
11890,"If you think about it for a moment, you will see that what we must do now is exactly the same as we did then."
11891,"But now we need worry only about fields that do not vary with time, while the index of refraction depended on time-varying fields."
11892,In Chapter 31 of Vol.
11893,It is a measure of how easy it is to induce a moment in an atom with an electric field.
11894,From Eq.
11895,"Our formula is, of course, only a very rough approximation, because in Eq."
11896,(11.2) we have taken a model which ignores the complications of quantum mechanics.
11897,"For example, we have assumed that an atom has only one resonant frequency, when it really has many."
11898,Let’s see if we can get the right order of magnitude for the dielectric constant of some substance.
11899,Suppose we try hydrogen.
11900,"We have once estimated (Chapter 38, Vol."
11901,"We should not expect any better, because the measurements were, of course, made with normal hydrogen gas, which has diatomic molecules, not single atoms."
11902,We should not be surprised if the polarization of the atoms in a molecule is not quite the same as that of the separate atoms.
11903,"The molecular effect, however, is not really that large."
11904,"In any case, it is clear that our model of a dielectric is fairly good."
11905,Another check on our theory is to try Eq.
11906,(11.7) on atoms which have a higher frequency of excitation.
11907,"So we have understood the dielectric constant of nonpolar gas, but only qualitatively, because we have not yet used a correct atomic theory of the motions of the atomic electrons."
11908,"With no electric field, the individual dipoles point in random directions, so the net moment per unit volume is zero."
11909,"But when an electric field is applied, two things happen: First, there is an extra dipole moment induced because of the forces on the electrons; this part gives just the same kind of electronic polarizability we found for a nonpolar molecule."
11910,"For very accurate work, this effect should, of course, be included, but we will neglect it for the moment."
11911,(It can always be added in at the end.)
11912,"Second, the electric field tends to line up the individual dipoles to produce a net moment per unit volume."
11913,"If all the dipoles in a gas were to line up, there would be a very large polarization, but that does not happen."
11914,At ordinary temperatures and electric fields the collisions of the molecules in their thermal motion keep them from lining up very much.
11915,"But there is some net alignment, and so some polarization (see Fig."
11916,11–2).
11917,The polarization that does occur can be computed by the methods of statistical mechanics we described in Chapter 40 of Vol.
11918,I.
11919,To use this method we need to know the energy of a dipole in an electric field.
11920,11–3.
11921,"As we would expect, the energy is lower when the dipoles are lined up with the field."
11922,We now find out how much lining up occurs by using the methods of statistical mechanics.
11923,We found in Chapter 40 of Vol.
11924,The same arguments would say that using Eq.
11925,We can evaluate the sum by integrating over the angular distribution.
11926,"Also, as we expect, the polarization depends inversely on the temperature, because at higher temperatures there is more disalignment by collisions."
11927,We should now try to see how well Eq.
11928,(11.20) agrees with experiment.
11929,Let’s look at the case of steam.
11930,In Fig.
11931,The dependence predicted by (11.21) is followed quite well.
11932,There is another characteristic of the dielectric constant of polar molecules—its variation with the frequency of the applied field.
11933,"Due to the moment of inertia of the molecules, it takes a certain amount of time for the heavy molecules to turn toward the direction of the field."
11934,"So if we apply frequencies in the high microwave region or above, the polar contribution to the dielectric constant begins to fall away because the molecules cannot follow."
11935,"In contrast to this, the electronic polarizability still remains the same up to optical frequencies, because of the smaller inertia in the electrons."
11936,We now turn to an interesting but complicated question—the problem of the dielectric constant in dense materials.
11937,Suppose that we take liquid helium or liquid argon or some other nonpolar material.
11938,We still expect electronic polarization.
11939,"The question is, what electric field acts on the individual atom?"
11940,Imagine that the liquid is put between the plates of a condenser.
11941,If the plates are charged they will produce an electric field in the liquid.
11942,"This true electric field varies very, very rapidly from point to point in the liquid."
11943,It is very high inside the atoms—particularly right next to the nucleus—and relatively small between the atoms.
11944,The potential difference between the plates is the line integral of this total field.
11945,(This is the field we were using in the last chapter.)
11946,We should think of this field as the average over a space containing many atoms.
11947,Now you might think that an “average” atom in an “average” location would feel this average field.
11948,"But it is not that simple, as we can show by considering what happens if we imagine different-shaped holes in a dielectric."
11949,"For instance, suppose that we cut a slot in a polarized dielectric, with the slot oriented parallel to the field, as shown in part (a) of Fig."
11950,11–5.
11951,The field inside the slot must give a contribution which just cancels the part from the field outside.
11952,11–5.
11953,"But nobody ever measures them that way anyway, so it was just one of those philosophical things."
11954,"For most liquids which are not too complicated in structure, we could expect that an atom finds itself, on the average, surrounded by the other atoms in what would be a good approximation to a spherical hole."
11955,"And so we should ask: “What would be the field in a spherical hole?” We can find out by noticing that if we imagine carving out a spherical hole in a uniformly polarized material, we are just removing a sphere of polarized material."
11956,(We must imagine that the polarization is “frozen in” before we cut out the hole.)
11957,"By superposition, however, the fields inside the dielectric, before the sphere was removed, is the sum of the fields from all charges outside the spherical volume plus the fields from the charges within the polarized sphere."
11958,11–6).
11959,The fields due to a uniformly polarized sphere are shown in Fig.
11960,11–7.
11961,"(11.6), then Eq."
11962,This is called the Clausius-Mossotti equation.
11963,Let’s compare Eq.
11964,(11.28) with some experimental results.
11965,(11.29).
11966,Now the density of the gas is easily worked out and the density of the liquid can be found in handbooks.
11967,"In Table 11–1 we give some experimental data on various materials (taken from the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics), together with the dielectric constants calculated from Eq."
11968,(11.28) in the way just described.
11969,"On the whole, the results show that Eq."
11970,(11.28) works very well.
11971,Our derivation of Eq.
11972,(11.28) is valid only for electronic polarization in liquids.
11973,"The problem has to do with the correct treatment of the permanent dipoles, and Onsager has pointed out the right way to go."
11974,"We do not have the time to treat the case now, but if you are interested it is discussed in Kittel’s book, Introduction to Solid State Physics."
11975,Now we turn to the solids.
11976,The first interesting fact about solids is that there can be a permanent polarization built in—which exists even without applying an electric field.
11977,"An example occurs with a material like wax, which contains long molecules having a permanent dipole moment."
11978,"If you melt some wax and put a strong electric field on it when it is a liquid, so that the dipole moments get partly lined up, they will stay that way when the liquid freezes."
11979,The solid material will have a permanent polarization which remains when the field is removed.
11980,Such a solid is called an electret.
11981,An electret has permanent polarization charges on its surface.
11982,It is the electrical analog of a magnet.
11983,"It is not as useful, though, because free charges from the air are attracted to its surfaces, eventually cancelling the polarization charges."
11984,The electret is “discharged” and there are no visible external fields.
11985,"In such crystals, each unit cell of the lattice has an identical permanent dipole moment, as drawn in Fig."
11986,11–8.
11987,"All the dipoles point in the same direction, even with no applied electric field."
11988,"Many complicated crystals have, in fact, such a polarization; we do not normally notice it because the external fields are discharged, just as for the electrets."
11989,"If these internal dipole moments of a crystal are changed, however, external fields appear because there is not time for stray charges to gather and cancel the polarization charges."
11990,"If the dielectric is in a condenser, free charges will be induced on the electrodes."
11991,"For example, the moments can change when a dielectric is heated, because of thermal expansion."
11992,The effect is called pyroelectricity.
11993,"Similarly, if we change the stresses in a crystal—for instance, if we bend it—again the moment may change a little bit, and a small electrical effect, called piezoelectricity, can be detected."
11994,"For crystals that do not have a permanent moment, one can work out a theory of the dielectric constant that involves the electronic polarizability of the atoms."
11995,It goes much the same as for liquids.
11996,In ionic crystals such as NaCl there is also ionic polarizability.
11997,"The crystal consists of a checkerboard of positive and negative ions, and in an electric field the positive ions are pulled one way and the negatives the other; there is a net relative motion of the plus and minus charges, and so a volume polarization."
11998,"We could estimate the magnitude of the ionic polarizability from our knowledge of the stiffness of salt crystals, but we will not go into that subject here."
11999,"We want to describe now one special class of crystals which have, just by accident almost, a built-in permanent moment."
12000,The situation is so marginal that if we increase the temperature a little bit they lose the permanent moment completely.
12001,"On the other hand, if they are nearly cubic crystals, so that their moments can be turned in different directions, we can detect a large change in the moment when an applied electric field is changed."
12002,All the moments flip over and we get a large effect.
12003,"Substances which have this kind of permanent moment are called ferroelectric, after the corresponding ferromagnetic effects which were first discovered in iron."
12004,We would like to explain how ferroelectricity works by describing a particular example of a ferroelectric material.
12005,This material has a crystal lattice whose basic cell is sketched in Fig.
12006,11–9.
12007,"Below this temperature, however, it suddenly takes on a permanent moment."
12008,"In working out the polarization of solid material, we must first find what are the local fields in each unit cell."
12009,"We must include the fields from the polarization itself, just as we did for the case of a liquid."
12010,"But a crystal is not a homogeneous liquid, so we cannot use for the local field what we would get in a spherical hole."
12011,Now when we wrote Eq.
12012,But that surely cannot be right.
12013,"But a bigger local field will polarize each atom more, raising the local fields still more."
12014,"If the “give” of the atoms is enough, the process keeps going; there is a kind of feedback that causes the polarization to increase without limit—assuming that the polarization of each atom increases in proportion to the field."
12015,"The polarization does not become infinite, of course, because the proportionality between the induced moment and the electric field breaks down at high fields, so that our formulas are no longer correct."
12016,"What happens is that the lattice gets “locked in” with a high, self-generated, internal polarization."
12017,"The lattice resists large motions, so after the titanium has gone a little way, it jams up and stops."
12018,But the crystal cell is then left with a permanent dipole moment.
12019,"In most crystals, this is really the situation for all temperatures that can be reached."
12020,"Below the critical temperature it is just barely stuck, so it is easy—by applying an external field—to shift the polarization and have it lock in a different direction."
12021,Let’s see if we can analyze what happens in more detail.
12022,It is also very sensitive to temperature.
12023,"When we lower the temperature to the critical temperature, what happens?"
12024,If we imagine a lattice of unit cells like that in Fig.
12025,"11–9, we see that it is possible to pick out chains of ions along vertical lines."
12026,One of them consists of alternating oxygen and titanium ions.
12027,"There are other lines made up of either barium or oxygen ions, but the spacing along these lines is greater."
12028,"We make a simple model to imitate this situation by imagining, as shown in Fig."
12029,"11–10(a), a series of chains of ions."
12030,There are less-dense chains in between which we will ignore for the moment.
12031,"To make the analysis a little easier, we will also suppose that all the ions on the main chain are identical."
12032,(It is not a serious simplification because all the important effects will still appear.
12033,This is one of the tricks of theoretical physics.
12034,"One does a different problem because it is easier to figure out the first time—then when one understands how the thing works, it is time to put in all the complications.)"
12035,Now let’s try to find out what would happen with our model.
12036,We must find the sum of the fields from all the other atoms.
12037,We will first calculate the field from the dipoles in only one vertical chain; we will talk about the other chains later.
12038,(11.6).
12039,(11.32).
12040,We can compare this with the known polarizabilities of the individual atoms.
12041,To use our model we should probably take the average.
12042,"(We could work out the chain again for alternating atoms, but the result would be about the same.)"
12043,But wait a moment!
12044,We have so far only added up the electronic polarizabilities.
12045,There is also some ionic polarization due to the motion of the titanium ion.
12046,Why the titanium ion in barium titanate should have that much ionic polarizability is not known.
12047,"Furthermore, why, at a lower temperature, it polarizes along the cube diagonal and the face diagonal equally well is not clear."
12048,If we figure out the actual size of the spheres in Fig.
12049,"11–9, and ask whether the titanium is a little bit loose in the box formed by its neighboring oxygen atoms—which is what you would hope, so that it could be easily shifted—you find quite the contrary."
12050,It fits very tightly.
12051,"The barium atoms are slightly loose, but if you let them be the ones that move, it doesn’t work out."
12052,So you see that the subject is really not one-hundred percent clear; there are still mysteries we would like to understand.
12053,Returning to our simple model of Fig.
12054,"11–10(a), we see that the field from one chain would tend to polarize the neighboring chain in the opposite direction, which means that although each chain would be locked, there would be no net permanent moment per unit volume!"
12055,"(Although there would be no external electric effects, there are still certain thermodynamic effects one could observe.)"
12056,"Such systems exist, and are called antiferroelectric."
12057,So what we have explained is really an antiferroelectric.
12058,"Barium titanate, however, is really like the arrangement in Fig."
12059,11–10(b).
12060,The oxygen-titanium chains are all polarized in the same direction because there are intermediate chains of atoms in between.
12061,"Although the atoms in these chains are not very polarizable, or very dense, they will be somewhat polarized, in the direction antiparallel to the oxygen-titanium chains."
12062,The small fields produced at the next oxygen-titanium chain will get it started parallel to the first.
12063,"This completes our rather detailed report on our present understanding of the dielectric constants of gases, of liquids, and of solids."
12064,"The total amount of information which has been acquired about the physical world since the beginning of scientific progress is enormous, and it seems almost impossible that any one person could know a reasonable fraction of it."
12065,But it is actually quite possible for a physicist to retain a broad knowledge of the physical world rather than to become a specialist in some narrow area.
12066,"The reasons for this are threefold: First, there are great principles which apply to all the different kinds of phenomena—such as the principles of the conservation of energy and of angular momentum."
12067,A thorough understanding of such principles gives an understanding of a great deal all at once.
12068,"Second, there is the fact that many complicated phenomena, such as the behavior of solids under compression, really basically depend on electrical and quantum-mechanical forces, so that if one understands the fundamental laws of electricity and quantum mechanics, there is at least some possibility of understanding many of the phenomena that occur in complex situations."
12069,"Finally, there is a most remarkable coincidence: The equations for many different physical situations have exactly the same appearance."
12070,"Of course, the symbols may be different—one letter is substituted for another—but the mathematical form of the equations is the same."
12071,"This means that having studied one subject, we immediately have a great deal of direct and precise knowledge about the solutions of the equations of another."
12072,"We are now finished with the subject of electrostatics, and will soon go on to study magnetism and electrodynamics."
12073,"But before doing so, we would like to show that while learning electrostatics we have simultaneously learned about a large number of other subjects."
12074,We will find that the equations of electrostatics appear in several other places in physics.
12075,By a direct translation of the solutions (of course the same mathematical equations must have the same solutions) it is possible to solve problems in other fields with the same ease—or with the same difficulty—as in electrostatics.
12076,"Whatever we know about electrostatics can immediately be carried over into that other subject, and vice versa."
12077,"(It works both ways, of course—if the other subject has some particular characteristics that are known, then we can apply that knowledge to the corresponding electrostatic problem.)"
12078,We want to consider a series of examples from different subjects that produce equations of this form.
12079,We have discussed one example earlier (Section 3–4)—the flow of heat.
12080,"Imagine a block of material, which need not be homogeneous but may consist of different materials at different places, in which the temperature varies from point to point."
12081,It represents the amount of heat energy which flows per unit time through a unit area perpendicular to the flow.
12082,"We will not bother to translate the equations back and forth between the differential and the integral forms, because it goes exactly the same as in electrostatics.)"
12083,"The rate at which heat is generated or absorbed at various places depends, of course, on the problem."
12084,"Suppose, for example, that there is a source of heat inside the material (perhaps a radioactive source, or a resistor heated by an electrical current)."
12085,There may also be losses (or gains) of thermal energy to other internal energies in the volume.
12086,"We are not going to discuss just now the complete equation in which things change with time, because we are making an analogy to electrostatics, where nothing depends on the time."
12087,"We will consider only steady heat-flow problems, in which constant sources have produced an equilibrium state."
12088,"It is, of course, necessary to have another equation, which describes how the heat flows at various places."
12089,"In many materials the heat current is approximately proportional to the rate of change of the temperature with position: the larger the temperature difference, the more the heat current."
12090,"As we have seen, the vector heat current is proportional to the temperature gradient."
12091,"[Equation (12.7) is not as fundamental as (12.5), which expresses the conservation of heat energy, since the former depends upon a special property of the substance.]"
12092,If now we substitute Eq.
12093,(12.7) into Eq.
12094,Steady heat-flow problems and electrostatic problems are the same.
12095,"We can, in general, solve static heat problems as easily as we can solve electrostatic problems."
12096,Consider a simple example.
12097,"(It could be, for example, a wire carrying a current, or a pipe with steam condensing inside.)"
12098,12–1a).
12099,"We want to find out at what rate heat will be lost by the wire, or steampipe, or whatever it is in the center."
12100,How can we solve this problem?
12101,"We have the differential equations, but since these are the same as those of electrostatics, we have really already solved the mathematical problem."
12102,12–1(b).
12103,We have solved the electrostatic problem by using Gauss’ law.
12104,We follow the same procedure for our heat-flow problem.
12105,"From our knowledge of electrostatics, we also know how much heat is lost by an insulated pipe."
12106,Let’s consider another example of heat flow.
12107,"Suppose we wish to know the heat flow in the neighborhood of a point source of heat located a little way beneath the surface of the earth, or near the surface of a large metal block."
12108,"The localized heat source might be an atomic bomb that was set off underground, leaving an intense source of heat, or it might correspond to a small radioactive source inside a block of iron—there are numerous possibilities."
12109,And we will neglect the thermal conductivity of the air outside the material.
12110,We want to determine the distribution of the temperature on the surface of the block.
12111,How hot is it right above the source and at various places on the surface of the block?
12112,How shall we solve it?
12113,Aha!
12114,"Perhaps it is the analog of a point charge near the boundary between a dielectric and a conductor, or something similar."
12115,Let’s see what the situation is near the surface.
12116,There is none!
12117,That is one of the things that we have to watch out for.
12118,"For physical reasons, there may be certain restrictions in the kinds of mathematical conditions which arise in any one subject."
12119,"So if we have analyzed the differential equation only for certain limited cases, we may have missed some kinds of solutions that can occur in other physical situations."
12120,"For example, there is no material with a dielectric constant of zero, whereas a vacuum does have zero thermal conductivity."
12121,So there is no electrostatic analogy for a perfect heat insulator.
12122,"We can, however, still use the same methods."
12123,We can try to imagine what would happen if the dielectric constant were zero.
12124,"(Of course, the dielectric constant is never zero in any real situation."
12125,"But we might have a case in which there is a material with a very high dielectric constant, so that we could neglect the dielectric constant of the air outside.)"
12126,How shall we find an electric field that has no component perpendicular to the surface?
12127,"That is, one which is always tangent at the surface?"
12128,You will notice that our problem is opposite to the one of a point charge near a plane conductor.
12129,"There we wanted the field to be perpendicular to the surface, because the conductor was all at the same potential."
12130,"In the electrical problem, we invented a solution by imagining a point charge behind the conducting plate."
12131,We can use the same idea again.
12132,We try to pick an “image source” that will automatically make the normal component of the field zero at the surface.
12133,The solution is shown in Fig.
12134,12–2.
12135,The normal components of the two sources cancel out.
12136,Thus our heat flow problem is solved.
12137,"The temperature everywhere is the same, by direct analogy, as the potential due to two equal point charges!"
12138,Several isothermal surfaces are shown in Fig.
12139,12–2.
12140,We originally asked for the temperature distribution on the surface.
12141,"The temperature is, naturally, higher right above the source than it is farther away."
12142,This is the kind of problem that geophysicists often need to solve.
12143,We now see that it is the same kind of thing we have already been solving for electricity.
12144,"Now let us consider a completely different physical situation which, nevertheless, gives the same equations again."
12145,Consider a thin rubber sheet—a membrane—which has been stretched over a large horizontal frame (like a drumhead).
12146,Suppose now that the membrane is pushed up in one place and down in another; as shown in Fig.
12147,12–3.
12148,Can we describe the shape of the surface?
12149,We will show how the problem can be solved when the deflections of the membrane are not too large.
12150,There are forces in the sheet because it is stretched.
12151,"If we were to make a small cut anywhere, the two sides of the cut would pull apart (see Fig."
12152,12–4).
12153,"So there is a surface tension in the sheet, analogous to the one-dimensional tension in a stretched string."
12154,12–4.
12155,Suppose now that we look at a vertical cross section of the membrane.
12156,"It will appear as a curve, like the one in Fig."
12157,12–5.
12158,There will be forces on the piece from the surface tension along each edge.
12159,"(There will be similar forces on the other two edges of the piece, but we will forget them for the moment.)"
12160,The distortions of the diaphragm are caused by external forces.
12161,"When the membrane is in equilibrium (the static case), this force must be balanced by the internal force we have just computed, Eq."
12162,(12.16).
12163,"(The distortions of a three-dimensional elastic body are also governed by similar equations, but we will stick to two-dimensions.)"
12164,We can then write for Eq.
12165,"We have another equation that is the same as for electrostatics!—only this time, limited to two-dimensions."
12166,"So all the work we have done for infinite plane charged sheets, or long parallel wires, or charged cylinders is directly applicable to the stretched membrane."
12167,That is the analog of having a definite potential at the corresponding places in an electrical situation.
12168,"So, for instance, we may make a positive “potential” by pushing up on the membrane with an object having the cross-sectional shape of the corresponding cylindrical conductor."
12169,"For example, if we push the sheet up with a round rod, the surface will take on the shape shown in Fig."
12170,12–6.
12171,The stretched rubber sheet has often been used as a way of solving complicated electrical problems experimentally.
12172,The analogy is used backwards!
12173,Various rods and bars are pushed against the sheet to heights that correspond to the potentials of a set of electrodes.
12174,Measurements of the height then give the electrical potential for the electrical situation.
12175,The analogy has been carried even further.
12176,"If little balls are placed on the membrane, their motion corresponds approximately to the motion of electrons in the corresponding electric field."
12177,One can actually watch the “electrons” move on their trajectories.
12178,"This method was used to design the complicated geometry of many photomultiplier tubes (such as the ones used for scintillation counters, and the one used for controlling the headlight beams on Cadillacs)."
12179,"The method is still used, but the accuracy is limited."
12180,"For the most accurate work, it is better to determine the fields by numerical methods, using the large electronic computing machines."
12181,"We take another example that gives the same kind of equation, this time having to do with diffusion."
12182,In Chapter 43 of Vol.
12183,"I we considered the diffusion of ions in a single gas, and of one gas through another."
12184,"This time, let’s take a different example—the diffusion of neutrons in a material like graphite."
12185,We choose to speak of graphite (a pure form of carbon) because carbon doesn’t absorb slow neutrons.
12186,In it the neutrons are free to wander around.
12187,"They travel in a straight line for several centimeters, on the average, before being scattered by a nucleus and deflected into a new direction."
12188,So if we have a large block—many meters on a side—the neutrons initially at one place will diffuse to other places.
12189,"We want to find a description of their average behavior—that is, their average flow."
12190,"If there are more neutrons in one region than in a nearby region, more neutrons will go from the first region to the second than come back; there will be a net flow."
12191,Following the arguments of Chapter 43 in Vol.
12192,(12.4) all over again!
12193,We can use our knowledge of electrostatics to solve problems about the diffusion of neutrons.
12194,So let’s solve a problem.
12195,(You may wonder: Why do a problem if we have already done all the problems in electrostatics?
12196,We can do it faster this time because we have done the electrostatic problems!)
12197,12–7).
12198,We would like to know: What is the density of neutrons everywhere?
12199,How uniform is the density of neutrons in the region where they are being generated?
12200,What is the ratio of the neutron density at the center to the neutron density at the surface of the source region?
12201,Finding the answers is easy.
12202,We have already worked out the fields inside and outside of a uniformly charged sphere; we can integrate them to get the potential.
12203,We know immediately the neutron density in our other problem.
12204,12–7.
12205,Now what is the ratio of density at the center to that at the edge?
12206,A uniform source doesn’t produce a uniform density of neutrons.
12207,"You see, our knowledge of electrostatics gives us a good start on the physics of nuclear reactors."
12208,There are many physical circumstances in which diffusion plays a big part.
12209,"The motion of ions through a liquid, or of electrons through a semiconductor, obeys the same equation."
12210,We find again and again the same equations.
12211,"Let’s now consider an example which is not really a very good one, because the equations we will use will not really represent the subject with complete generality but only in an artificial idealized situation."
12212,We take up the problem of water flow.
12213,"In the case of the stretched sheet, our equations were an approximation which was correct only for small deflections."
12214,"For our consideration of water flow, we will not make that kind of an approximation; we must make restrictions that do not apply at all to real water."
12215,"We treat only the case of the steady flow of an incompressible, nonviscous, circulation-free liquid."
12216,We will assume that there are no processes for the continuous creation or destruction of matter.
12217,Good!
12218,Not so!
12219,It is a pair of equations.
12220,One equation does not tell us enough; we need still an additional equation.
12221,But that is not generally true for real liquids.
12222,Most liquids will ordinarily develop some circulation.
12223,So we are restricted to the situation in which there is no circulation of the fluid.
12224,Such flow is often called irrotational.
12225,"Anyway, if we make all our assumptions, we can imagine a case of fluid flow that is analogous to electrostatics."
12226,"We want to emphasize that the number of circumstances in which liquid flow follows these equations is far from the great majority, but there are a few."
12227,"They must be cases in which we can neglect surface tension, compressibility, and viscosity, and in which we can assume that the flow is irrotational."
12228,These assumptions are valid so rarely for real water that the mathematician John von Neumann said that people who analyze Eqs.
12229,(12.28) and (12.29) are studying “dry water”!
12230,(We take up the problem of fluid flow in more detail in Chapters 40 and 41.)
12231,There isn’t any very useful meaning.
12232,The velocity can be written as the gradient of a potential simply because the flow is irrotational.
12233,Let’s pick a problem in irrotational flow and see whether we can solve it by the methods we have learned.
12234,Consider the problem of a spherical ball falling through a liquid.
12235,"If it is going too slowly, the viscous forces, which we are disregarding, will be important."
12236,"If it is going too fast, little whirlpools (turbulence) will appear in its wake and there will be some circulation of the water."
12237,"But if the ball is going neither too fast nor too slow, it is more or less true that the water flow will fit our assumptions, and we can describe the motion of the water by our simple equations."
12238,It is convenient to describe what happens in a frame of reference fixed in the sphere.
12239,In this frame we are asking the question: How does water flow past a sphere at rest when the flow at large distances is uniform?
12240,"That is, when, far from the sphere, the flow is everywhere the same."
12241,The flow near the sphere will be as shown by the streamlines drawn in Fig.
12242,12–8.
12243,We want a potential that satisfies Eq.
12244,"(12.31) everywhere, and which also satisfies two restrictions: (1) there is no flow in the spherical region inside the surface of the ball, and (2) the flow is constant at large distances."
12245,"Strictly speaking, there is no electrostatic case which corresponds exactly to our problem."
12246,It really corresponds to putting a sphere of dielectric constant zero in a uniform electric field.
12247,"We have not actually worked out this particular electrostatic problem in detail, but let’s do it now."
12248,That is a little different.
12249,It is not easy to get the answer immediately.
12250,"Now we have analyzed the case of a dielectric sphere which has a uniform polarization inside it, and we found that the field inside such a polarized sphere is a uniform field, and that outside it is the same as the field of a point dipole located at the center."
12251,So let’s guess that the solution we want is a superposition of a uniform field plus the field of a dipole.
12252,Our guess will automatically satisfy condition (2) above.
12253,(12.32).
12254,Note carefully that if both terms in Eq.
12255,The fact that it works out means that we have guessed wisely in writing Eq.
12256,(12.33).
12257,The dipole field is the only one that does all three.
12258,We will not pursue the matter further.
12259,In this section we turn to a completely different physical problem—we want to illustrate the great variety of possibilities.
12260,This time we will do something that leads to the same kind of integral that we found in electrostatics.
12261,"(If we have a mathematical problem which gives us a certain integral, then we know something about the properties of that integral if it is the same integral that we had to do for another problem.)"
12262,We take our example from illumination engineering.
12263,What is the illumination of the surface?
12264,"That is, what is the radiant energy per unit time arriving at a unit area of the surface?"
12265,(See Fig.
12266,12–9.)
12267,"We suppose that the source is spherically symmetric, so that light is radiated equally in all directions."
12268,Then the amount of radiant energy which passes through a unit area at right angles to a light flow varies inversely as the square of the distance.
12269,It is evident that the intensity of the light in the direction normal to the flow is given by the same kind of formula as for the electric field from a point source.
12270,"Knowing that, we see that for any distribution of light sources, we can find the answer by solving the corresponding electrostatic problem."
12271,We calculate the vertical component of electric field on the plane due to a distribution of charge in the same way as for that of the light sources.1
12272,Consider the following example.
12273,We wish for some special experimental situation to arrange that the top surface of a table will have a very uniform illumination.
12274,We have available long tubular fluorescent lights which radiate uniformly along their lengths.
12275,The amplitude of any one of these terms is given by Eq.
12276,The exponential factor would then give us directly the relative amplitude of the variations.
12277,It is somewhat surprising that for such a uniform illumination the allowed separation of the tubes comes out so large.
12278,"In this chapter, we wished to show that in learning electrostatics you have learned at the same time how to handle many subjects in physics, and that by keeping this in mind, it is possible to learn almost all of physics in a limited number of years."
12279,"However, a question surely suggests itself at the end of such a discussion: Why are the equations from different phenomena so similar?"
12280,We might say: “It is the underlying unity of nature.” But what does that mean?
12281,What could such a statement mean?
12282,"It could mean simply that the equations are similar for different phenomena; but then, of course, we have given no explanation."
12283,"The “underlying unity” might mean that everything is made out of the same stuff, and therefore obeys the same equations."
12284,"That sounds like a good explanation, but let us think."
12285,"The electrostatic potential, the diffusion of neutrons, heat flow—are we really dealing with the same stuff?"
12286,"Can we really imagine that the electrostatic potential is physically identical to the temperature, or to the density of particles?"
12287,The displacement of a membrane is certainly not like a temperature.
12288,"Why, then, is there “an underlying unity”?"
12289,"A closer look at the physics of the various subjects shows, in fact, that the equations are not really identical."
12290,The equation we found for neutron diffusion is only an approximation that is good when the distance over which we are looking is large compared with the mean free path.
12291,"If we look more closely, we would see the individual neutrons running around."
12292,Certainly the motion of an individual neutron is a completely different thing from the smooth variation we get from solving the differential equation.
12293,"The differential equation is an approximation, because we assume that the neutrons are smoothly distributed in space."
12294,Is it possible that this is the clue?
12295,"That the thing which is common to all the phenomena is the space, the framework into which the physics is put?"
12296,"As long as things are reasonably smooth in space, then the important things that will be involved will be the rates of change of quantities with position in space."
12297,That is why we always get an equation with a gradient.
12298,"The derivatives must appear in the form of a gradient or a divergence; because the laws of physics are independent of direction, they must be expressible in vector form."
12299,The equations of electrostatics are the simplest vector equations that one can get which involve only the spatial derivatives of quantities.
12300,Any other simple problem—or simplification of a complicated problem—must look like electrostatics.
12301,What is common to all our problems is that they involve space and that we have imitated what is actually a complicated phenomenon by a simple differential equation.
12302,That leads us to another interesting question.
12303,Is the same statement perhaps also true for the electrostatic equations?
12304,Are they also correct only as a smoothed-out imitation of a really much more complicated microscopic world?
12305,Could it be that the real world consists of little X-ons which can be seen only at very tiny distances?
12306,"And that in our measurements we are always observing on such a large scale that we can’t see these little X-ons, and that is why we get the differential equations?"
12307,Our currently most complete theory of electrodynamics does indeed have its difficulties at very short distances.
12308,"So it is possible, in principle, that these equations are smoothed-out versions of something."
12309,"It is possible that there is some as yet undiscovered underlying “machinery,” and that the details of an underlying complexity are hidden in the smooth-looking equations—as is so in the “smooth” diffusion of neutrons."
12310,But no one has yet formulated a successful theory that works that way.
12311,"Strangely enough, it turns out (for reasons that we do not at all understand) that the combination of relativity and quantum mechanics as we know them seems to forbid the invention of an equation that is fundamentally different from Eq."
12312,"(12.4), and which does not at the same time lead to some kind of contradiction."
12313,"Not simply a disagreement with experiment, but an internal contradiction."
12314,"As, for example, the prediction that the sum of the probabilities of all possible occurrences is not equal to unity, or that energies may sometimes come out as complex numbers, or some other such idiocy."
12315,"The force on an electric charge depends not only on where it is, but also on how fast it is moving."
12316,Every point in space is characterized by two vector quantities which determine the force on any charge.
12317,"First, there is the electric force, which gives a force component independent of the motion of the charge."
12318,"Second, there is an additional force component, called the magnetic force, which depends on the velocity of the charge."
12319,"This magnetic force has a strange directional character: At any particular point in space, both the direction of the force and its magnitude depend on the direction of motion of the particle: at every instant the force is always at right angles to the velocity vector; also, at any particular point, the force is always at right angles to a fixed direction in space (see Fig."
12320,"13–1); and finally, the magnitude of the force is proportional to the component of the velocity at right angles to this unique direction."
12321,The magnetic force is easily demonstrated by bringing a bar magnet close to a cathode-ray tube.
12322,"The deflection of the electron beam shows that the presence of the magnet results in forces on the electrons transverse to their direction of motion, as we described in Chapter 12 of Vol."
12323,I.
12324,It is also called one weber per square meter.
12325,We consider first how we can understand the magnetic forces on wires carrying electric currents.
12326,"In order to do this, we define what is meant by the current density."
12327,Electric currents are electrons or other charges in motion with a net drift or flow.
12328,We can represent the charge flow by a vector which gives the amount of charge passing per unit area and per unit time through a surface element at right angles to the flow (just as we did for the case of heat flow).
12329,It is directed along the motion of the charges.
12330,The current density is related to the average flow velocity of the charges.
12331,13–2.
12332,13–3).
12333,One of the basic laws of physics is that electric charge is indestructible; it is never lost or created.
12334,Electric charges can move from place to place but never appear from nowhere.
12335,We say that charge is conserved.
12336,"If there is a net current out of a closed surface, the amount of charge inside must decrease by the corresponding amount (Fig."
12337,13–4).
12338,).
12339,Now we are ready to find the force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field.
12340,13–5a).
12341,13–5b).
12342,"(Its magnitude is the electric current in the wire, and its direction is along the wire.)"
12343,"This equation gives the important result that the magnetic force on a wire, due to the movement of charges in it, depends only on the total current, and not on the amount of charge carried by each particle—or even its sign!"
12344,"The magnetic force on a wire near a magnet is easily shown by observing its deflection when a current is turned on, as was described in Chapter 1 (see Fig."
12345,1–6).
12346,"We have seen that there is a force on a wire in the presence of a magnetic field, produced, say, by a magnet."
12347,"From the principle that action equals reaction we might expect that there should be a force on the source of the magnetic field, i.e., on the magnet, when there is a current through the wire.1 There are indeed such forces, as is seen by the deflection of a compass needle near a current-carrying wire."
12348,"Now we know that magnets feel forces from other magnets, so that means that when there is a current in a wire, the wire itself generates a magnetic field."
12349,"Moving charges, then, produce a magnetic field."
12350,We would like now to try to discover the laws that determine how such magnetic fields are created.
12351,"The question is: Given a current, what magnetic field does it make?"
12352,The answer to this question was determined experimentally by three critical experiments and a brilliant theoretical argument given by Ampère.
12353,We will pass over this interesting historical development and simply say that a large number of experiments have demonstrated the validity of Maxwell’s equations.
12354,We take them as our starting point.
12355,"We may remark that it is rather dangerous to think that there is such a thing as a static magnetic situation, because there must be currents in order to get a magnetic field at all—and currents can come only from moving charges."
12356,"“Magnetostatics” is, therefore, an approximation."
12357,"It refers to a special kind of dynamic situation with large numbers of charges in motion, which we can approximate by a steady flow of charge."
12358,The subject should more accurately be called the study of steady currents.
12359,"(2.41), and obtain the two equations (13.12) and (13.13) above."
12360,"Also notice that since the divergence of the curl of any vector is necessarily zero, Eq."
12361,"This is true, by Eq."
12362,"They may, for instance, flow in wires that form complete loops—called circuits."
12363,"The circuits may, of course, contain generators or batteries that keep the charges flowing."
12364,But they may not include condensers which are charging or discharging.
12365,"(We will, of course, extend the theory later to include dynamic fields, but we want first to take the simpler case of steady currents.)"
12366,Now let us look at Eqs.
12367,(13.12) and (13.13) to see what they mean.
12368,Then where do they come from?
12369,Magnetic fields “appear” in the presence of currents; they have a curl proportional to the current density.
12370,"Wherever there are currents, there are lines of magnetic field making loops around the currents."
12371,But there can also be complicated situations in which the lines are not simple closed loops.
12372,"But whatever they do, they never diverge from points."
12373,"This much is true not only for magnetostatics, it is always true—even for dynamic fields."
12374,(13.13).
12375,Applying the same theorem to the magnetic field vector and using the symbols shown in Fig.
12376,"But, as we will see in the next section, it can be used to find the field in special circumstances which have certain simple symmetries."
12377,We can illustrate the use of Ampère’s law by finding the magnetic field near a wire.
12378,We ask: What is the field outside a long straight wire with a cylindrical cross section?
12379,"If we make this assumption, then Ampère’s law, Eq."
12380,"(13.16), tells us how strong the field is."
12381,13–7).
12382,"We can, if we wish, write Eq."
12383,(13.17) in vector form.
12384,"Since a current produces a magnetic field, it will exert a force on a nearby wire which is also carrying a current."
12385,In Chapter 1 we described a simple demonstration of the forces between two current-carrying wires.
12386,"When currents are in the same direction, the wires attract; when the currents are moving in opposite directions, the wires repel."
12387,Let’s take another example that can be analyzed by Ampère’s law if we add some knowledge about the field.
12388,"Suppose we have a long coil of wire wound in a tight spiral, as shown by the cross sections in Fig."
12389,13–8.
12390,Such a coil is called a solenoid.
12391,"We observe experimentally that when a solenoid is very long compared with its diameter, the field outside is very small compared with the field inside."
12392,"Using just that fact, together with Ampère’s law, we can find the size of the field inside."
12393,"Since the field stays inside (and has zero divergence), its lines must go along parallel to the axis, as shown in Fig."
12394,13–8.
12395,"Presumably, they spread out in some way and return to enter the solenoid at the other end, as sketched in Fig."
12396,13–9.
12397,Such a field is just what is observed outside of a bar magnet.
12398,But what is a magnet anyway?
12399,Yet we know that ordinary bars of iron (no batteries or generators) also produce magnetic fields.
12400,You might expect that there should be some other terms on the right-hand side of (13.12) or (13.13) to represent “the density of magnetic iron” or some such quantity.
12401,But there is no such term.
12402,Matter is very complex when looked at from a fundamental point of view—as we saw when we tried to understand dielectrics.
12403,"In order not to interrupt our present discussion, we will wait until later to deal in detail with the interior mechanisms of magnetic materials like iron: You will have to accept, for the moment, that all magnetism is produced from currents, and that in a permanent magnet there are permanent internal currents."
12404,"In the case of iron, these currents come from electrons spinning around their own axes."
12405,"Every electron has such a spin, which corresponds to a tiny circulating current."
12406,"Of course, one electron doesn’t produce much magnetic field, but in an ordinary piece of matter there are billions and billions of electrons."
12407,"Normally these spin and point every which way, so that there is no net effect."
12408,"The miracle is that in a very few substances, like iron, a large fraction of the electrons spin with their axes in the same direction—for iron, two electrons of each atom take part in this cooperative motion."
12409,"In a bar magnet there are large numbers of electrons all spinning in the same direction and, as we will see, their total effect is equivalent to a current circulating on the surface of the bar."
12410,(This is quite analogous to what we found for dielectrics—that a uniformly polarized dielectric is equivalent to a distribution of charges on its surface.)
12411,"It is, therefore, no accident that a bar magnet is equivalent to a solenoid."
12412,"When we said that the magnetic force on a charge was proportional to its velocity, you may have wondered: “What velocity?"
12413,But we have said nothing about which is the proper frame for specifying the magnetic field.
12414,It turns out that any inertial frame will do.
12415,We will also see that magnetism and electricity are not independent things—that they should always be taken together as one complete electromagnetic field.
12416,"Although in the static case Maxwell’s equations separate into two distinct pairs, one pair for electricity and one pair for magnetism, with no apparent connection between the two fields, nevertheless, in nature itself there is a very intimate relationship between them that arises from the principle of relativity."
12417,"Historically, the principle of relativity was discovered after Maxwell’s equations."
12418,"It was, in fact, the study of electricity and magnetism which led ultimately to Einstein’s discovery of his principle of relativity."
12419,But let’s see what our knowledge of relativity would tell us about magnetic forces if we assume that the relativity principle is applicable—as it is—to electromagnetism.
12420,13–10.
12421,"We will try to understand what goes on in two reference frames: one fixed with respect to the wire, as in part (a) of the figure, and one fixed with respect to the particle, as in part (b)."
12422,"The force is directed toward the wire, so if the charge were moving freely we would see it curve in toward the wire."
12423,"Does it, therefore, stay where it is?"
12424,Would we see different things happening in the two systems?
12425,We must try to understand why that would happen.
12426,We return to our atomic description of a wire carrying a current.
12427,"In a normal conductor, like copper, the electric currents come from the motion of some of the negative electrons—called the conduction electrons—while the positive nuclear charges and the remainder of the electrons stay fixed in the body of the material."
12428,Using the result we found in Eq.
12429,"But the particle is now at rest, so there is no magnetic force on it!"
12430,"If there is any force on the particle, it must come from an electric field."
12431,It must be that the moving wire has produced an electric field.
12432,But it can do that only if it appears charged—it must be that a neutral wire with a current appears to be charged when set in motion.
12433,We must look into this.
12434,"I), so volumes will change also."
12435,"Since the charge densities depend on the volume occupied by charges, the densities will change, too."
12436,Does its charge do something similar?
12437,No!
12438,"Charges are always the same, moving or not."
12439,Otherwise we would not always observe that the total charge is conserved.
12440,"Suppose that we take a block of material, say a conductor, which is initially uncharged."
12441,Now we heat it up.
12442,"Because the electrons have a different mass than the protons, the velocities of the electrons and of the protons will change by different amounts."
12443,"If the charge of a particle depended on the speed of the particle carrying it, in the heated block the charge of the electrons and protons would no longer balance."
12444,A block would become charged when heated.
12445,"As we have seen earlier, a very small fractional change in the charge of all the electrons in a block would give rise to enormous electric fields."
12446,No such effect has ever been observed.
12447,"Also, we can point out that the mean speed of the electrons in matter depends on its chemical composition."
12448,"If the charge on an electron changed with speed, the net charge in a piece of material would be changed in a chemical reaction."
12449,"Again, a straightforward calculation shows that even a very small dependence of charge on speed would give enormous fields from the simplest chemical reactions."
12450,"No such effect is observed, and we conclude that the electric charge of a single particle is independent of its state of motion."
12451,That means that in any frame the charge density of a distribution of electrons is just proportional to the number of electrons per unit volume.
12452,We need only worry about the fact that the volume can change because of the relativistic contraction of distances.
12453,We now apply these ideas to our moving wire.
12454,See Fig.
12455,13–11.
12456,In Eq.
12457,We have already solved the electrostatic problem of a uniformly charged cylinder.
12458,"(13.21), we see that the magnitudes of the forces are almost identical from the two points of view."
12459,"We can say that for low velocities, at least, we understand that magnetism and electricity are just “two ways of looking at the same thing.”"
12460,But things are even better than that.
12461,"If we take into account the fact that forces also transform when we go from one system to the other, we find that the two ways of looking at what happens do indeed give the same physical result for any velocity."
12462,One way of seeing this is to ask a question like: What transverse momentum will the particle have after the force has acted for a little while?
12463,We know from Chapter 16 of Vol.
12464,We have seen in Chapter 15 of Vol.
12465,I that the time intervals referred to a moving particle appear to be longer than those in the rest system of the particle.
12466,"We have found that we get the same physical result whether we analyze the motion of a particle moving along a wire in a coordinate system at rest with respect to the wire, or in a system at rest with respect to the particle."
12467,"In the first instance, the force was purely “magnetic,” in the second, it was purely “electric.” The two points of view are illustrated in Fig."
12468,Electric and magnetic forces are part of one physical phenomenon—the electromagnetic interactions of particles.
12469,The separation of this interaction into electric and magnetic parts depends very much on the reference frame chosen for the description.
12470,But a complete electromagnetic description is invariant; electricity and magnetism taken together are consistent with Einstein’s relativity.
12471,The lines may disappear if we try to observe them from a different coordinate system.
12472,"There is no way to make sense, in general, out of the idea of “the speed of a moving field line.” The fields are our way of describing what goes on at a point in space."
12473,The question “What is the force on a charge from a moving magnetic field?” doesn’t mean anything precise.
12474,"We will later be speaking of “a wave of electric and magnetic fields travelling through space,” as, for instance, a light wave."
12475,But that is like speaking of a wave travelling on a string.
12476,"We don’t then mean that some part of the string is moving in the direction of the wave, we mean that the displacement of the string appears first at one place and later at another."
12477,"Similarly, in an electromagnetic wave, the wave travels; but the magnitude of the fields change."
12478,"So in the future when we—or someone else—speaks of a “moving” field, you should think of it as just a handy, short way of describing a changing field in some circumstances."
12479,"We could go back and carry through the analysis again for two different velocities, but it is easier to simply notice that charge and current density are the components of a four-vector (see Chapter 17, Vol."
12480,I).
12481,With these equations we can relate charges and currents in one frame to those in another.
12482,"Taking the charges and currents in either frame, we can solve the electromagnetic problem in that frame by using our Maxwell equations."
12483,The result we obtain for the motions of particles will be the same no matter which frame we choose.
12484,We will return at a later time to the relativistic transformations of the electromagnetic fields.
12485,We will conclude this chapter by making two further points regarding the subject of magnetostatics.
12486,That means that the principle of superposition also applies to magnetic fields.
12487,The field produced by two different steady currents is the sum of the individual fields from each current acting alone.
12488,Our second remark concerns the right-hand rules which we have encountered (such as the right-hand rule for the magnetic field produced by a current).
12489,We have also observed that the magnetization of an iron magnet is to be understood from the spin of the electrons in the material.
12490,The direction of the magnetic field of a spinning electron is related to its spin axis by the same right-hand rule.
12491,(Vectors whose direction in space does not depend on a reference to a right or left hand are called polar vectors.
12492,"Physically observable quantities in electromagnetism are not, however, right- (or left-) handed."
12493,"Electromagnetic interactions are symmetrical under reflection (see Chapter 52, Vol."
12494,I).
12495,"Whenever magnetic forces between two sets of currents are computed, the result is invariant with respect to a change in the hand convention."
12496,"Our equations lead, independently of the right-hand convention, to the end result that parallel currents attract, or that currents in opposite directions repel."
12497,(Try working out the force using “left-hand rules.”)  An attraction or repulsion is a polar vector.
12498,Using the right-hand rule twice is the same as using the left-hand rule twice.
12499,"Although physicists have recently found to their surprise that all the laws of nature are not always invariant for mirror reflections, the laws of electromagnetism do have such a basic symmetry."
12500,In this chapter we continue our discussion of magnetic fields associated with steady currents—the subject of magnetostatics.
12501,(4.25).
12502,"For, as we saw in Section 2–7, the divergence of a curl is always zero."
12503,We can show this as follows.
12504,The choice should be made to get the greatest mathematical convenience and will depend on the problem we are doing.
12505,"The third solution, Eq."
12506,"(14.8), has some interesting properties."
12507,14–1.
12508,The vector potential for a uniform field can be obtained in another way.
12509,"In the example we have just given, we have calculated the vector potential from the magnetic field, which is opposite to what one normally does."
12510,"In complicated problems it is usually easier to solve for the vector potential, and then determine the magnetic field from it."
12511,We will now show how this can be done.
12512,"We have, then, a general method for finding the magnetic field of steady currents."
12513,(This principle works only with components in fixed directions.
12514,"It’s a little more complicated than electrostatics, but the same idea."
12515,We will now illustrate the theory by solving for the vector potential in a few special cases.
12516,"For our first example, we will again find the field of a straight wire—which we solved in the last chapter by using Eq."
12517,(14.2) and some arguments of symmetry.
12518,"Unlike the charge on a conductor in the electrostatic case, a steady current in a wire is uniformly distributed throughout the cross section of the wire."
12519,If we choose our coordinates as shown in Fig.
12520,There are only two of the six derivatives that are not zero.
12521,This surface current (see Fig.
12522,"We have not solved such a charge distribution, but we have done something similar."
12523,"We could work out the constant of proportionality, but let’s not worry about it for the moment."
12524,14–4.
12525,The question is: Is its curl zero?
12526,14.11).
12527,"We have been thinking of a solenoidal coil of wire, but we would produce the same fields if we rotated a long cylinder with an electrostatic charge on the surface."
12528,Now we can raise an interesting question.
12529,14–5.
12530,"If the cylinder has a positive charge, the end of the wire at the axis will have a negative charge."
12531,"By measuring the charge on the end of the wire, we could measure the speed of rotation of the system."
12532,We would have an “angular-velocity meter”!
12533,But are you wondering: “What if I put myself in the frame of reference of the rotating cylinder?
12534,"Then there is just a charged cylinder at rest, and I know that the electrostatic equations say there will be no electric fields inside, so there will be no force pushing charges to the center."
12535,So something must be wrong.” But there is nothing wrong.
12536,"There is no “relativity of rotation.” A rotating system is not an inertial frame, and the laws of physics are different."
12537,We must be sure to use equations of electromagnetism only with respect to inertial coordinate systems.
12538,"It would be nice if we could measure the absolute rotation of the earth with such a charged cylinder, but unfortunately the effect is much too small to observe even with the most delicate instruments now available."
12539,Let’s use the vector-potential method to find the magnetic field of a small loop of current.
12540,"As usual, by “small” we mean simply that we are interested in the fields only at distances large compared with the size of the loop."
12541,"It will turn out that any small loop is a “magnetic dipole.” That is, it produces a magnetic field like the electric field from an electric dipole."
12542,"We take first a rectangular loop, and choose our coordinates as shown in Fig."
12543,14–6.
12544,"In each leg, the current density (and current) is uniform."
12545,14–7).
12546,"Since the rods have opposite charges, their electric potential at large distances would be just the dipole potential (Section 6–5)."
12547,14–8.
12548,"This product is called the magnetic dipole moment (or, often, just “magnetic moment”) of the loop."
12549,is also given by Eqs.
12550,14–8).
12551,(See Eqs.
12552,(6.14) and (6.15); also Fig.
12553,6–4.)
12554,That’s why we call the loop a magnetic dipole.
12555,The word “dipole” is slightly misleading when applied to a magnetic field because there are no magnetic “poles” that correspond to electric charges.
12556,"The magnetic “dipole field” is not produced by two “charges,” but by an elementary current loop."
12557,Why should that be?
12558,It is because the dipole fields appear only when we are far away from all charges or currents.
12559,So they give the same solutions.
12560,"However, the sources whose configuration we summarize by the dipole moments are physically quite different—in one case, it’s a circulating current; in the other, a pair of charges, one above and one below the plane of the loop for the corresponding field."
12561,We are often interested in the magnetic fields produced by circuits of wire in which the diameter of the wire is very small compared with the dimensions of the whole system.
12562,"In such cases, we can simplify the equations for the magnetic field."
12563,14–10).
12564,"Again, we can find the fields from (14.38) either by integrating directly or by solving the corresponding electrostatic problems."
12565,"In studying electrostatics we found that the electric field of a known charge distribution could be obtained directly with an integral, Eq."
12566,There is a similar integral which relates the magnetic field to the currents.
12567,The geometry involved is the same as that shown in Fig.
12568,14–2.
12569,"Then, using the symbols in Fig."
12570,It gives a formula for obtaining directly the magnetic field produced by wires carrying currents.
12571,(14.41).
12572,"Finally, we will see that in more advanced theoretical matters (in relativity, in advanced formulations of the laws of mechanics, like the principle of least action to be discussed later, and in quantum mechanics) the vector potential plays an important role."
12573,In the last chapter we studied the magnetic field produced by a small rectangular current loop.
12574,"A current loop—or magnetic dipole—not only produces magnetic fields, but will also experience forces when placed in the magnetic field of other currents."
12575,We will look first at the forces on a rectangular loop in a uniform magnetic field.
12576,15–1.
12577,"Since the currents are opposite on opposite sides of the loop, the forces are also opposite, so there is no net force on the loop (when the field is uniform)."
12578,"(15.2) in one rather special case, the result is right for a small loop of any shape, as we will see."
12579,We now ask about the mechanical energy of our current loop.
12580,"Since there is a torque, the energy evidently depends on the orientation."
12581,"For reasons which we will discuss later, this energy is not the total energy of a current loop."
12582,"(We have, for one thing, not taken into account the energy required to maintain the current in the loop.)"
12583,"Also, since we are leaving out some of the energy anyway, we can set the constant of integration equal to zero in Eq."
12584,(15.3).
12585,The total force on the loop is zero only in a uniform field; in a nonuniform field there are net forces on a current loop.
12586,"In putting the loop into a region with a field, we must have gone through places where the field was not uniform, and so work was done."
12587,"To make the calculation simple, we shall imagine that the loop is brought into the field with its moment pointing along the field."
12588,(It can be rotated to its final position after it is in place.)
12589,15–2.
12590,We start somewhere where the field is zero and integrate the force times the distance as we bring the loop into the field.
12591,"First, let’s compute the work done on each side separately and then take the sum (rather than adding the forces before integrating)."
12592,(15.4).
12593,"We would, of course, have gotten the same result if we had added the forces on the loop before integrating to find the work."
12594,"We have, indeed, emphasized that it can be used like the energy, for computing forces from the principle of virtual work, provided that the current in the loop (and all other currents) do not change."
12595,Let’s see why all this works.
12596,Imagine that the loop in Fig.
12597,But because of their flow—as an electric current—there is a component of their motion in the same direction as the force.
12598,We will call this work done on the electrons electrical work.
12599,"Now it turns out that if the loop is moving in a uniform field, the total electrical work is zero, since positive work is done on some parts of the loop and an equal amount of negative work is done on other parts."
12600,But this is not true if the circuit is moving in a nonuniform field—then there will be a net amount of work done on the electrons.
12601,"In general, this work would tend to change the flow of the electrons, but if the current is being held constant, energy must be absorbed or delivered by the battery or other source that is keeping the current steady."
12602,"(15.9), because our computations included only the mechanical forces on the body of the wire."
12603,You may be thinking: But the force on the electrons depends on how fast the wire is moved; perhaps if the wire is moved slowly enough this electrical energy can be neglected.
12604,"It is true that the rate at which the electrical energy is delivered is proportional to the speed of the wire, but the total energy delivered is proportional also to the time that this rate goes on."
12605,"So the total electrical energy is proportional to the velocity times the time, which is just the distance moved."
12606,For a given distance moved in a field the same amount of electrical work is done.
12607,"Now since the current is held constant, the forces on the conduction electrons do not cause them to accelerate; the electrical energy is not going into the electrons but into the source that is keeping the current constant."
12608,"We conclude that the mechanical work done on the wire is just equal to the electrical work done on the current source, so the energy of the loop is a constant!"
12609,"This is not a coincidence, but a consequence of the law we already know."
12610,"We shall see later that changing magnetic fields produce electric fields, so our reasoning applies only to moving wires in steady magnetic fields."
12611,How is it then that the principle of virtual work gives the right answer?
12612,Because we still have not taken into account the total energy of the world.
12613,We have not included the energy of the currents that are producing the magnetic field we start out with.
12614,Suppose we imagine a complete system such as that drawn in Fig.
12615,This energy must also be included in our balance sheet of the total energy.
12616,"We could wait until the next chapter to find out about this new energy term, but we can also see what it will be if we use the principle of relativity in the following way."
12617,When we are moving the loop toward the stationary coil we know that its electrical energy is just equal and opposite to the mechanical work done.
12618,"Suppose now we look at what is happening from a different point of view, in which the loop is at rest, and the coil is moved toward it."
12619,The coil is then moving into the field produced by the loop.
12620,"In a more general problem, we must be careful to include all energies."
12621,We have seen an analogous situation in electrostatics.
12622,Now suppose that we were to calculate the work done in moving two conductors subject to the different condition that the voltage between them is held constant.
12623,Then we can get the right answers for force from the principle of virtual work if we do something artificial.
12624,(15.14).
12625,We get the correct result even though we are neglecting the work done by the electrical system to keep the voltage constant.
12626,"Again, this electrical energy is just twice as big as the mechanical energy and of the opposite sign."
12627,"Thus if we calculate artificially, disregarding the fact that the source of the potential has to do work to maintain the voltages constant, we get the right answer."
12628,It is exactly analogous to the situation in magnetostatics.
12629,We can begin with the true energy of a small current loop.
12630,We can find the energy of a circuit of any shape by imagining that it is made up of small current loops.
12631,15–4.
12632,"Physically, the system of little currents is indistinguishable from the original circuit."
12633,"The energy must also be the same, and so is just the sum of the energies of the little loops."
12634,Now any distribution of steady currents can be imagined to be made up of filaments that run parallel to the lines of current flow.
12635,For the total energy we want the sum of all such pairs.
12636,"Unfortunately, this idea is not too useful, because it is true only for static fields."
12637,"In fact, neither of the equations (15.20) and (15.21) gives the correct energy when the fields change with time."
12638,In this section we would like to discuss the following questions: Is the vector potential merely a device which is useful in making calculations—as the scalar potential is useful in electrostatics—or is the vector potential a “real” field?
12639,"Isn’t the magnetic field the “real” field, because it is responsible for the force on a moving particle?"
12640,First we should say that the phrase “a real field” is not very meaningful.
12641,"For one thing, you probably don’t feel that the magnetic field is very “real” anyway, because even the whole idea of a field is a rather abstract thing."
12642,You cannot put out your hand and feel the magnetic field.
12643,"Furthermore, the value of the magnetic field is not very definite; by choosing a suitable moving coordinate system, for instance, you can make a magnetic field at a given point disappear."
12644,What we mean here by a “real” field is this: a real field is a mathematical function we use for avoiding the idea of action at a distance.
12645,"If we know that condition, which we describe by giving the electric and magnetic fields, then we can determine completely the behavior of the particle—with no further reference to how those conditions came about."
12646,A “real” field is then a set of numbers we specify in such a way that what happens at a point depends only on the numbers at that point.
12647,We do not need to know any more about what’s going on at other places.
12648,It is in this sense that we will discuss whether the vector potential is a “real” field.
12649,You may be wondering about the fact that the vector potential is not unique—that it can be changed by adding the gradient of any scalar with no change at all in the forces on particles.
12650,"That has not, however, anything to do with the question of reality in the sense that we are talking about."
12651,But we are not worried about what happens if the field can be changed in this way.
12652,"That doesn’t really make any difference; that has nothing to do with the question of whether the vector potential is a proper “real” field for describing magnetic effects, or whether it is just a useful mathematical tool."
12653,The advantages are much less clear for magnetostatics.
12654,Using the vector potential is often more difficult for simple problems for the following reason.
12655,(15.25).
12656,"In the ring problem, for example, we would need to use elliptic integrals."
12657,"Not only is it related to the energies of currents, as we saw in the last section, but it is also a “real” physical field in the sense that we described above."
12658,In the next section we will show you how that works.
12659,There are many changes in what concepts are important when we go from classical to quantum mechanics.
12660,We have already discussed some of them in Vol.
12661,I.
12662,"In particular, the force concept gradually fades away, while the concepts of energy and momentum become of paramount importance."
12663,"You remember that instead of particle motions, one deals with probability amplitudes which vary in space and time."
12664,"In these amplitudes there are wavelengths related to momenta, and frequencies related to energies."
12665,"The momenta and energies, which determine the phases of wave functions, are therefore the important quantities in quantum mechanics."
12666,"Instead of forces, we deal with the way interactions change the wavelength of the waves."
12667,The idea of a force becomes quite secondary—if it is there at all.
12668,"When people talk about nuclear forces, for example, what they usually analyze and work with are the energies of interaction of two nucleons, and not the force between them."
12669,Nobody ever differentiates the energy to find out what the force looks like.
12670,In this section we want to describe how the vector and scalar potentials enter into quantum mechanics.
12671,We must review a little how quantum mechanics works.
12672,We will consider again the imaginary experiment described in Chapter 37 of Vol.
12673,"I, in which electrons are diffracted by two slits."
12674,The arrangement is shown again in Fig.
12675,15–5.
12676,"Electrons, all of nearly the same energy, leave the source and travel toward a wall with two narrow slits."
12677,Beyond the wall is a “backstop” with a movable detector.
12678,The rate is proportional to the probability that an individual electron that leaves the source will reach that region of the backstop.
12679,"This probability has the complicated-looking distribution shown in the figure, which we understand as due to the interference of two amplitudes, one from each slit."
12680,The interference of the two amplitudes depends on their phase difference.
12681,(29.12) in Vol.
12682,I].
12683,So we get the wavy function for the electron intensity.
12684,It will be the law that determines the behavior of quantum-mechanical particles in an electromagnetic field.
12685,"Since what happens is determined by amplitudes, the law must tell us how the magnetic influences affect the amplitudes; we are no longer dealing with the acceleration of a particle."
12686,The law is the following: the phase of the amplitude to arrive via any trajectory is changed by the presence of a magnetic field by an amount equal to the integral of the vector potential along the whole trajectory times the charge of the particle over Planck’s constant.
12687,"If there is a magnetic field anywhere, the phase of the arriving wave is increased by the integral in Eq."
12688,(15.29).
12689,"We want now, however, to consider only a static magnetic field."
12690,Suppose that there is a magnetic field present in the two-slit experiment.
12691,We want to ask for the phase of arrival at the screen of the two waves whose paths pass through the two slits.
12692,Their interference determines where the maxima in the probability will be.
12693,(15.28).
12694,"Before we do that, however, we want to raise the following interesting and important point."
12695,You remember that the vector potential function has some arbitrariness.
12696,If in Eq.
12697,The same conclusion is evident if we use the results of Section 14–1.
12698,But the definition of “real” field that we originally proposed was based on the idea that a “real” field would not act on a particle from a distance.
12699,15–6.
12700,(15.33).
12701,"Classically, that is impossible."
12702,But quantum-mechanically you can find out that there is a magnetic field inside the solenoid by going around it—without ever going close to it!
12703,"Suppose that we put a very long solenoid of small diameter just behind the wall and between the two slits, as shown in Fig."
12704,15–7.
12705,"In these circumstances, the diffraction of the electrons at the slit gives no appreciable probability that the electrons will get near the solenoid."
12706,What will be the effect on our interference experiment?
12707,We compare the situation with and without a current through the solenoid.
12708,The maximum intensity will occur where the phase difference between the two waves is zero.
12709,Using Eq.
12710,(15.33) or Eq.
12711,15–7.
12712,"At least, that is the prediction of quantum mechanics."
12713,Precisely this experiment has recently been done.
12714,"It is a very, very difficult experiment."
12715,"Because the wavelength of the electrons is so small, the apparatus must be on a tiny scale to observe the interference."
12716,"The slits must be very close together, and that means that one needs an exceedingly small solenoid."
12717,"It turns out that in certain circumstances, iron crystals will grow in the form of very long, microscopically thin filaments called whiskers."
12718,"When these iron whiskers are magnetized they are like a tiny solenoid, and there is no field outside except near the ends."
12719,"The electron interference experiment was done with such a whisker between two slits, and the predicted displacement in the pattern of electrons was observed."
12720,"If we want to describe its influence not as action-at-a-distance, we must use the vector potential."
12721,This subject has an interesting history.
12722,The theory we have described was known from the beginning of quantum mechanics in 1926.
12723,The fact that the vector potential appears in the wave equation of quantum mechanics (called the Schrödinger equation) was obvious from the day it was written.
12724,That it cannot be replaced by the magnetic field in any easy way was observed by one man after the other who tried to do so.
12725,This is also clear from our example of electrons moving in a region where there is no field and being affected nevertheless.
12726,"It seems strange in retrospect that no one thought of discussing this experiment until 1956, when Bohm and Aharonov first suggested it and made the whole question crystal clear."
12727,"The implication was there all the time, but no one paid attention to it."
12728,Thus many people were rather shocked when the matter was brought up.
12729,"That’s why someone thought it would be worthwhile to do the experiment to see that it really was right, even though quantum mechanics, which had been believed for so many years, gave an unequivocal answer."
12730,"It is interesting that something like this can be around for thirty years but, because of certain prejudices of what is and is not significant, continues to be ignored."
12731,Now we wish to continue in our analysis a little further.
12732,"To get classical mechanics from quantum mechanics, we need to consider cases in which all the wavelengths are very small compared with distances over which external conditions, like fields, vary appreciably."
12733,"We shall not prove the result in great generality, but only in a very simple example, to show how it works."
12734,Again we consider the same slit experiment.
12735,"But instead of putting all the magnetic field in a very tiny region between the slits, we imagine a magnetic field that extends over a larger region behind the slits, as shown in Fig."
12736,15–8.
12737,(That can easily be arranged; the backstop can be put as far out as we want.)
12738,Using Eq.
12739,15–9(a).
12740,We can compare this result with Eq.
12741,"(15.39), which gives the same quantity computed quantum-mechanically."
12742,From the analysis we see how it is that the vector potential which appears in quantum mechanics in an explicit form produces a classical force which depends only on its derivatives.
12743,This becomes more and more apparent the more deeply we go into the quantum theory.
12744,We are now at the end of our exploration of the subject of static fields.
12745,Already in this chapter we have come perilously close to having to worry about what happens when fields change with time.
12746,We were barely able to avoid it in our treatment of magnetic energy by taking refuge in a relativistic argument.
12747,"Even so, our treatment of the energy problem was somewhat artificial and perhaps even mysterious, because we ignored the fact that moving coils must, in fact, produce changing fields."
12748,It is now time to take up the treatment of time-varying fields—the subject of electrodynamics.
12749,We will do so in the next chapter.
12750,"First, however, we would like to emphasize a few points."
12751,"Although we began this course with a presentation of the complete and correct equations of electromagnetism, we immediately began to study some incomplete pieces—because that was easier."
12752,"There is a great advantage in starting with the simpler theory of static fields, and proceeding only later to the more complicated theory which includes dynamic fields."
12753,"There is less new material to learn all at once, and there is time for you to develop your intellectual muscles in preparation for the bigger task."
12754,"But there is the danger in this process that before we get to see the complete story, the incomplete truths learned on the way may become ingrained and taken as the whole truth—that what is true and what is only sometimes true will become confused."
12755,"So we give in Table 15–1 a summary of the important formulas we have covered, separating those which are true in general from those which are true for statics, but false for dynamics."
12756,"This summary also shows, in part, where we are going, since as we treat dynamics we will be developing in detail what we must just state here without proof."
12757,It may be useful to make a few remarks about the table.
12758,"First, you should notice that the equations we started with are the true equations—we have not misled you there."
12759,"It is only Coulomb’s law that is false, to be used only for statics."
12760,"The equations we took for statics are false, of course, because we left off all terms with time derivatives."
12761,"We will see that a scalar potential still remains, but it is a time-varying quantity that must be used together with vector potentials for a complete description of the electric field."
12762,"The equations governing this new scalar potential are, necessarily, also new."
12763,"When the fields are changing, the charges in conductors do not, in general, have time to rearrange themselves to make the field zero."
12764,"They are set in motion, but never reach equilibrium."
12765,The only general statement is: electric fields in conductors produce currents.
12766,So in varying fields a conductor is not an equipotential.
12767,It also follows that the idea of a capacitance is no longer precise.
12768,(Everything doesn’t change!)
12769,"Most wonderfully, though, the true integrals are like the static ones, with only a small and physically appealing modification."
12770,You should not be misled into thinking that this is at all “natural.” The validity of any formula derived in the static case must be demonstrated over again for the dynamic case.
12771,This result is true only for statics.
12772,"We will consider all these matters in more detail in due time, but it will perhaps be useful to keep in mind this summary, so you will know what you can forget, and what you should remember as always true."
12773,"The discovery in 1820 that there was a close connection between electricity and magnetism was very exciting—until then, the two subjects had been considered as quite independent."
12774,"The first discovery was that currents in wires make magnetic fields; then, in the same year, it was found that wires carrying current in a magnetic field have forces on them."
12775,One of the excitements whenever there is a mechanical force is the possibility of using it in an engine to do work.
12776,"Almost immediately after their discovery, people started to design electric motors using the forces on current-carrying wires."
12777,The principle of the electromagnetic motor is shown in bare outline in Fig.
12778,16–1.
12779,A permanent magnet—usually with some pieces of soft iron—is used to produce a magnetic field in two slots.
12780,"Across each slot there is a north and south pole, as shown."
12781,A rectangular coil of copper is placed with one side in each slot.
12782,"When a current passes through the coil, it flows in opposite directions in the two slots, so the forces are also opposite, producing a torque on the coil about the axis shown."
12783,"If the coil is mounted on a shaft so that it can turn, it can be coupled to pulleys or gears and can do work."
12784,The same idea can be used for making a sensitive instrument for electrical measurements.
12785,Thus the moment the force law was discovered the precision of electrical measurements was greatly increased.
12786,"First, the torque of such a motor can be made much greater for a given current by making the current go around many turns instead of just one."
12787,Then the coil can be mounted so that it turns with very little torque—either by supporting its shaft on very delicate jewel bearings or by hanging the coil on a very fine wire or a quartz fiber.
12788,"Then an exceedingly small current will make the coil turn, and for small angles the amount of rotation will be proportional to the current."
12789,"The rotation can be measured by gluing a pointer to the coil or, for the most delicate instruments, by attaching a small mirror to the coil and looking at the shift of the image of a scale."
12790,Such instruments are called galvanometers.
12791,Voltmeters and ammeters work on the same principle.
12792,The same ideas can be applied on a large scale to make large motors for providing mechanical power.
12793,The coil can be made to go around and around by arranging that the connections to the coil are reversed each half-turn by contacts mounted on the shaft.
12794,Then the torque is always in the same direction.
12795,Small dc motors are made just this way.
12796,"Larger motors, dc or ac, are often made by replacing the permanent magnet by an electromagnet, energized from the electrical power source."
12797,"With the realization that electric currents make magnetic fields, people immediately suggested that, somehow or other, magnets might also make electric fields."
12798,Various experiments were tried.
12799,"For example, two wires were placed parallel to each other and a current was passed through one of them in the hope of finding a current in the other."
12800,"The thought was that the magnetic field might in some way drag the electrons along in the second wire, giving some such law as “likes prefer to move alike.” With the largest available current and the most sensitive galvanometer to detect any current, the result was negative."
12801,Large magnets next to wires also produced no observed effects.
12802,"Finally, Faraday discovered in 1840 the essential feature that had been missed—that electric effects exist only when there is something changing."
12803,"If one of a pair of wires has a changing current, a current is induced in the other, or if a magnet is moved near an electric circuit, there is a current."
12804,We say that currents are induced.
12805,This was the induction effect discovered by Faraday.
12806,It transformed the rather dull subject of static fields into a very exciting dynamic subject with an enormous range of wonderful phenomena.
12807,This chapter is devoted to a qualitative description of some of them.
12808,"As we will see, one can quickly get into fairly complicated situations that are hard to analyze quantitatively in all their details."
12809,"But never mind, our main purpose in this chapter is first to acquaint you with the phenomena involved."
12810,We will take up the detailed analysis later.
12811,"We can easily understand one feature of magnetic induction from what we already know, although it was not known in Faraday’s time."
12812,"Suppose that we have a wire which passes near a magnet, as shown in Fig."
12813,"16–2, and that we connect the ends of the wire to a galvanometer."
12814,If we move the wire across the end of the magnet the galvanometer pointer moves.
12815,"The magnet produces some vertical magnetic field, and when we push the wire across the field, the electrons in the wire feel a sideways force—at right angles to the field and to the motion."
12816,The force pushes the electrons along the wire.
12817,"But why does this move the galvanometer, which is so far from the force?"
12818,"Because when the electrons which feel the magnetic force try to move, they push—by electric repulsion—the electrons a little farther down the wire; they, in turn, repel the electrons a little farther on, and so on for a long distance."
12819,An amazing thing.
12820,It was so amazing to Gauss and Weber—who first built a galvanometer—that they tried to see how far the forces in the wire would go.
12821,They strung a wire all the way across their city.
12822,"Mr. Gauss, at one end, connected the wires to a battery (batteries were known before generators) and Mr. Weber watched the galvanometer move."
12823,They had a way of signaling long distances—it was the beginning of the telegraph!
12824,"Of course, this has nothing directly to do with induction—it has to do with the way wires carry currents, whether the currents are pushed by induction or not."
12825,Now suppose in the setup of Fig.
12826,16–2 we leave the wire alone and move the magnet.
12827,We still see an effect on the galvanometer.
12828,"As Faraday discovered, moving the magnet under the wire—one way—has the same effect as moving the wire over the magnet—the other way."
12829,This is the new effect that Faraday found.
12830,"Today, we might hope to understand it from a relativity argument."
12831,We already understand that the magnetic field of a magnet comes from its internal currents.
12832,So we expect to observe the same effect if instead of a magnet in Fig.
12833,16–2 we use a coil of wire in which there is a current.
12834,"If we move the wire past the coil there will be a current through the galvanometer, or also if we move the coil past the wire."
12835,"But there is now a more exciting thing: If we change the magnetic field of the coil not by moving it, but by changing its current, there is again an effect in the galvanometer."
12836,"For example, if we have a loop of wire near a coil, as shown in Fig."
12837,"16–3, and if we keep both of them stationary but switch off the current, there is a pulse of current through the galvanometer."
12838,"When we switch the coil on again, the galvanometer kicks in the other direction."
12839,Whenever the galvanometer in a situation such as the one shown in Fig.
12840,"16–2, or in Fig."
12841,"16–3, has a current, there is a net push on the electrons in the wire in one direction along the wire."
12842,"There may be pushes in different directions at different places, but there is more push in one direction than another."
12843,What counts is the push integrated around the complete circuit.
12844,We call this net integrated push the electromotive force (abbreviated emf) in the circuit.
12845,"More precisely, the emf is defined as the tangential force per unit charge in the wire integrated over length, once around the complete circuit."
12846,"Faraday’s complete discovery was that emf’s can be generated in a wire in three different ways: by moving the wire, by moving a magnet near the wire, or by changing a current in a nearby wire."
12847,Let’s consider the simple machine of Fig.
12848,"16–1 again, only now, instead of putting a current through the wire to make it turn, let’s turn the loop by an external force, for example by hand or by a waterwheel."
12849,"When the coil rotates, its wires are moving in the magnetic field and we will find an emf in the circuit of the coil."
12850,The motor becomes a generator.
12851,The coil of the generator has an induced emf from its motion.
12852,The amount of the emf is given by a simple rule discovered by Faraday.
12853,(We will just state the rule now and wait until later to examine it in detail.)
12854,We will refer to this as “the flux rule.” You see that when the coil of Fig.
12855,"16–1 is rotated, the flux through it changes."
12856,"If we continuously rotate the coil the flux is first positive, then negative, then positive, and so on."
12857,The rate of change of the flux must alternate also.
12858,So there is an alternating emf in the coil.
12859,If we connect the two ends of the coil to outside wires through some sliding contacts—called slip-rings—(just so the wires won’t get twisted) we have an alternating-current generator.
12860,"Or we can also arrange, by means of some sliding contacts, that after every one-half rotation, the connection between the coil ends and the outside wires is reversed, so that when the emf reverses, so do the connections."
12861,Then the pulses of emf will always push currents in the same direction through the external circuit.
12862,We have what is called a direct-current generator.
12863,The machine of Fig.
12864,16–1 is either a motor or a generator.
12865,"The reciprocity between motors and generators is nicely shown by using two identical dc “motors” of the permanent magnet kind, with their coils connected by two copper wires."
12866,"When the shaft of one is turned mechanically, it becomes a generator and drives the other as a motor."
12867,"If the shaft of the second is turned, it becomes the generator and drives the first as a motor."
12868,So here is an interesting example of a new kind of equivalence of nature: motor and generator are equivalent.
12869,"The quantitative equivalence is, in fact, not completely accidental."
12870,It is related to the law of conservation of energy.
12871,"Another example of a device that can operate either to generate emf’s or to respond to emf’s is the receiver of a standard telephone—that is, an “earphone.” The original telephone of Bell consisted of two such “earphones” connected by two long wires."
12872,The basic principle is shown in Fig.
12873,16–4.
12874,A permanent magnet produces a magnetic field in two “yokes” of soft iron and in a thin diaphragm that is moved by sound pressure.
12875,"When the diaphragm moves, it changes the amount of magnetic field in the yokes."
12876,Therefore a coil of wire wound around one of the yokes will have the flux through it changed when a sound wave hits the diaphragm.
12877,So there is an emf in the coil.
12878,"If the ends of the coil are connected to a circuit, a current which is an electrical representation of the sound is set up."
12879,If the ends of the coil of Fig.
12880,"16–4 are connected by two wires to another identical gadget, varying currents will flow in the second coil."
12881,These currents will produce a varying magnetic field and will make a varying attraction on the iron diaphragm.
12882,The diaphragm will wiggle and make sound waves approximately similar to the ones that moved the original diaphragm.
12883,With a few bits of iron and copper the human voice is transmitted over wires!
12884,(The modern home telephone uses a receiver like the one described but uses an improved invention to get a more powerful transmitter.
12885,"It is the “carbon-button microphone,” that uses sound pressure to vary the electric current from a battery.)"
12886,And quite surprisingly the amount of emf induced in the second coil is given by the same “flux rule”: that the emf is equal to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the coil.
12887,"Suppose that we take two coils, each wound around separate bundles of iron sheets (these help to make stronger magnetic fields), as shown in Fig."
12888,16–5.
12889,Now we connect one of the coils—coil (a)—to an alternating-current generator.
12890,The continually changing current produces a continuously varying magnetic field.
12891,This varying field generates an alternating emf in the second coil—coil (b).
12892,"This emf can, for example, produce enough power to light an electric bulb."
12893,"The emf alternates in coil (b) at a frequency which is, of course, the same as the frequency of the original generator."
12894,But the current in coil (b) can be larger or smaller than the current in coil (a).
12895,The current in coil (b) depends on the emf induced in it and on the resistance and inductance of the rest of its circuit.
12896,"The emf can be less than that of the generator if, say, there is little flux change."
12897,"Or the emf in coil (b) can be made much larger than that in the generator by winding coil (b) with many turns, since in a given magnetic field the flux through the coil is then greater."
12898,"(Or if you prefer to look at it another way, the emf is the same in each turn, and since the total emf is the sum of the emf’s of the separate turns, many turns in series produce a large emf.)"
12899,Such a combination of two coils—usually with an arrangement of iron sheets to guide the magnetic fields—is called a transformer.
12900,It can “transform” one emf (also called a “voltage”) to another.
12901,There are also induction effects in a single coil.
12902,"For instance, in the setup in Fig."
12903,"16–5 there is a changing flux not only through coil (b), which lights the bulb, but also through coil (a)."
12904,"The varying current in coil (a) produces a varying magnetic field inside itself and the flux of this field is continually changing, so there is a self-induced emf in coil (a)."
12905,"There is an emf acting on any current when it is building up a magnetic field—or, in general, when its field is changing in any way."
12906,The effect is called self-inductance.
12907,"When we gave “the flux rule” that the emf is equal to the rate of change of the flux linkage, we didn’t specify the direction of the emf."
12908,"There is a simple rule, called Lenz’s rule, for figuring out which way the emf goes: the emf tries to oppose any flux change."
12909,Lenz’s rule can be used to find the direction of the emf in the generator of Fig.
12910,"16–1, or in the transformer winding of Fig."
12911,16–3.
12912,"In particular, if there is a changing current in a single coil (or in any wire) there is a “back” emf in the circuit."
12913,This emf acts on the charges flowing in coil (a) of Fig.
12914,"16–5 to oppose the change in magnetic field, and so in the direction to oppose the change in current."
12915,"It tries to keep the current constant; it is opposite to the current when the current is increasing, and it is in the direction of the current when it is decreasing."
12916,"A current in a self-inductance has “inertia,” because the inductive effects try to keep the flow constant, just as mechanical inertia tries to keep the velocity of an object constant."
12917,Any large electromagnet will have a large self-inductance.
12918,"Suppose that a battery is connected to the coil of a large electromagnet, as in Fig."
12919,"16–6, and that a strong magnetic field has been built up."
12920,(The current reaches a steady value determined by the battery voltage and the resistance of the wire in the coil.)
12921,But now suppose that we try to disconnect the battery by opening the switch.
12922,"If we really opened the circuit, the current would go to zero rapidly, and in doing so it would generate an enormous emf."
12923,In most cases this emf would be large enough to develop an arc across the opening contacts of the switch.
12924,"The high voltage that appears might also damage the insulation of the coil—or you, if you are the person who opens the switch!"
12925,"For these reasons, electromagnets are usually connected in a circuit like the one shown in Fig."
12926,16–6.
12927,"When the switch is opened, the current does not change rapidly but remains steady, flowing instead through the lamp, being driven by the emf from the self-inductance of the coil."
12928,You have probably seen the dramatic demonstration of Lenz’s rule made with the gadget shown in Fig.
12929,16–7.
12930,"It is an electromagnet, just like coil (a) of Fig."
12931,16–5.
12932,An aluminum ring is placed on the end of the magnet.
12933,"When the coil is connected to an alternating-current generator by closing the switch, the ring flies into the air."
12934,"The force comes, of course, from the induced currents in the ring."
12935,The fact that the ring flies away shows that the currents in it oppose the change of the field through it.
12936,"When the magnet is making a north pole at its top, the induced current in the ring is making a downward-pointing north pole."
12937,The ring and the coil are repelled just like two magnets with like poles opposite.
12938,"If a thin radial cut is made in the ring the force disappears, showing that it does indeed come from the currents in the ring."
12939,"If, instead of the ring, we place a disc of aluminum or copper across the end of the electromagnet of Fig."
12940,"16–7, it is also repelled; induced currents circulate in the material of the disc, and again produce a repulsion."
12941,"An interesting effect, similar in origin, occurs with a sheet of a perfect conductor."
12942,In a “perfect conductor” there is no resistance whatever to the current.
12943,"So if currents are generated in it, they can keep going forever."
12944,"In fact, the slightest emf would generate an arbitrarily large current—which really means that there can be no emf’s at all."
12945,"If we have a sheet of a perfect conductor and put an electromagnet next to it, when we turn on the current in the magnet, currents called eddy currents appear in the sheet, so that no magnetic flux enters."
12946,The field lines would look as shown in Fig.
12947,16–8.
12948,"The same thing happens, of course, if we bring a bar magnet near a perfect conductor."
12949,"Since the eddy currents are creating opposing fields, the magnets are repelled from the conductor."
12950,"This makes it possible to suspend a bar magnet in air above a sheet of perfect conductor shaped like a dish, as shown in Fig."
12951,16–9.
12952,The magnet is suspended by the repulsion of the induced eddy currents in the perfect conductor.
12953,"There are no perfect conductors at ordinary temperatures, but some materials become perfect conductors at low enough temperatures."
12954,It is called a superconductor.
12955,If the conductor in Fig.
12956,16–8 is not quite perfect there will be some resistance to flow of the eddy currents.
12957,The currents will tend to die out and the magnet will slowly settle down.
12958,"The eddy currents in an imperfect conductor need an emf to keep them going, and to have an emf the flux must keep changing."
12959,The flux of the magnetic field gradually penetrates the conductor.
12960,"In a normal conductor, there are not only repulsive forces from eddy currents, but there can also be sidewise forces."
12961,"For instance, if we move a magnet sideways along a conducting surface the eddy currents produce a force of drag, because the induced currents are opposing the changing of the location of flux."
12962,Such forces are proportional to the velocity and are like a kind of viscous force.
12963,These effects show up nicely in the apparatus shown in Fig.
12964,16–10.
12965,A square sheet of copper is suspended on the end of a rod to make a pendulum.
12966,The copper swings back and forth between the poles of an electromagnet.
12967,"When the magnet is turned on, the pendulum motion is suddenly arrested."
12968,"As the metal plate enters the gap of the magnet, there is a current induced in the plate which acts to oppose the change in flux through the plate."
12969,"If the sheet were a perfect conductor, the currents would be so great that they would push the plate out again—it would bounce back."
12970,"With a copper plate there is some resistance in the plate, so the currents at first bring the plate almost to a dead stop as it starts to enter the field."
12971,"Then, as the currents die down, the plate slowly settles to rest in the magnetic field."
12972,The nature of the eddy currents in the copper pendulum is shown in Fig.
12973,16–11.
12974,The strength and geometry of the currents are quite sensitive to the shape of the plate.
12975,"If, for instance, the copper plate is replaced by one which has several narrow slots cut in it, as shown in Fig."
12976,"16–12, the eddy-current effects are drastically reduced."
12977,The pendulum swings through the magnetic field with only a small retarding force.
12978,"The reason is that the currents in each section of the copper have less flux to drive them, so the effects of the resistance of each loop are greater."
12979,The currents are smaller and the drag is less.
12980,The viscous character of the force is seen even more clearly if a sheet of copper is placed between the poles of the magnet of Fig.
12981,16–10 and then released.
12982,It doesn’t fall; it just sinks slowly downward.
12983,The eddy currents exert a strong resistance to the motion—just like the viscous drag in honey.
12984,"If, instead of dragging a conductor past a magnet, we try to rotate it in a magnetic field, there will be a resistive torque from the same effects."
12985,"Alternatively, if we rotate a magnet—end over end—near a conducting plate or ring, the ring is dragged around; currents in the ring will create a torque that tends to rotate the ring with the magnet."
12986,A field just like that of a rotating magnet can be made with an arrangement of coils such as is shown in Fig.
12987,16–13.
12988,"We take a torus of iron (that is, a ring of iron like a doughnut) and wind six coils on it."
12989,"If we put a current, as shown in part (a), through windings (1) and (4), there will be a magnetic field in the direction shown in the figure."
12990,"If we now switch the current to windings (2) and (5), the magnetic field will be in a new direction, as shown in part (b) of the figure."
12991,"Continuing the process, we get the sequence of fields shown in the rest of the figure."
12992,"If the process is done smoothly, we have a “rotating” magnetic field."
12993,"We can easily get the required sequence of currents by connecting the coils to a three-phase power line, which provides just such a sequence of currents."
12994,“Three-phase power” is made in a generator using the principle of Fig.
12995,"When the coils are rotated as a unit, the emf is a maximum in one, then in the next, and so on in a regular sequence."
12996,There are many practical advantages of three-phase power.
12997,One of them is the possibility of making a rotating magnetic field.
12998,"The torque produced on a conductor by such a rotating field is easily shown by standing a metal ring on an insulating table just above the torus, as shown in Fig."
12999,16–14.
13000,The rotating field causes the ring to spin about a vertical axis.
13001,The basic elements seen here are quite the same as those at play in a large commercial three-phase induction motor.
13002,Another form of induction motor is shown in Fig.
13003,16–15.
13004,The arrangement shown is not suitable for a practical high-efficiency motor but will illustrate the principle.
13005,"If we have just these two components, as shown in part (a) of the figure, we do not yet have a motor."
13006,"There are eddy currents in the disc, but they are symmetric and there is no torque."
13007,(There will be some heating of the disc due to the induced currents.)
13008,"If we now cover only one-half of the magnet pole with an aluminum plate, as shown in part (b) of the figure, the disc begins to rotate, and we have a motor."
13009,The operation depends on two eddy-current effects.
13010,"First, the eddy currents in the aluminum plate oppose the change of flux through it, so the magnetic field above the plate always lags the field above that half of the pole which is not covered."
13011,This so-called “shaded-pole” effect produces a field which in the “shaded” region varies much like that in the “unshaded” region except that it is delayed a constant amount in time.
13012,The whole effect is as if there were a magnet only half as wide which is continually being moved from the unshaded region toward the shaded one.
13013,Then the varying fields interact with the eddy currents in the disc to produce the torque on it.
13014,"When Faraday first made public his remarkable discovery that a changing magnetic flux produces an emf, he was asked (as anyone is asked when he discovers a new fact of nature), “What is the use of it?” All he had found was the oddity that a tiny current was produced when he moved a wire near a magnet."
13015,Of what possible “use” could that be?
13016,His answer was: “What is the use of a newborn baby?”
13017,Yet think of the tremendous practical applications his discovery has led to.
13018,What we have been describing are not just toys but examples chosen in most cases to represent the principle of some practical machine.
13019,"For instance, the rotating ring in the turning field is an induction motor."
13020,"There are, of course, some differences between it and a practical induction motor."
13021,The ring has a very small torque; it can be stopped with your hand.
13022,"For a good motor, things have to be put together more intimately: there shouldn’t be so much “wasted” magnetic field out in the air."
13023,"First, the field is concentrated by using iron."
13024,"We have not discussed how iron does that, but iron can make the magnetic field tens of thousands of times stronger than copper coils alone could do."
13025,"Second, the gaps between the pieces of iron are made small; to do that, some iron is even built into the rotating ring."
13026,"Everything is arranged so as to get the greatest forces and the greatest efficiency—that is, conversion of electrical power to mechanical power—until the “ring” can no longer be held still by your hand."
13027,This problem of closing the gaps and making the thing work in the most practical way is engineering.
13028,"It requires serious study of design problems, although there are no new basic principles from which the forces are obtained."
13029,But there is a long way to go from the basic principles to a practical and economic design.
13030,Yet it is just such careful engineering design that has made possible such a tremendous thing as Boulder Dam and all that goes with it.
13031,What is Boulder Dam?
13032,A huge river is stopped by a concrete wall.
13033,But what a wall it is!
13034,Shaped with a perfect curve that is very carefully worked out so that the least possible amount of concrete will hold back a whole river.
13035,It thickens at the bottom in that wonderful shape that the artists like but that the engineers can appreciate because they know that such thickening is related to the increase of pressure with the depth of the water.
13036,But we are getting away from electricity.
13037,Then the water of the river is diverted into a huge pipe.
13038,That’s a nice engineering accomplishment in itself.
13039,The pipe feeds the water into a “waterwheel”—a huge turbine—and makes wheels turn.
13040,(Another engineering feat.)
13041,But why turn wheels?
13042,"They are coupled to an exquisitely intricate mess of copper and iron, all twisted and interwoven."
13043,With two parts—one that turns and one that doesn’t.
13044,"All a complex intermixture of a few materials, mostly iron and copper but also some paper and shellac for insulation."
13045,A revolving monster thing.
13046,A generator.
13047,Somewhere out of the mess of copper and iron come a few special pieces of copper.
13048,"The dam, the turbine, the iron, the copper, all put there to make something special happen to a few bars of copper—an emf."
13049,Then the copper bars go a little way and circle for several times around another piece of iron in a transformer; then their job is done.
13050,But around that same piece of iron curls another cable of copper which has no direct connection whatsoever to the bars from the generator; they have just been influenced because they passed near it—to get their emf.
13051,The transformer converts the power from the relatively low voltages required for the efficient design of the generator to the very high voltages that are best for efficient transmission of electrical energy over long cables.
13052,"And everything must be enormously efficient—there can be no waste, no loss."
13053,Why?
13054,The power for a metropolis is going through.
13055,If a small fraction were lost—one or two percent—think of the energy left behind!
13056,"If one percent of the power were left in the transformer, that energy would need to be taken out somehow."
13057,"If it appeared as heat, it would quickly melt the whole thing."
13058,"There is, of course, some small inefficiency, but all that is required are a few pumps which circulate some oil through a radiator to keep the transformer from heating up."
13059,"Out of the Boulder Dam come a few dozen rods of copper—long, long, long rods of copper perhaps the thickness of your wrist that go for hundreds of miles in all directions."
13060,Small rods of copper carrying the power of a giant river.
13061,"Then the rods are split to make more rods … then to more transformers … sometimes to great generators which recreate the current in another form … sometimes to engines turning for big industrial purposes … to more transformers … then more splitting and spreading … until finally the river is spread throughout the whole city—turning motors, making heat, making light, working gadgetry."
13062,"Large motors for rolling steel, or tiny motors for a dentist’s drill."
13063,"Thousands of little wheels, turning in response to the turning of the big wheel at Boulder Dam."
13064,"Stop the big wheel, and all the wheels stop; the lights go out."
13065,They really are connected.
13066,Yet there is more.
13067,"The same phenomena that take the tremendous power of the river and spread it through the countryside, until a few drops of the river are running the dentist’s drill, come again into the building of extremely fine instruments … for the detection of incredibly small amounts of current … for the transmission of voices, music, and pictures … for computers … for automatic machines of fantastic precision."
13068,"If some future archaeologist uncovers Boulder Dam, we may guess that he would admire the beauty of its curves."
13069,But also the explorers from some great future civilizations will look at the generators and transformers and say: “Notice that every iron piece has a beautifully efficient shape.
13070,Think of the thought that has gone into every piece of copper!”
13071,This is the power of engineering and the careful design of our electrical technology.
13072,There has been created in the generator something which exists nowhere else in nature.
13073,It is true that there are forces of induction in other places.
13074,Certainly in some places around the sun and stars there are effects of electromagnetic induction.
13075,Perhaps also (though it’s not certain) the magnetic field of the earth is maintained by an analog of an electric generator that operates on circulating currents in the interior of the earth.
13076,But nowhere have there been pieces put together with moving parts to generate electrical power as is done in the generator—with great efficiency and regularity.
13077,"You may think that designing electric generators is no longer an interesting subject, that it is a dead subject because they are all designed."
13078,Almost perfect generators or motors can be taken from a shelf.
13079,"Even if this were true, we can admire the wonderful accomplishment of a problem solved to near perfection."
13080,But there remain as many unfinished problems.
13081,Even generators and transformers are returning as problems.
13082,It is likely that the whole field of low temperatures and superconductors will soon be applied to the problem of electric power distribution.
13083,"With a radically new factor in the problem, new optimum designs will have to be created."
13084,Power networks of the future may have little resemblance to those of today.
13085,You can see that there is an endless number of applications and problems that one could take up while studying the laws of induction.
13086,The study of the design of electrical machinery is a life work in itself.
13087,"We cannot go very far in that direction, but we should be aware of the fact that when we have discovered the law of induction, we have suddenly connected our theory to an enormous practical development."
13088,"We must, however, leave that subject to the engineers and applied scientists who are interested in working out the details of particular applications."
13089,"Physics only supplies the base—the basic principles that apply, no matter what."
13090,"(We have not yet completed the base, because we have yet to consider in detail the properties of iron and of copper."
13091,Physics has something to say about these as we will see a little later!)
13092,Modern electrical technology began with Faraday’s discoveries.
13093,The useless baby developed into a prodigy and changed the face of the earth in ways its proud father could never have imagined.
13094,In the last chapter we described many phenomena which show that the effects of induction are quite complicated and interesting.
13095,Now we want to discuss the fundamental principles which govern these effects.
13096,We have already defined the emf in a conducting circuit as the total accumulated force on the charges throughout the length of the loop.
13097,"More specifically, it is the tangential component of the force per unit charge, integrated along the wire once around the circuit."
13098,"This quantity is equal, therefore, to the total work done on a single charge that travels once around the circuit."
13099,"We have also given the “flux rule,” which says that the emf is equal to the rate at which the magnetic flux through such a conducting circuit is changing."
13100,Let’s see if we can understand why that might be.
13101,"First, we’ll consider a case in which the flux changes because a circuit is moved in a steady field."
13102,In Fig.
13103,17–1 we show a simple loop of wire whose dimensions can be changed.
13104,"The loop has two parts, a fixed U-shaped part (a) and a movable crossbar (b) that can slide along the two legs of the U."
13105,"There is always a complete circuit, but its area is variable."
13106,Suppose we now place the loop in a uniform magnetic field with the plane of the U perpendicular to the field.
13107,"According to the rule, when the crossbar is moved there should be in the loop an emf that is proportional to the rate of change of the flux through the loop."
13108,This emf will cause a current in the loop.
13109,We will assume that there is enough resistance in the wire that the currents are small.
13110,Then we can neglect any magnetic field from this current.
13111,The argument just given can be extended to any case where there is a fixed magnetic field and the wires are moved.
13112,"One can prove, in general, that for any circuit whose parts move in a fixed magnetic field the emf is the time derivative of the flux, regardless of the shape of the circuit."
13113,"On the other hand, what happens if the loop is stationary and the magnetic field is changed?"
13114,We cannot deduce the answer to this question from the same argument.
13115,It was Faraday’s discovery—from experiment—that the “flux rule” is still correct no matter why the flux changes.
13116,"Faraday’s observations led to the discovery that electric and magnetic fields are related by a new law: in a region where the magnetic field is changing with time, electric fields are generated."
13117,It is this electric field which drives the electrons around the wire—and so is responsible for the emf in a stationary circuit when there is a changing magnetic flux.
13118,"It was discovered by Faraday but was first written in differential form by Maxwell, as one of his equations."
13119,Let’s see how this equation gives the “flux rule” for circuits.
13120,"The integral on the left is the emf, and that on the right is the negative rate of change of the flux linked by the circuit."
13121,So Eq.
13122,(17.1) applied to a fixed circuit is equivalent to the “flux rule.”
13123,So the “flux rule”—that the emf in a circuit is equal to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the circuit—applies whether the flux changes because the field changes or because the circuit moves (or both).
13124,The two possibilities—“circuit moves” or “field changes”—are not distinguished in the statement of the rule.
13125,We know of no other place in physics where such a simple and accurate general principle requires for its real understanding an analysis in terms of two different phenomena.
13126,Usually such a beautiful generalization is found to stem from a single deep underlying principle.
13127,"Nevertheless, in this case there does not appear to be any such profound implication."
13128,We have to understand the “rule” as the combined effects of two quite separate phenomena.
13129,We must look at the “flux rule” in the following way.
13130,In moving wires there is the force from the second term.
13131,"They are independent effects, but the emf around the loop of wire is always equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux through it."
13132,"We will now give some examples, due in part to Faraday, which show the importance of keeping clearly in mind the distinction between the two effects responsible for induced emf’s."
13133,Our examples involve situations to which the “flux rule” cannot be applied—either because there is no wire at all or because the path taken by induced currents moves about within an extended volume of a conductor.
13134,"Now we will describe a situation in which the flux through a circuit does not change, but there is nevertheless an emf."
13135,Figure 17–2 shows a conducting disc which can be rotated on a fixed axis in the presence of a magnetic field.
13136,One contact is made to the shaft and another rubs on the outer periphery of the disc.
13137,A circuit is completed through a galvanometer.
13138,"As the disc rotates, the “circuit,” in the sense of the place in space where the currents are, is always the same."
13139,But the part of the “circuit” in the disc is in material which is moving.
13140,"Although the flux through the “circuit” is constant, there is still an emf, as can be observed by the deflection of the galvanometer."
13141,"Now we consider, as an opposite example, a somewhat unusual situation in which the flux through a “circuit” (again in the sense of the place where the current is) changes but where there is no emf."
13142,"Imagine two metal plates with slightly curved edges, as shown in Fig."
13143,"17–3, placed in a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to their surfaces."
13144,"Each plate is connected to one of the terminals of a galvanometer, as shown."
13145,"If we imagine the “circuit” to be completed through the plates on the dotted line shown in the figure, the magnetic flux through this circuit changes by a large amount as the plates are rocked back and forth."
13146,The “flux rule” does not work in this case.
13147,It must be applied to circuits in which the material of the circuit remains the same.
13148,"When the material of the circuit is changing, we must return to the basic laws."
13149,"We have said that the electromotive force generated by a changing magnetic field can exist even without conductors; that is, there can be magnetic induction without wires."
13150,We may still imagine an electromotive force around an arbitrary mathematical curve in space.
13151,"Faraday’s law says that this line integral is equal to minus the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the closed curve, Eq."
13152,(17.3).
13153,"As an example of the effect of such an induced electric field, we want now to consider the motion of an electron in a changing magnetic field."
13154,"We imagine a magnetic field which, everywhere on a plane, points in a vertical direction, as shown in Fig."
13155,17–4.
13156,"The magnetic field is produced by an electromagnet, but we will not worry about the details."
13157,"For our example we will imagine that the magnetic field is symmetric about some axis, i.e., that the strength of the magnetic field will depend only on the distance from the axis."
13158,The magnetic field is also varying with time.
13159,We now imagine an electron that is moving in this field on a path that is a circle of constant radius with its center at the axis of the field.
13160,(We will see later how this motion can be arranged.)
13161,"Because of the symmetry, this electric field will have the same value everywhere on the circle."
13162,"The magnetic flux must, in general, be obtained from an integral."
13163,"For the circular orbit we have assumed, the electric force on the electron is always in the direction of its motion, so its total momentum will be increasing at the rate given by Eq."
13164,(17.5).
13165,Combining Eqs.
13166,The operation of a betatron—a machine for accelerating electrons to high energies—is based on this idea.
13167,"To see how the betatron operates in detail, we must now examine how the electron can be constrained to move on a circle."
13168,We have discussed in Chapter 11 of Vol.
13169,I the principle involved.
13170,In the betatron this transverse force causes the electron to move in a circular orbit of constant radius.
13171,"We can find out what the magnetic field at the orbit must be by using again the relativistic equation of motion, but this time, for the transverse component of the force."
13172,In the betatron (see Fig.
13173,"(17.7), and if the electron is to continue to move in its proper circle, Eq."
13174,(17.11) must continue to hold as the momentum of the electron increases.
13175,Comparing Eq.
13176,(17.11) with Eq.
13177,"In these circumstances, as the energy of the particle is increased by the induced electric field the magnetic field at the orbit increases at just the rate required to keep the particle moving in a circle."
13178," The betatron is used to accelerate electrons to energies of tens of millions of volts, or even to hundreds of millions of volts."
13179,"However, it becomes impractical for the acceleration of electrons to energies much higher than a few hundred million volts for several reasons."
13180,One of them is the practical difficulty of attaining the required high average value for the magnetic field inside the orbit.
13181,Another is that Eq.
13182,"(17.6) is no longer correct at very high energies because it does not include the loss of energy from the particle due to its radiation of electromagnetic energy (the so-called synchrotron radiation discussed in Chapter 34, Vol."
13183,I).
13184,"For these reasons, the acceleration of electrons to the highest energies—to many billions of electron volts—is accomplished by means of a different kind of machine, called a synchrotron."
13185, We would now like to describe for you an apparent paradox.
13186,"A paradox is a situation which gives one answer when analyzed one way, and a different answer when analyzed another way, so that we are left in somewhat of a quandary as to actually what should happen."
13187,"Of course, in physics there are never any real paradoxes because there is only one correct answer; at least we believe that nature will act in only one way (and that is the right way, naturally)."
13188,So in physics a paradox is only a confusion in our own understanding.
13189,Here is our paradox.
13190,Imagine that we construct a device like that shown in Fig.
13191,17–5.
13192,"There is a thin, circular plastic disc supported on a concentric shaft with excellent bearings, so that it is quite free to rotate."
13193,On the disc is a coil of wire in the form of a short solenoid concentric with the axis of rotation.
13194,Near the edge of the disc and spaced uniformly around its circumference are a number of small metal spheres insulated from each other and from the solenoid by the plastic material of the disc.
13195,"Everything is quite stationary, and the disc is at rest."
13196,"Suppose now that by some accident—or by prearrangement—the current in the solenoid is interrupted, without, however, any intervention from the outside."
13197,"So long as the current continued, there was a magnetic flux through the solenoid more or less parallel to the axis of the disc."
13198,"When the current is interrupted, this flux must go to zero."
13199,"There will, therefore, be an electric field induced which will circulate around in circles centered at the axis."
13200,The charged spheres on the perimeter of the disc will all experience an electric field tangential to the perimeter of the disc.
13201,This electric force is in the same sense for all the charges and so will result in a net torque on the disc.
13202,"From these arguments we would expect that as the current in the solenoid disappears, the disc would begin to rotate."
13203,"If we knew the moment of inertia of the disc, the current in the solenoid, and the charges on the small spheres, we could compute the resulting angular velocity."
13204,But we could also make a different argument.
13205,"Using the principle of the conservation of angular momentum, we could say that the angular momentum of the disc with all its equipment is initially zero, and so the angular momentum of the assembly should remain zero."
13206,There should be no rotation when the current is stopped.
13207,Which argument is correct?
13208,Will the disc rotate or will it not?
13209,We will leave this question for you to think about.
13210,"We should warn you that the correct answer does not depend on any nonessential feature, such as the asymmetric position of a battery, for example."
13211,"In fact, you can imagine an ideal situation such as the following: The solenoid is made of superconducting wire through which there is a current."
13212,"After the disc has been carefully placed at rest, the temperature of the solenoid is allowed to rise slowly."
13213,"When the temperature of the wire reaches the transition temperature between superconductivity and normal conductivity, the current in the solenoid will be brought to zero by the resistance of the wire."
13214,"The flux will, as before, fall to zero, and there will be an electric field around the axis."
13215,"We should also warn you that the solution is not easy, nor is it a trick."
13216,"When you figure it out, you will have discovered an important principle of electromagnetism."
13217,In the remainder of this chapter we apply the principles of Section 17–1 to analyze a number of the phenomena discussed in Chapter 16.
13218,We first look in more detail at the alternating-current generator.
13219,Such a generator consists basically of a coil of wire rotating in a uniform magnetic field.
13220,The same result can also be achieved by a fixed coil in a magnetic field whose direction rotates in the manner described in the last chapter.
13221,We will consider only the former case.
13222,Suppose we have a circular coil of wire which can be turned on an axis along one of its diameters.
13223,"Let this coil be located in a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the axis of rotation, as in Fig."
13224,17–6.
13225,We also imagine that the two ends of the coil are brought to external connections through some kind of sliding contacts.
13226,"Due to the rotation of the coil, the magnetic flux through it will be changing."
13227,The circuit of the coil will therefore have an emf in it.
13228,Each turn of the coil will have an emf equal to the rate of change of this flux.
13229,Such a varying potential difference is called an alternating voltage.
13230,"Since there is an electric field between the wires, they must be electrically charged."
13231,It is clear that the emf of the generator has pushed some excess charges out to the wire until the electric field from them is strong enough to exactly counterbalance the induction force.
13232,There is also another difference from an electrostatic situation.
13233,"If we connect the generator to an external circuit that permits passage of a current, we find that the emf does not permit the wires to be discharged but continues to provide charge to the wires as current is drawn from them, attempting to keep the wires always at the same potential difference."
13234,"Since the emf has a sinusoidal time variation, so also does the current."
13235,17–7.
13236,We can also see that the emf determines how much energy is supplied by the generator.
13237,"When there is a current in the coil of the generator, there will also be mechanical forces on it."
13238,The magnetic moment is the current in the coil times its area.
13239,All of the mechanical energy used up in the generator appears as electrical energy in the circuit.
13240,"As another example of the currents and forces due to an induced emf, let’s analyze what happens in the setup described in Section 17–1, and shown in Fig."
13241,17–1.
13242,There are two parallel wires and a sliding crossbar located in a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the parallel wires.
13243,"Now let’s assume that the “bottom” of the U (the left side in the figure) is made of wires of high resistance, while the two side wires are made of a good conductor like copper—then we don’t need to worry about the change of the circuit resistance as the crossbar is moved."
13244,"The direction of the force, as you can easily see, is opposite to its velocity."
13245,"Such a “velocity-proportional” force, which is like the force of viscosity, is found whenever induced currents are produced by moving conductors in a magnetic field."
13246,"The examples of eddy currents we gave in the last chapter also produced forces on the conductors proportional to the velocity of the conductor, even though such situations, in general, give a complicated distribution of currents which is difficult to analyze."
13247,It is often convenient in the design of mechanical systems to have damping forces which are proportional to the velocity.
13248,Eddy-current forces provide one of the most convenient ways of getting such a velocity-dependent force.
13249,An example of the application of such a force is found in the conventional domestic wattmeter.
13250,In the wattmeter there is a thin aluminum disc that rotates between the poles of a permanent magnet.
13251,This disc is driven by a small electric motor whose torque is proportional to the power being consumed in the electrical circuit of the house.
13252,"Because of the eddy-current forces in the disc, there is a resistive force proportional to the velocity."
13253,"In equilibrium, the velocity is therefore proportional to the rate of consumption of electrical energy."
13254,"By means of a counter attached to the rotating disc, a record is kept of the number of revolutions it makes."
13255,"This count is an indication of the total energy consumption, i.e., the number of watthours used."
13256,We may also point out that Eq.
13257,"(17.22) shows that the force from induced currents—that is, any eddy-current force—is inversely proportional to the resistance."
13258,"The force will be larger, the better the conductivity of the material."
13259,"The reason, of course, is that an emf produces more current if the resistance is low, and the stronger currents represent greater mechanical forces."
13260,We can also see from our formulas how mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy.
13261,The rate at which work is done in moving the conducting crossbar is the force on the bar times its velocity.
13262,Using Eq.
13263,(17.19) and (17.20).
13264,Again the mechanical work appears as electrical energy.
13265,We now want to consider a situation in which there are fixed coils of wire but changing magnetic fields.
13266,"When we described the production of magnetic fields by currents, we considered only the case of steady currents."
13267,"But so long as the currents are changed slowly, the magnetic field will at each instant be nearly the same as the magnetic field of a steady current."
13268,We will assume in the discussion of this section that the currents are always varying sufficiently slowly that this is true.
13269,In Fig.
13270,17–8 is shown an arrangement of two coils which demonstrates the basic effects responsible for the operation of a transformer.
13271,We will now calculate this induced emf.
13272,"Since for any coil its field is proportional to its current, the same kind of result would be obtained for any two coils of wire."
13273,Their values would depend on the shapes of the coils and their relative positions.
13274,"Suppose that we wish to find the mutual inductance between any two arbitrary coils—for example, those shown in Fig."
13275,17–9.
13276,(See Fig.
13277,17–9.)
13278,Combining Eqs.
13279,We may therefore take it out of the integrals.
13280,"It depends on a kind of average separation of the two circuits, with the average weighted most for parallel segments of the two coils."
13281,Our equation can be used for calculating the mutual inductance of any two circuits of arbitrary shape.
13282,We have therefore shown that the two coefficients are identical.
13283,In discussing the induced electromotive forces in the two coils of Figs.
13284,"17–8 or 17–9, we have considered only the case in which there was a current in one coil or the other."
13285,"If there are currents in the two coils simultaneously, the magnetic flux linking either coil will be the sum of the two fluxes which would exist separately, because the law of superposition applies for magnetic fields."
13286,"The emf in either coil will therefore be proportional not only to the change of the current in the other coil, but also to the change in the current of the coil itself."
13287,"The self-induced emf will, of course, exist even if we have only one coil."
13288,The emf will be proportional to the rate of change of the current in it.
13289,"For a single coil, it is usual to adopt the convention that the emf and the current are considered positive if they are in the same direction."
13290,"Since any coil has a self-inductance which opposes the change in current, the current in the coil has a kind of inertia."
13291,"In fact, if we wish to change the current in a coil we must overcome this inertia by connecting the coil to some external voltage source such as a battery or a generator, as shown in the schematic diagram of Fig."
13292,17–10(a).
13293,This equation has the same form as Newton’s law of motion for a particle in one dimension.
13294,17–10(b).
13295,We can make the following table of corresponding quantities.
13296,The whole circuit may be standing still and have no momentum.
13297,But there we have a surprise.
13298,"Therefore, in the case of the energy, the quantities not only correspond mathematically, but also have the same physical meaning as well."
13299,We may see this in more detail as follows.
13300,As we found in Eq.
13301,Applying the same arguments to a pair of coils such as those in Figs.
13302,"We might at first expect that we could use the principle of virtual work, by taking the change in the energy of Eq."
13303,(17.38).
13304,We can now understand that these sources must supply energy against the induced emf’s in the coils as they are moved.
13305,"If we wish to apply the principle of virtual work correctly, we must also include these energies."
13306,It is clear that the energy of two coils must be positive.
13307,"If we begin with zero currents in the coils and increase these currents to some values, we have been adding energy to the system."
13308,"If not, the currents would spontaneously increase with release of energy to the rest of the world—an unlikely thing to happen!"
13309,"Now our energy equation, Eq."
13310,(17.40) is zero.
13311,"If the energy is to be positive, the last term in (17.40) must be greater than zero."
13312,"If most of the flux from one coil links the other coil, the coefficient of coupling is near one; we say the coils are “tightly coupled.” If the coils are far apart or otherwise arranged so that there is very little mutual flux linkage, the coefficient of coupling is near zero and the mutual inductance is very small."
13313,"For calculating the mutual inductance of two coils, we have given in Eq."
13314,(17.30) a formula which is a double line integral around the two circuits.
13315,We might think that the same formula could be used to get the self-inductance of a single coil by carrying out both line integrals around the same coil.
13316,The self-inductance obtained from this formula is infinite.
13317,The reason is that this formula is an approximation that is valid only when the cross sections of the wires of the two circuits are small compared with the distance from one circuit to the other.
13318,"Clearly, this approximation doesn’t hold for a single coil."
13319,"It is, in fact, true that the inductance of a single coil tends logarithmically to infinity as the diameter of its wire is made smaller and smaller."
13320,"We must, then, look for a different way of calculating the self-inductance of a single coil."
13321,It is necessary to take into account the distribution of the currents within the wires because the size of the wire is an important parameter.
13322,"We should therefore ask not what is the inductance of a “circuit,” but what is the inductance of a distribution of conductors."
13323,Perhaps the easiest way to find this inductance is to make use of the magnetic energy.
13324,(17.44) to get the energy.
13325,The formula of Eq.
13326,Equation (17.44) for the energy of a current distribution can be put in a quite different form which is sometimes more convenient for calculation.
13327,"Also, as we will see later, it is a form that is important because it is more generally valid."
13328,"In the energy equation, Eq."
13329,(17.46).
13330,"If you work out the other five terms, you will see that Eq."
13331,(17.47) is indeed equivalent to Eq.
13332,(17.46).
13333,One reason for emphasizing these two energy formulas is that sometimes they are more convenient to use.
13334,Let’s see how this works by finding the self-inductance of a long solenoid.
13335,"In this chapter we come back to the complete set of the four
Maxwell equations that we took as our starting point in
Chapter 1."
13336,"Until now, we have been studying Maxwell’s
equations in bits and pieces; it is time to add one final piece, and to
put them all together."
13337,"We will then have the complete and correct story
for electromagnetic fields that may be changing with time in any way."
13338,"Anything said in this chapter that contradicts something said earlier is
true and what was said earlier is false—because what was said earlier
applied to such special situations as, for instance, steady currents or
fixed charges."
13339,"Although we have been very careful to point out the
restrictions whenever we wrote an equation, it is easy to forget all of
the qualifications and to learn too well the wrong equations."
13340,"Now we are
ready to give the whole truth, with no qualifications (or almost none)."
13341,"The complete Maxwell equations are written in Table 18–1,
in words as well as in mathematical symbols."
13342,"The fact that the words
are equivalent to the equations should by this time be familiar—you
should be able to translate back and forth from one form to the other."
13343,"In dynamic as well as in
static fields, Gauss’ law is always valid."
13344,"The third
equation is the corresponding general law for magnetic fields."
13345,It also is generally true.
13346,"The last equation has
something new."
13347,"We have seen before only the part of it which holds for
steady currents."
13348,"Until Maxwell’s work,
the known laws of electricity and magnetism were
those we have studied in Chapters 3
through 17."
13349,"He then
noticed that there was something strange about Eq."
13350,(18.1).
13351,"If one takes the divergence of this equation, the left-hand side will be
zero, because the divergence of a curl is always zero."
13352,"The flux of current from a closed surface is the decrease of the
charge inside the surface."
13353,"This certainly cannot in general be zero
because we know that the charges can be moved from one place to
another."
13354,"This equation
expresses the very fundamental law that electric charge is
conserved—any flow of charge must come from some supply."
13355,"It was not yet customary in
Maxwell’s time to think in terms of
abstract fields."
13356,"Maxwell
discussed his ideas in terms of a model in
which the vacuum was like an elastic solid."
13357,"He also tried to explain
the meaning of his new equation in terms of the mechanical
model."
13358,"There was much reluctance to accept his theory, first because
of the model, and second because there was at first no experimental
justification."
13359,"Today, we understand better that what counts are the
equations themselves and not the model used to get them."
13360,"We may only
question whether the equations are true or false."
13361,"This is answered by
doing experiments, and untold numbers of experiments have confirmed
Maxwell’s equations."
13362,"If we take away the scaffolding he used to build
it, we find that Maxwell’s
beautiful edifice stands on its own."
13363,"He
brought together all of the laws of electricity and magnetism and made
one complete and beautiful theory."
13364,"Let us show that the extra term is just what is required to straighten
out the difficulty Maxwell
discovered."
13365,"Inserting this equality in
Eq."
13366,"(18.4), we get back Eq."
13367,"(18.2), which we
know is true."
13368,"Conversely, if we accept Maxwell’s equations—and we do
because no one has ever found an experiment that disagrees with
them—we must conclude that charge is always conserved."
13369,"The laws of physics have no answer to the question: “What happens if
a charge is suddenly created at this point—what electromagnetic
effects are produced?” No answer can be given because our equations
say it doesn’t happen."
13370,"If it were to happen, we would need new
laws, but we cannot say what they would be."
13371,"We have not had the chance
to observe how a world without charge conservation behaves."
13372,"According
to our equations, if you suddenly place a charge at some point, you
had to carry it there from somewhere else."
13373,"In that case, we can say
what would happen."
13374,"We can touch on only a few of them
in this chapter."
13375,"As our first example we consider what happens with a spherically
symmetric radial distribution of current."
13376,"Suppose we imagine a little
sphere with radioactive material on it."
13377,"This radioactive material is
squirting out some charged particles."
13378,"(Or we could imagine a large
block of jello with a small hole in the center into which some charge
had been injected with a hypodermic needle and from which the charge
is slowly leaking out.)"
13379,"In either case we would have a current that is
everywhere radially outward."
13380,"We will assume that it has the same
magnitude in all directions."
13381,"We now ask about the magnetic field produced by the currents in this
situation."
13382,18–1.
13383,"There is some current
through this loop, so we might expect to find a magnetic field
circulating in the direction shown."
13384,But we are already in difficulty.
13385,We are saved by Maxwell’s equation.
13386,"It
must be that these two parts just cancel."
13387,Let’s see if that works out.
13388,There is no magnetic field in our example.
13389,"As our second example, we consider the magnetic field of a wire used to
charge a parallel-plate condenser (see Fig."
13390,18–2).
13391,"We would expect that this
current will produce a magnetic field that encircles the wire."
13392,"Surely,
the current close to the plate must produce the normal magnetic
field—it cannot depend on where the current is going."
13393,"We get always the same result until we draw even with the plates of the
condenser."
13394,"Does the magnetic field
disappear?"
13395,That would be quite strange.
13396,18–2(b)].
13397,That is very convenient.
13398,"It is the same result we found in
Eq."
13399,(18.8).
13400,"Integrating over the changing electric field
gives the same magnetic field as does integrating over the current in
the wire."
13401,"Of course, that is just what Maxwell’s equation says."
13402,18–2(b).
13403,IV with either surface.
13404,"From our discussion so far of
Maxwell’s new term, you may have the
impression that it doesn’t add much—that it just fixes up the
equations to agree with what we already expect."
13405,"It is true that if we
just consider Eq."
13406,"IV by itself, nothing particularly new
comes out."
13407,"The words “by itself” are, however,
all-important."
13408,"Maxwell’s
small change in Eq."
13409,"IV, when combined
with the other equations, does indeed produce much that is new and
important."
13410,"Before we take up these matters, however, we want to speak
more about Table 18–1."
13411,"In Table 18–1 we have all that was known of fundamental
classical physics, that is, the physics that was known by
1905."
13412,"Here it all is, in one table."
13413,"With these equations we can
understand the complete realm of classical physics."
13414,"First we have the Maxwell equations—written in both the expanded
form and the short mathematical form."
13415,"Then there is the conservation
of charge, which is even written in parentheses, because the moment we
have the complete Maxwell equations, we can deduce from them the
conservation of charge."
13416,So the table is even a little redundant.
13417,"Next,
we have written the force law, because having all the electric and
magnetic fields doesn’t tell us anything until we know what they do to
charges."
13418,"Finally, having the force doesn’t tell us anything until we
know what happens when a force pushes on something; we need the law of
motion, which is that the force is equal to the rate of change of the
momentum."
13419,(Remember?
13420,We had that in Volume I.)
13421,"If we really want to be complete, we should add one more
law—Newton’s law of gravitation—so we put that at the end."
13422,"Therefore in one small table we have all the fundamental laws of
classical physics—even with room to write them out in words and with
some redundancy."
13423,This is a great moment.
13424,"We have climbed a great
peak."
13425,"We are on the top of K2—we are nearly ready for Mount
Everest, which is quantum mechanics."
13426,"We have climbed the peak of a
“Great Divide,” and now we can go down the other side."
13427,"We have mainly been trying to learn how to understand the
equations."
13428,"Now that we have the whole thing put together, we are going
to study what the equations mean—what new things they say that we
haven’t already seen."
13429,"We’ve been working hard to get up to this
point."
13430,"It has been a great effort, but now we are going to have nice
coasting downhill as we see all the consequences of our
accomplishment."
13431,Now for the new consequences.
13432,"They come from putting together all of
Maxwell’s equations."
13433,"First, let’s see what would happen in a
circumstance which we pick to be particularly simple."
13434,"By assuming that
all the quantities vary only in one coordinate, we will have a
one-dimensional problem."
13435,"The situation is shown in
Fig."
13436,18–3.
13437,"In other words, we have a
situation where there is no current, and then suddenly there is a
uniform sheet of current."
13438,What will happen?
13439,"However, that would mean that the moment we turn on the current,
the magnetic field is suddenly changed from zero to a finite value
everywhere."
13440,But wait!
13441,"If the magnetic field is suddenly changed, it
will produce tremendous electrical effects."
13442,"(If it changes in
any way, there are electrical effects.)"
13443,"So because we moved the
sheet of charge, we make a changing magnetic field, and therefore
electric fields must be generated."
13444,"If there are electric fields
generated, they had to start from zero and change to something
else."
13445,"So through the various equations there is a big
intermixing, and we have to try to solve for all the fields at once."
13446,"By looking at the Maxwell equations alone, it is not easy to see
directly how to get the solution."
13447,"So we will first show you what the
answer is and then verify that it does indeed satisfy the
equations."
13448,"It must be so, because if we make a tiny loop around the
sheet, there is no room for any electric flux to go through it."
13449,"It stays zero for awhile, and then suddenly turns on."
13450,18–4(a).
13451,"Looking again at
Fig."
13452,"(We cannot draw an infinite sheet, so we
have shown only what happens in a finite area.)"
13453,We want now to analyze quantitatively what is happening.
13454,18–6.
13455,Suppose we start with the side view.
13456,"Let’s see if these fields are consistent with Maxwell’s
equations."
13457,18–6.
13458,"You notice that one side of the rectangle is
in the region where there are fields, but one side is in the region
the fields have still not reached."
13459,"There is some magnetic flux through
this loop."
13460,"If it is changing, there should be an emf around it."
13461,"The rate of change of
the area is easy."
13462,(See Fig.
13463,18–6.)
13464,18–5.
13465,18–5.
13466,"Here there are no
currents, so Eq."
13467,The right-hand side of Eq.
13468,From Eqs.
13469,Can such a field as we describe really exist?
13470,"We can see
what will happen by the principle of superposition."
13471,"We had a current
that was zero and then was suddenly turned on."
13472,"We know the solution
for that case."
13473,Now we are going to add another set of fields.
13474,We have a square “pulse” of current.
13475,18–4(b).
13476,18–4.
13477,The combined fields are as shown in part (c) of the figure.
13478,"The fields have “taken off”; they are
propagating freely through space, no longer connected in any way with
the source."
13479,The caterpillar has turned into a butterfly!
13480,How can this bundle of electric and magnetic fields maintain itself?
13481,"They cannot help maintaining
themselves."
13482,Suppose the magnetic field were to disappear.
13483,"There would be
a changing magnetic field which would produce an electric field."
13484,"If this
electric field tries to go away, the changing electric field would
create a magnetic field back again."
13485,"So by a perpetual interplay—by the
swishing back and forth from one field to the other—they must go on
forever."
13486,"It is impossible for them to disappear.1 They maintain
themselves in a kind of a dance—one making the other, the second
making the first—propagating onward through space."
13487,"But let’s go back a
moment."
13488,There was just a constant in the equations.
13489,"(18.14)—say by measuring the force between two unit
charges at rest, using Coulomb’s law."
13490,"(18.15), which we can do, say, by measuring the force
between two unit currents."
13491,"(A unit current means one unit of charge per
second.)"
13492,"When we pass two
of these “unit” currents through two wires, there will be twice as
much “charge” per second in each wire, so the force between two
wires is four times larger."
13493,"When
Maxwell first made this
calculation with his equations, he said that bundles of electric and
magnetic fields should be propagated at this speed."
13494,"He also remarked
on the mysterious coincidence that this was the same as the speed of
light."
13495,"“We can scarcely avoid the inference,” said
Maxwell, “that
light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which
is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.”"
13496,"Maxwell had made one of the
great unifications of physics."
13497,"Before his
time, there was light, and there was electricity and magnetism."
13498,"The
latter two had been unified by the experimental work of
Faraday, Oersted, and Ampère."
13499,"Then, all of a
sudden, light was no longer “something else,” but was only electricity
and magnetism in this new form—little pieces of electric and magnetic
fields which propagate through space on their own."
13500,"Our special
case is a good one—it shows all the main features of electromagnetic
waves."
13501,"Now we would like to do something mathematical; we want to write
Maxwell’s equations in a simpler form."
13502,"You may consider that we are
complicating them, but if you will be patient a little bit, they will
suddenly come out simpler."
13503,"Although by this time you are thoroughly
used to each of the Maxwell equations, there are many pieces that must
all be put together."
13504,That’s what we want to do.
13505,We have talked about that before.)
13506,Therefore that vector is the gradient of something.
13507,"(18.19),
is changed."
13508,"We are not going to do that now; we are
going to make a different choice."
13509,"But we’ll wait a bit before saying
what the choice is, because later it will be clear why the
choice is made."
13510,"(18.16)
and (18.19), so we will have another form of Maxwell’s equations."
13511,We begin by substituting Eq.
13512,Our final equation will be the most complicated.
13513,What a beautiful set of equations!
13514,"We have
another form of the electromagnetic laws exactly equivalent to
Maxwell’s equations, and in many situations they are much simpler to
handle."
13515,"We have, in fact, already solved an equation much like
Eq."
13516,(18.26).
13517,"When we studied sound in
Chapter 47 of Vol."
13518,"Equation (18.26) is the
corresponding wave equation for three dimensions."
13519,"(Although
that is indeed one possible solution.)"
13520,"The fields travel onward through
free space, as in our example at the beginning of the chapter."
13521,"With Maxwell’s
new term in Eq."
13522,"But they are on the other side of the mountain we have
already climbed."
13523,"Now we are ready to cross over to the other side of
the peak."
13524,"Things will look different—we are ready for some new and
beautiful views."
13525,"“When I was in high school, my physics teacher—whose name
was Mr. Bader—called me down one day after physics class and said,
‘You look bored; I want to tell you something interesting.’ Then he told
me something which I found absolutely fascinating, and have, since then,
always found fascinating."
13526,"Every time the subject comes up, I work on it."
13527,"In fact, when I began to prepare this lecture I found myself making more
analyses on the thing."
13528,"Instead of worrying about the lecture, I got
involved in a new problem."
13529,"The subject is this—the principle of least
action."
13530,“Mr.
13531,"Bader told me the following: Suppose you have a particle (in a
gravitational field, for instance) which starts somewhere and moves to
some other point by free motion—you throw it, and it goes up and comes
down (Fig."
13532,19–1).
13533,"It goes from the original place to the
final place in a certain amount of time."
13534,"Now, you try a different
motion."
13535,"Suppose that to get from here to there, it went as shown in
Fig."
13536,19–2 but got there in just the same amount of time.
13537,"Then he said this: If you calculate the kinetic energy at every moment
on the path, take away the potential energy, and integrate it over the
time during the whole path, you’ll find that the number you’ll get is
bigger than that for the actual motion."
13538,“Let me illustrate a little bit better what it means.
13539,"Now I take the kinetic energy minus the potential energy at
every moment along the path and integrate that with respect to time from
the initial time to the final time."
13540,19–3).
13541,"But we
could imagine some other motion that went very high and came up
and down in some peculiar way (Fig."
13542,19–4).
13543,"We can
calculate the kinetic energy minus the potential energy and integrate
for such a path … or for any other path we want."
13544,"The miracle is
that the true path is the one for which that integral is least."
13545,“Let’s try it out.
13546,"First, suppose we take the case of a free particle
for which there is no potential energy at all."
13547,"Then the rule says that
in going from one point to another in a given amount of time, the
kinetic energy integral is least, so it must go at a uniform
speed."
13548,(We know that’s the right answer—to go at a uniform speed.)
13549,Why is that?
13550,"Because if the particle were to go any other way, the
velocities would be sometimes higher and sometimes lower than the
average."
13551,"The average velocity is the same for every case because it
has to get from ‘here’ to ‘there’ in a given amount of time."
13552,"“As an example, say your job is to start from home and get to school
in a given length of time with the car."
13553,"You can do it several ways:
You can accelerate like mad at the beginning and slow down with the
brakes near the end, or you can go at a uniform speed, or you can go
backwards for a while and then go forward, and so on."
13554,"The thing is
that the average speed has got to be, of course, the total distance
that you have gone over the time."
13555,"But if you do anything but go at a
uniform speed, then sometimes you are going too fast and sometimes you
are going too slow."
13556,"Now the mean square of something that
deviates around an average, as you know, is always greater than the
square of the mean; so the kinetic energy integral would always be
higher if you wobbled your velocity than if you went at a uniform
velocity."
13557,"So we see that the integral is a minimum if the velocity is
a constant (when there are no forces)."
13558,"The correct path is shown in 
Fig."
13559,19–5.
13560,"“Now, an object thrown up in a gravitational field does rise faster
first and then slow down."
13561,"That is because there is also the potential
energy, and we must have the least difference of kinetic and
potential energy on the average."
13562,"Because the potential energy rises as
we go up in space, we will get a lower difference if we can get
as soon as possible up to where there is a high potential energy."
13563,"Then
we can take that potential away from the kinetic energy and get a
lower average."
13564,"So it is better to take a path which goes up and gets a
lot of negative stuff from the potential energy (Fig."
13565,19–6).
13566,"“On the other hand, you can’t go up too fast, or too far, because you
will then have too much kinetic energy involved—you have to go very
fast to get way up and come down again in the fixed amount of time
available."
13567,"So you don’t want to go too far up, but you want to go up
some."
13568,"So it turns out that the solution is some kind of balance
between trying to get more potential energy with the least amount of
extra kinetic energy—trying to get the difference, kinetic minus the
potential, as small as possible."
13569,"“That is all my teacher told me, because he was a very good teacher
and knew when to stop talking."
13570,"But I don’t know when to stop
talking."
13571,"So instead of leaving it as an interesting remark, I am going
to horrify and disgust you with the complexities of life by proving
that it is so."
13572,"The kind of mathematical problem we will have is very
difficult and a new kind."
13573,"It is the kinetic energy, minus the potential
energy, integrated over time."
13574,"For each
different possible path you get a different number for this
action."
13575,"Our mathematical problem is to find out for what curve that
number is the least."
13576,"“You say—Oh, that’s just the ordinary calculus of maxima and
minima."
13577,"You calculate the action and just differentiate to find the
minimum."
13578,“But watch out.
13579,"Ordinarily we just have a function of some variable,
and we have to find the value of that variable where the
function is least or most."
13580,"For instance, we have a rod which has been
heated in the middle and the heat is spread around."
13581,"For each point on
the rod we have a temperature, and we must find the point at which
that temperature is largest."
13582,"But now for each path in space we
have a number—quite a different thing—and we have to find the
path in space for which the number is the minimum."
13583,"That is a
completely different branch of mathematics."
13584,"It is not the ordinary
calculus."
13585,"In fact, it is called the calculus of
variations."
13586,“There are many problems in this kind of mathematics.
13587,"For example,
the circle is usually defined as the locus of all points at a constant
distance from a fixed point, but another way of defining a circle is
this: a circle is that curve of given length which encloses the
biggest area."
13588,"Any other curve encloses less area for a given perimeter
than the circle does."
13589,"So if we give the problem: find that curve which
encloses the greatest area for a given perimeter, we would have a
problem of the calculus of variations—a different kind of calculus than you’re used to."
13590,“So we make the calculation for the path of an object.
13591,"Here is the
way we are going to do it."
13592,"The idea is that we imagine that there is a
true path and that any other curve we draw is a false path, so that if
we calculate the action for the false path we will get a value that is
bigger than if we calculate the action for the true path
(Fig."
13593,19–7).
13594,“Problem: Find the true path.
13595,Where is it?
13596,"One way, of course, is to
calculate the action for millions and millions of paths and look at
which one is lowest."
13597,"When you find the lowest one, that’s the true
path."
13598,“That’s a possible way.
13599,But we can do it better than that.
13600,"When we
have a quantity which has a minimum—for instance, in an ordinary
function like the temperature—one of the properties of the minimum
is that if we go away from the minimum in the first order, the
deviation of the function from its minimum value is only second
order."
13601,"At any place else on the curve, if we move a small distance the
value of the function changes also in the first order."
13602,"But at a
minimum, a tiny motion away makes, in the first approximation, no
difference (Fig."
13603,19–8).
13604,“That is what we are going to use to calculate the true path.
13605,"If we
have the true path, a curve which differs only a little bit from it
will, in the first approximation, make no difference in the
action."
13606,"Any difference will be in the second approximation, if we
really have a minimum."
13607,“That is easy to prove.
13608,"If there is a change in the first order when
I deviate the curve a certain way, there is a change in the action
that is proportional to the deviation."
13609,"The change presumably
makes the action greater; otherwise we haven’t got a minimum."
13610,"But then
if the change is proportional to the deviation, reversing the
sign of the deviation will make the action less."
13611,"We would get the
action to increase one way and to decrease the other way."
13612,"The only way
that it could really be a minimum is that in the first
approximation it doesn’t make any change, that the changes are
proportional to the square of the deviations from the true path."
13613,19–9).
13614,"It can
differ in the second order, but in the first order the difference must
be zero."
13615,"Well, not quite."
13616,"With that
condition, we have specified our mathematical problem."
13617,“Now I must write this out in more detail.
13618,“Now the problem is this: Here is a certain integral.
13619,"That
isn’t quite right."
13620,"“The method of solving all problems in the calculus of variations
always uses the same general principle."
13621,"You will
see the great value of that in a minute."
13622,"(There are formulas that tell
you how to do this in some cases without actually calculating, but
they are not general enough to be worth bothering about; the best way
is to calculate it out this way.)"
13623,I can do that by integrating by parts.
13624,"It is always the same in every problem in which derivatives
appear."
13625,“You remember the general principle for integrating by parts.
13626,"Then
I must have the integral from the rest of the integration by parts."
13627,"The
last term is brought down without change."
13628,"“Now comes something which always happens—the integrated part
disappears."
13629,"(In fact, if the integrated part does not disappear, you
restate the principle, adding conditions to make sure it does!)"
13630,"So the integrated term is
zero."
13631,"That’s
obvious, but anyway I’ll show you one kind of proof."
13632,19–10).
13633,"The first term is the mass times acceleration, and the
second is the derivative of the potential energy, which is the force."
13634,"“So, for a conservative system at least, we have demonstrated that
the principle of least action gives the right answer; it says that the
path that has the minimum action is the one satisfying Newton’s law."
13635,"“One remark: I did not prove it was a minimum—maybe it’s a
maximum."
13636,"In fact, it doesn’t really have to be a minimum."
13637,"It is quite
analogous to what we found for the ‘principle of least time’ which we
discussed in optics."
13638,"There also, we said at first it was ‘least’
time."
13639,"It turned out, however, that there were situations in which it
wasn’t the least time."
13640,"The fundamental principle was that for
any first-order variation away from the optical path, the
change in time was zero; it is the same story."
13641,It is not necessarily a ‘minimum.’
13642,"“Next, I remark on some generalizations."
13643,"In the first place, the thing
can be done in three dimensions."
13644,"And
what about the path?"
13645,"The path is some general curve in space, which is
not so easily drawn, but the idea is the same."
13646,"This doesn’t
really complicate things too much, though."
13647,"Since only the
first-order variation has to be zero, we can do the calculation
by three successive shifts."
13648,"We get one
equation."
13649,"Or, of course, in any order that
you want."
13650,"Anyway, you get three equations."
13651,"And, of course, Newton’s
law is really three equations in the three dimensions—one for each
component."
13652,"I think that you can practically see that it is bound to
work, but we will leave you to show for yourself that it will work for
three dimensions."
13653,"“Similarly, the method can be generalized to any number of particles."
13654,"If you have, say, two particles with a force between them, so that there
is a mutual potential energy, then you just add the kinetic energy of
both particles and take the potential energy of the mutual interaction."
13655,And what do you vary?
13656,You vary the paths of both particles.
13657,"Then,
for two particles moving in three dimensions, there are six equations."
13658,And that’s as it should be.
13659,"You follow the same game through, and you get Newton’s
law in three dimensions for any number of particles."
13660,“I have been saying that we get Newton’s law.
13661,"That is not quite true,
because Newton’s law includes nonconservative forces like friction."
13662,"But the principle of least action only works for
conservative systems—where all forces can be gotten from a
potential function."
13663,"You know, however, that on a microscopic level—on
the deepest level of physics—there are no nonconservative forces."
13664,"Nonconservative forces, like friction, appear only because we neglect
microscopic complications—there are just too many particles to
analyze."
13665,"But the fundamental laws can be put in the form
of a principle of least action."
13666,“Let me generalize still further.
13667,"Suppose we ask what happens if the
particle moves relativistically."
13668,"The
question is: Is there a corresponding principle of least action for
the relativistic case?"
13669,There is.
13670,"Of course, we are then including only
electromagnetic forces."
13671,"This action function gives the complete
theory of relativistic motion of a single particle in an
electromagnetic field."
13672,"I will leave to the more ingenious
of you the problem to demonstrate that this action formula does, in
fact, give the correct equations of motion for relativity."
13673,"“It is much more difficult to include also the case with a vector
potential."
13674,The variations get much more complicated.
13675,But I will leave that for you to play with.
13676,"“I would like to emphasize that in the general case, for instance in
the relativistic formula, the action integrand no longer has the form of
the kinetic energy minus the potential energy."
13677,"That’s only true in the
nonrelativistic approximation."
13678,"The question of what the action should be for any particular
case must be determined by some kind of trial and error."
13679,"It is just the
same problem as determining what are the laws of motion in the first
place."
13680,"You just have to fiddle around with the equations that you know
and see if you can get them into the form of the principle of least
action."
13681,“One other point on terminology.
13682,"It is called ‘Hamilton´s first
principal function.’ Now I hate to give a lecture on
‘the-principle-of-least-Hamilton’s-first-principal-function.’ So I call
it ‘the action.’ Also, more and more people are calling it the action."
13683,"You see, historically something else which is not quite as useful was
called the action, but I think it’s more sensible to change to a newer
definition."
13684,"So now you too will call the new function the action, and
pretty soon everybody will call it by that simple name."
13685,"“Now I want to say some things on this subject which are similar to the
discussions I gave about the principle of least time."
13686,"There is quite a
difference in the characteristic of a law which says a certain integral
from one place to another is a minimum—which tells something about the
whole path—and of a law which says that as you go along, there is a
force that makes it accelerate."
13687,"The second way tells how you inch your
way along the path, and the other is a grand statement about the whole
path."
13688,"In the case of light, we talked about the connection of these two."
13689,"Now, I would like to explain why it is true that there are differential
laws when there is a least action principle of this kind."
13690,"The reason is
the following: Consider the actual path in space and time."
13691,19–11).
13692,"Otherwise you could just fiddle
with just that piece of the path and make the whole integral a little
lower."
13693,“So every subsection of the path must also be a minimum.
13694,"And this is
true no matter how short the subsection."
13695,"Therefore, the principle that
the whole path gives a minimum can be stated also by saying that an
infinitesimal section of path also has a curve such that it has a
minimum action."
13696,"The only thing that you have to
discuss is the first-order change in the potential."
13697,"The answer can
only depend on the derivative of the potential and not on the
potential everywhere."
13698,"So the statement about the gross property of the
whole path becomes a statement of what happens for a short section of
the path—a differential statement."
13699,"And this differential statement
only involves the derivatives of the potential, that is, the force at
a point."
13700,"That’s the qualitative explanation of the relation between
the gross law and the differential law."
13701,"“In the case of light we also discussed the question: How does the
particle find the right path?"
13702,"From the differential point of view, it
is easy to understand."
13703,"Every moment it gets an acceleration and knows
only what to do at that instant."
13704,"But all your instincts on cause and
effect go haywire when you say that the particle decides to take the
path that is going to give the minimum action."
13705,"Does it ‘smell’ the
neighboring paths to find out whether or not they have more action?"
13706,"In
the case of light, when we put blocks in the way so that the photons
could not test all the paths, we found that they couldn’t figure out
which way to go, and we had the phenomenon of diffraction."
13707,“Is the same thing true in mechanics?
13708,"Is it true that the particle
doesn’t just ‘take the right path’ but that it looks at all the other
possible trajectories?"
13709,"And if by having things in the way, we don’t
let it look, that we will get an analog of diffraction?"
13710,"The miracle of
it all is, of course, that it does just that."
13711,"That’s what the laws of
quantum mechanics say."
13712,"So our principle of least action is
incompletely stated."
13713,"It isn’t that a particle takes the path of least
action but that it smells all the paths in the neighborhood and
chooses the one that has the least action by a method analogous to the
one by which light chose the shortest time."
13714,"You remember that the way
light chose the shortest time was this: If it went on a path that took
a different amount of time, it would arrive at a different phase."
13715,"And
the total amplitude at some point is the sum of contributions of
amplitude for all the different ways the light can arrive."
13716,"All the
paths that give wildly different phases don’t add up to anything."
13717,"But
if you can find a whole sequence of paths which have phases almost all
the same, then the little contributions will add up and you get a
reasonable total amplitude to arrive."
13718,"The important path becomes the
one for which there are many nearby paths which give the same phase."
13719,“It is just exactly the same thing for quantum mechanics.
13720,"The
total amplitude can be written as the sum of the amplitudes for each
possible path—for each way of arrival."
13721,Then we add them all together.
13722,"What do we take
for the amplitude for each path?"
13723,"Our action integral tells us what the
amplitude for a single path ought to be."
13724,"It is the constant that determines when quantum
mechanics is important."
13725,One path contributes a certain amplitude.
13726,"Only those paths will
be the important ones."
13727,"The fact that quantum mechanics can be
formulated in this way was discovered in 1942 by a student of that same
teacher, Bader, I spoke of at the beginning of this lecture."
13728,"[Quantum
mechanics was originally formulated by giving a differential equation
for the amplitude (Schrödinger) and also by some other matrix mathematics
(Heisenberg).]"
13729,“Now I want to talk about other minimum principles in physics.
13730,"There
are many very interesting ones."
13731,"I will not try to list them all now
but will only describe one more."
13732,"Later on, when we come to a physical
phenomenon which has a nice minimum principle, I will tell about it
then."
13733,"I want now to show that we can describe electrostatics, not by
giving a differential equation for the field, but by saying that a
certain integral is a maximum or a minimum."
13734,"“We can show that the two statements about electrostatics are
equivalent."
13735,"Let’s look at what the derivatives
are."
13736,So our ‘minimum’ proposition is correct.
13737,"“We can generalize our proposition if we do our algebra in a little
different way."
13738,"Let’s go back and do our integration by parts without
taking components."
13739,"Now we can use this equation to integrate
by parts."
13740,"“Only now we see how to solve a problem when we don’t know
where all the charges are."
13741,"Suppose that we have conductors with
charges spread out on them in some way."
13742,"We can still use our minimum
principle if the potentials of all the conductors are fixed."
13743,"“There is an interesting case when the only charges are on
conductors."
13744,What is this integral?
13745,"The true field is the one, of all those coming
from the gradient of a potential, with the minimum total energy."
13746,"“I would like to use this result to calculate something particular to
show you that these things are really quite practical."
13747,"Suppose I take
two conductors in the form of a cylindrical condenser
(Fig."
13748,19–12).
13749,"Now we can suppose
any distribution of potential between the two."
13750,“Suppose I don’t know the capacity of a cylindrical condenser.
13751,"I can
use this principle to find it."
13752,"Suppose, for instance, I pick a
potential that corresponds to a constant field."
13753,"A
field which is constant means a potential which goes linearly with
distance."
13754,"Let’s do this calculation for a
cylinder of unit length."
13755,"I have computed out
the answers in Table 19–1."
13756,"The answer
is, of course, a little too high, as expected."
13757,"The thing gets much worse
if you have a tiny wire inside a big cylinder."
13758,"Then the field has
enormous variations and if you represent it by a constant, you’re not
doing very well."
13759,“Now I would like to tell you how to improve such a calculation.
13760,"(Of
course, you know the right answer for the cylinder, but the
method is the same for some other odd shapes, where you may not know
the right answer.)"
13761,"Let us try this
idea out."
13762,"This formula is a little more
complicated."
13763,"It involves a quadratic term in the potential as well as
a linear term."
13764,It is very easy to get the field out of it.
13765,But wait a moment.
13766,"Where the answer
should be good, it is very, very good."
13767,"“I have given these examples, first, to show the theoretical value of
the principles of minimum action and minimum principles in general
and, second, to show their practical utility—not just to calculate a
capacity when we already know the answer."
13768,"You will get excellent numerical
results for otherwise intractable problems.”"
13769,"“I should like to add something that I didn’t have time for in the
lecture."
13770,(I always seem to prepare more than I have time to tell about.)
13771,"As I mentioned earlier, I got interested in a problem while working on
this lecture."
13772,I want to tell you what that problem is.
13773,"Among the minimum
principles that I could mention, I noticed that most of them sprang in
one way or another from the least action principle of mechanics and
electrodynamics."
13774,But there is also a class that does not.
13775,"As an example,
if currents are made to go through a piece of material obeying
Ohm’s law, the currents distribute
themselves inside the piece so that the rate at which heat is generated
is as little as possible."
13776,"Also we can say (if things are kept
isothermal) that the rate at which energy is generated is a minimum."
13777,"Now, this principle also holds, according to classical theory, in
determining even the distribution of velocities of the electrons inside
a metal which is carrying a current."
13778,"The distribution of velocities is
not exactly the equilibrium distribution [Chapter 40,
Vol."
13779,"I, Eq."
13780,(40.6)] because they are drifting sideways.
13781,"The
new distribution can be found from the principle that it is the
distribution for a given current for which the entropy developed per
second by collisions is as small as possible."
13782,"The true description of
the electrons’ behavior ought to be by quantum mechanics, however."
13783,"The
question is: Does the same principle of minimum entropy generation also
hold when the situation is described quantum-mechanically?"
13784,"I haven’t
found out yet."
13785,"“The question is interesting academically, of course."
13786,"Such principles
are fascinating, and it is always worthwhile to try to see how general
they are."
13787,"But also from a more practical point of view, I want to
know."
13788,"I, with some colleagues, have published a paper in which we
calculated by quantum mechanics approximately the electrical resistance
felt by an electron moving through an ionic crystal like NaCl."
13789,"[Feynman, Hellwarth, Iddings,
and Platzman, “Mobility of Slow Electrons in a Polar Crystal,”
Phys."
13790,Rev.
13791,"127, 1004 (1962).]"
13792,"But if a minimum
principle existed, we could use it to make the results much more
accurate, just as the minimum principle for the capacity of a condenser
permitted us to get such accuracy for that capacity even though we had
only a rough knowledge of the electric field.”"
13793,In Chapter 18 we had reached the point where we had the Maxwell equations in complete form.
13794,We considered a special example in which an infinite current sheet is suddenly turned on.
13795,In Fig.
13796,Now consider the following sequence of events.
13797,"We turn on a current of unit strength for a while, then suddenly increase the current strength to three units, and hold it constant at this value."
13798,What do the fields look like then?
13799,We can see what the fields will look like in the following way.
13800,20–2.
13801,20–2.
13802,Now let’s take a more complicated problem.
13803,"Consider a current which is turned on to one unit for a while, then turned up to three units, and later turned off to zero."
13804,What are the fields for such a current?
13805,We can find the solution in the same way—by adding the solutions of three separate problems.
13806,"First, we find the fields for a step current of unit strength."
13807,(We have solved that problem already.)
13808,"Next, we find the fields produced by a step current of two units."
13809,"Finally, we solve for the fields of a step current of minus three units."
13810,A graph of the current as a function of time is shown in Fig.
13811,20–3(a).
13812,20–3(b).
13813,The field is an exact representation of the current.
13814,The field distribution in space is a nice graph of the current variation with time—only drawn backwards.
13815,"If we were to stand miles away, we could tell from the variation of the electric or magnetic field exactly how the current had varied at the source."
13816,"You will also notice that long after all activity at the source has completely stopped and all charges and currents are zero, the block of field continues to travel through space."
13817,We have a distribution of electric and magnetic fields that exist independently of any charges or currents.
13818,That is the new effect that comes from the complete set of Maxwell’s equations.
13819,"We have, believe it or not, already derived this same equation from another point of view in Vol."
13820,"I, when we were dealing with the theory of the index of refraction."
13821,"Then, we had to figure out what fields were produced by a thin layer of oscillating dipoles in a sheet of dielectric material with the dipoles set in motion by the electric field of an incoming electromagnetic wave."
13822,Our problem was to calculate the combined fields of the original wave and the waves radiated by the oscillating dipoles.
13823,How could we have calculated the fields generated by moving charges when we didn’t have Maxwell’s equations?
13824,At that time we took as our starting point (without any derivation) a formula for the radiation fields produced at large distances from an accelerating point charge.
13825,If you will look in Chapter 31 of Vol.
13826,"I, you will see that Eq."
13827,(31.9) there is just the same as the Eq.
13828,(20.3) that we have just written down.
13829,"Although our earlier derivation was correct only at large distances from the source, we see now that the same result continues to be correct even right up to the source."
13830,"We want now to look in a general way at the behavior of electric and magnetic fields in empty space far away from the sources, i.e., from the currents and charges."
13831,"Very near the sources—near enough so that during the delay in transmission, the source has not had time to change much—the fields are very much the same as we have found in what we called the electrostatic or magnetostatic cases."
13832,"If we go out to distances large enough so that the delays become important, however, the nature of the fields can be radically different from the solutions we have found."
13833,"In a sense, the fields begin to take on a character of their own when they have gone a long way from all the sources."
13834,So we can begin by discussing the behavior of the fields in a region where there are no currents or charges.
13835,(20.7).
13836,"All of our electromagnetic fields satisfy the same wave equation, Eq."
13837,(20.8).
13838,We might well ask: What is the most general solution to this equation?
13839,"(Always do an easy case first so that you can see what is going to happen, and then you can go to the more complicated cases.)"
13840,"We are, of course, considering plane waves again."
13841,We should expect to get results something like those in the previous section.
13842,"In fact, we will find precisely the same answers."
13843,"You may ask: “Why do it all over again?” It is important to do it again, first, because we did not show that the waves we found were the most general solutions for plane waves, and second, because we found the fields only from a very particular kind of current source."
13844,We would like to ask now: What is the most general kind of one-dimensional wave there can be in free space?
13845,"We cannot find that by seeing what happens for this or that particular source, but must work with greater generality."
13846,Also we are going to work this time with differential equations instead of with integral forms.
13847,"Although we will get the same results, it is a way of practicing back and forth to show that it doesn’t make any difference which way you go."
13848,"You should know how to do things every which way, because when you get a hard problem, you will often find that only one of the various ways is tractable."
13849,We could consider directly the solution of the wave equation for some electromagnetic quantity.
13850,"Instead, we want to start right from the beginning with Maxwell’s equations in free space so that you can see their close relationship to the electromagnetic waves."
13851,"So we start with the equations in (20.1), setting the charges and currents equal to zero."
13852,Such a field could be the steady dc field from some charged condenser plates a long distance away.
13853,We are not interested now in such an uninteresting static field; we are at the moment interested only in dynamically varying fields.
13854,"We have then the important result that for the propagation of plane waves in any direction, the electric field must be at right angles to the direction of propagation."
13855,So let’s first work out a case in which the electric field has only one transverse component.
13856,The general solution can always be expressed as the superposition of two such fields.
13857,How easy our equations now get.
13858,The rest of Maxwell’s equations then become quite simple.
13859,Let’s look next at the second of Maxwell’s equations [II of Eq.
13860,(20.12)].
13861,Somebody may have left some permanent magnets near where the waves are propagating.
13862,This is exactly what happened in the special wave we have already considered.
13863,We are now ready to use the last of Maxwell’s equations for free space [IV of Eq.
13864,(20.12)].
13865,"The result of all our work is that only one component each of the electric and magnetic fields is not zero, and that these components must satisfy Eqs."
13866,(20.16) and (20.18).
13867,It is the wave equation for one-dimensional waves.
13868,You should note that in the process of our derivation we have found something more than is contained in Eq.
13869,(20.11).
13870,Maxwell’s equations have given us the further information that electromagnetic waves have field components only at right angles to the direction of the wave propagation.
13871,Let’s review what we know about the solutions of the one-dimensional wave equation.
13872,20–4).
13873,Differentiating Eq.
13874,I don’t like this backward method.
13875,"Isn’t there some forward way to find the solution?” Well, one good forward way is to know the solution."
13876,"It is possible to “cook up” an apparently forward mathematical argument, especially because we know what the solution is supposed to be, but with an equation as simple as this we don’t have to play games."
13877,Soon you will get so that when you see Eq.
13878,Actually you should also see a little more.
13879,The general solution is the superposition of two such waves both existing at the same time.
13880,We will leave the following amusing question for you to think about.
13881,Yet you can easily show that this function is a solution of the wave equation by direct substitution into Eq.
13882,(20.20).
13883,How can we then say that the general solution is of the form of Eq.
13884,(20.24)?
13885,"However, the fields which do exist can always be considered as the sum of two patterns."
13886,"Such waves correspond to the electromagnetic waves that we know about—light, radiowaves, infrared radiation, ultraviolet radiation, x-rays, and so on."
13887,We have already discussed the radiation of light in great detail in Vol.
13888,I.
13889,"Since everything we learned there applies to any electromagnetic wave, we don’t need to consider in great detail here the behavior of these waves."
13890,We should perhaps make a few further remarks on the question of the polarization of the electromagnetic waves.
13891,At every point the magnetic field is always perpendicular to the electric field and to the direction of propagation.
13892,We want now to turn to the subject of three-dimensional waves.
13893,It is also easy to arrive at the same conclusion by arguing directly from Maxwell’s equations.
13894,"Also, from the fourth of Maxwell’s equations in free space [Eq."
13895,How shall we find the general wave solution?
13896,The answer is that all the solutions of the three-dimensional wave equation can be represented as a superposition of the one-dimensional solutions we have already found.
13897,"Or in general, since we have written our equations in vector form, the three-dimensional wave equation can have solutions which are plane waves moving in any direction at all."
13898,"Again, since the equations are linear, we may have simultaneously as many plane waves as we wish, travelling in as many different directions."
13899,Thus the most general solution of the three-dimensional wave equation is a superposition of all sorts of plane waves moving in all sorts of directions.
13900,Try to imagine what the electric and magnetic fields look like at present in the space in this lecture room.
13901,"First of all, there is a steady magnetic field; it comes from the currents in the interior of the earth—that is, the earth’s steady magnetic field."
13902,"Then there are some irregular, nearly static electric fields produced perhaps by electric charges generated by friction as various people move about in their chairs and rub their coat sleeves against the chair arms."
13903,But more interesting are the electric and magnetic fields varying at much higher frequencies.
13904,Then there are also infrared waves travelling from the warm foreheads to the cold blackboard.
13905,"And we have forgotten the ultraviolet light, the x-rays, and the radiowaves travelling through the room."
13906,Flying across the room are electromagnetic waves which carry music of a jazz band.
13907,"There are waves modulated by a series of impulses representing pictures of events going on in other parts of the world, or of imaginary aspirins dissolving in imaginary stomachs."
13908,To demonstrate the reality of these waves it is only necessary to turn on electronic equipment that converts these waves into pictures and sounds.
13909,"If we go into further detail to analyze even the smallest wiggles, there are tiny electromagnetic waves that have come into the room from enormous distances."
13910,"There are now tiny oscillations of the electric field, whose crests are separated by a distance of one foot, that have come from millions of miles away, transmitted to the earth from the Mariner II space craft which has just passed Venus."
13911,Its signals carry summaries of information it has picked up about the planets (information obtained from electromagnetic waves that travelled from the planet to the space craft).
13912,There are very tiny wiggles of the electric and magnetic fields that are waves which originated billions of light years away—from galaxies in the remotest corners of the universe.
13913,That this is true has been found by “filling the room with wires”—by building antennas as large as this room.
13914,Such radiowaves have been detected from places in space beyond the range of the greatest optical telescopes.
13915,"Even they, the optical telescopes, are simply gatherers of electromagnetic waves."
13916,"What we call the stars are only inferences, inferences drawn from the only physical reality we have yet gotten from them—from a careful study of the unendingly complex undulations of the electric and magnetic fields reaching us on earth."
13917,"There is, of course, more: the fields produced by lightning miles away, the fields of the charged cosmic ray particles as they zip through the room, and more, and more."
13918,What a complicated thing is the electric field in the space around you!
13919,Yet it always satisfies the three-dimensional wave equation.
13920,I have asked you to imagine these electric and magnetic fields.
13921,What do you do?
13922,Do you know how?
13923,How do I imagine the electric and magnetic field?
13924,What do I actually see?
13925,What are the demands of scientific imagination?
13926,Is it any different from trying to imagine that the room is full of invisible angels?
13927,"No, it is not like imagining invisible angels."
13928,It requires a much higher degree of imagination to understand the electromagnetic field than to understand invisible angels.
13929,Why?
13930,"Because to make invisible angels understandable, all I have to do is to alter their properties a little bit—I make them slightly visible, and then I can see the shapes of their wings, and bodies, and halos."
13931,"Once I succeed in imagining a visible angel, the abstraction required—which is to take almost invisible angels and imagine them completely invisible—is relatively easy."
13932,"So you say, “Professor, please give me an approximate description of the electromagnetic waves, even though it may be slightly inaccurate, so that I too can see them as well as I can see almost invisible angels."
13933,Then I will modify the picture to the necessary abstraction.”
13934,I’m sorry I can’t do that for you.
13935,I don’t know how.
13936,I have no picture of this electromagnetic field that is in any sense accurate.
13937,"I have known about the electromagnetic field a long time—I was in the same position 25 years ago that you are now, and I have had 25 years more of experience thinking about these wiggling waves."
13938,I’ll tell you what I see.
13939,"When I talk about the fields swishing through space, I have a terrible confusion between the symbols I use to describe the objects and the objects themselves."
13940,I cannot really make a picture that is even nearly like the true waves.
13941,"So if you have some difficulty in making such a picture, you should not be worried that your difficulty is unusual."
13942,Our science makes terrific demands on the imagination.
13943,The degree of imagination that is required is much more extreme than that required for some of the ancient ideas.
13944,The modern ideas are much harder to imagine.
13945,"We use a lot of tools, though."
13946,"We use mathematical equations and rules, and make a lot of pictures."
13947,"What I realize now is that when I talk about the electromagnetic field in space, I see some kind of a superposition of all of the diagrams which I’ve ever seen drawn about them."
13948,"I don’t see little bundles of field lines running about because it worries me that if I ran at a different speed the bundles would disappear, I don’t even always see the electric and magnetic fields because sometimes I think I should have made a picture with the vector potential and the scalar potential, for those were perhaps the more physically significant things that were wiggling."
13949,"Perhaps the only hope, you say, is to take a mathematical view."
13950,Now what is a mathematical view?
13951,"From a mathematical view, there is an electric field vector and a magnetic field vector at every point in space; that is, there are six numbers associated with every point."
13952,Can you imagine six numbers associated with each point in space?
13953,That’s too hard.
13954,Can you imagine even one number associated with every point?
13955,I cannot!
13956,I can imagine such a thing as the temperature at every point in space.
13957,That seems to be understandable.
13958,There is a hotness and coldness that varies from place to place.
13959,But I honestly do not understand the idea of a number at every point.
13960,"So perhaps we should put the question: Can we represent the electric field by something more like a temperature, say like the displacement of a piece of jello?"
13961,Suppose that we were to begin by imagining that the world was filled with thin jello and that the fields represented some distortion—say a stretching or twisting—of the jello.
13962,Then we could visualize the field.
13963,After we “see” what it is like we could abstract the jello away.
13964,For many years that’s what people tried to do.
13965,"Maxwell, Ampère, Faraday, and others tried to understand electromagnetism this way."
13966,(Sometimes they called the abstract jello “ether.”) But it turned out that the attempt to imagine the electromagnetic field in that way was really standing in the way of progress.
13967,"We are unfortunately limited to abstractions, to using instruments to detect the field, to using mathematical symbols to describe the field, etc."
13968,"But nevertheless, in some sense the fields are real, because after we are all finished fiddling around with mathematical equations—with or without making pictures and drawings or trying to visualize the thing—we can still make the instruments detect the signals from Mariner II and find out about galaxies a billion miles away, and so on."
13969,The whole question of imagination in science is often misunderstood by people in other disciplines.
13970,They try to test our imagination in the following way.
13971,"They say, “Here is a picture of some people in a situation."
13972,"What do you imagine will happen next?” When we say, “I can’t imagine,” they may think we have a weak imagination."
13973,"They overlook the fact that whatever we are allowed to imagine in science must be consistent with everything else we know: that the electric fields and the waves we talk about are not just some happy thoughts which we are free to make as we wish, but ideas which must be consistent with all the laws of physics we know."
13974,We can’t allow ourselves to seriously imagine things which are obviously in contradiction to the known laws of nature.
13975,And so our kind of imagination is quite a difficult game.
13976,"One has to have the imagination to think of something that has never been seen before, never been heard of before."
13977,"At the same time the thoughts are restricted in a strait jacket, so to speak, limited by the conditions that come from our knowledge of the way nature really is."
13978,"The problem of creating something which is new, but which is consistent with everything which has been seen before, is one of extreme difficulty."
13979,While I’m on this subject I want to talk about whether it will ever be possible to imagine beauty that we can’t see.
13980,It is an interesting question.
13981,"When we look at a rainbow, it looks beautiful to us."
13982,"Everybody says, “Ooh, a rainbow.” (You see how scientific I am."
13983,I am afraid to say something is beautiful unless I have an experimental way of defining it.)
13984,But how would we describe a rainbow if we were blind?
13985,"We are blind when we measure the infrared reflection coefficient of sodium chloride, or when we talk about the frequency of the waves that are coming from some galaxy that we can’t see—we make a diagram, we make a plot."
13986,"For instance, for the rainbow, such a plot would be the intensity of radiation vs. wavelength measured with a spectrophotometer for each direction in the sky."
13987,"Generally, such measurements would give a curve that was rather flat."
13988,"Then some day, someone would discover that for certain conditions of the weather, and at certain angles in the sky, the spectrum of intensity as a function of wavelength would behave strangely; it would have a bump."
13989,"As the angle of the instrument was varied only a little bit, the maximum of the bump would move from one wavelength to another."
13990,Then one day the physical review of the blind men might publish a technical article with the title “The Intensity of Radiation as a Function of Angle under Certain Conditions of the Weather.” In this article there might appear a graph such as the one in Fig.
13991,20–5.
13992,"The author would perhaps remark that at the larger angles there was more radiation at long wavelengths, whereas for the smaller angles the maximum in the radiation came at shorter wavelengths."
13993,Now do we find the graph of Fig.
13994,20–5 beautiful?
13995,"It contains much more detail than we apprehend when we look at a rainbow, because our eyes cannot see the exact details in the shape of a spectrum."
13996,"The eye, however, finds the rainbow beautiful."
13997,Do we have enough imagination to see in the spectral curves the same beauty we see when we look directly at the rainbow?
13998,I don’t know.
13999,"But suppose I have a graph of the reflection coefficient of a sodium chloride crystal as a function of wavelength in the infrared, and also as a function of angle."
14000,"I would have a representation of how it would look to my eyes if they could see in the infrared—perhaps some glowing, shiny “green,” mixed with reflections from the surface in a “metallic red.” That would be a beautiful thing, but I don’t know whether I can ever look at a graph of the reflection coefficient of NaCl measured with some instrument and say that it has the same beauty."
14001,"On the other hand, even if we cannot see beauty in particular measured results, we can already claim to see a certain beauty in the equations which describe general physical laws."
14002,So there is plenty of intellectual beauty associated with the equations.
14003,"We have seen that there are solutions of the wave equation which correspond to plane waves, and that any electromagnetic wave can be described as a superposition of many plane waves."
14004,"In certain special cases, however, it is more convenient to describe the wave field in a different mathematical form."
14005,We would like to discuss now the theory of spherical waves—waves which correspond to spherical surfaces that are spreading out from some center.
14006,"When you drop a stone into a lake, the ripples spread out in circular waves on the surface—they are two-dimensional waves."
14007,A spherical wave is a similar thing except that it spreads out in three dimensions.
14008,"Before we start describing spherical waves, we need a little mathematics."
14009,The Laplacian is the sum of these three derivatives.
14010,"(20.32), you will see that the right-hand side is the same as in Eq."
14011,(20.31).
14012,(20.32).
14013,"We must now solve this equation, which appears to be much more complicated than the plane wave case."
14014,(20.34).
14015,"In other words, unlike a plane wave in which the amplitude remains constant as the wave runs along, in a spherical wave the amplitude steadily decreases, as shown in Fig."
14016,20–6.
14017,This effect is easy to understand from a simple physical argument.
14018,We know that the energy density in a wave depends on the square of the wave amplitude.
14019,"As the wave spreads, its energy is spread over larger and larger areas proportional to the radial distance squared."
14020,So Eq.
14021,(20.35) is the “reasonable” form for a spherical wave.
14022,We are now going to make a special assumption.
14023,"We say, without any demonstration whatever, that the waves generated by a source are only the waves which go outward."
14024,"Since we know that waves are caused by the motion of charges, we want to think that the waves proceed outward from the charges."
14025,"It would be rather strange to imagine that before charges were set in motion, a spherical wave started out from infinity and arrived at the charges just at the time they began to move."
14026,"That is a possible solution, but experience shows that when charges are accelerated the waves travel outward from the charges."
14027,"Although Maxwell’s equations would allow either possibility, we will put in an additional fact—based on experience—that only the outgoing wave solution makes “physical sense.”"
14028,"We should remark, however, that there is an interesting consequence to this additional assumption: we are removing the symmetry with respect to time that exists in Maxwell’s equations."
14029,These equations say that for every solution corresponding to a wave going in one direction there is an equally valid solution for a wave travelling in the opposite direction.
14030,Our statement that we will consider only the outgoing spherical waves is an important additional assumption.
14031,(A formulation of electrodynamics in which this additional assumption is avoided has been carefully studied.
14032,"Surprisingly, in many circumstances it does not lead to physically absurd conclusions, but it would take us too far astray to discuss these ideas just now."
14033,We will talk about them a little more in Chapter 28.)
14034,We must mention another important point.
14035,"In our solution for an outgoing wave, Eq."
14036,That is somewhat peculiar.
14037,We would like to have a wave solution which is smooth everywhere.
14038,Our solution must represent physically a situation in which there is some source at the origin.
14039,"In other words, we have inadvertently made a mistake."
14040,We have not solved the free wave equation (20.33) everywhere; we have solved Eq.
14041,"(20.33) with zero on the right everywhere, except at the origin."
14042,Let’s show that it is easy to make the same kind of mistake in an electrostatic problem.
14043,"The Laplacian is equal to zero, because we are assuming that there are no charges anywhere."
14044,Using the formula of Eq.
14045,Something is evidently wrong.
14046,"In the region where there are no electric charges, we know the solution for the electrostatic potential: the potential is everywhere a constant."
14047,That corresponds to the first term in our solution.
14048,"But we also have the second term, which says that there is a contribution to the potential that varies as one over the distance from the origin."
14049,"We know, however, that such a potential corresponds to a point charge at the origin."
14050,"So, although we thought we were solving for the potential in free space, our solution also gives the field for a point source at the origin."
14051,Do you see the similarity between what happened now and what happened when we solved for a spherically symmetric solution to the wave equation?
14052,"If there were really no charges or currents at the origin, there would not be spherical outgoing waves."
14053,"The spherical waves must, of course, be produced by sources at the origin."
14054,In the next chapter we will investigate the connection between the outgoing electromagnetic waves and the currents and voltages which produce them.
14055,"We saw in the last chapter that among their solutions, Maxwell’s equations have waves of electricity and magnetism."
14056,"These waves correspond to the phenomena of radio, light, x-rays, and so on, depending on the wavelength."
14057,We have already studied light in great detail in Vol.
14058,I.
14059,In this chapter we want to tie together the two subjects—we want to show that Maxwell’s equations can indeed form the base for our earlier treatment of the phenomena of light.
14060,"When we studied light, we began by writing down equations for the electric and magnetic fields produced by a charge which moves in any arbitrary way."
14061,"(28.3) and (28.4), Vol."
14062,I.
14063,"As explained below, the signs here are the negatives of the old ones.]"
14064,21-1).
14065,In Chapters 28 and 34 of Vol.
14066,"Let’s look at what the complete equation, Eq."
14067,"(21.1), says in a little more detail."
14068,But that is only the first term.
14069,"The other terms tell us that the laws of electricity do not say that all the fields are the same as the static ones, but just retarded (which is what people sometimes like to say)."
14070,To the “retarded Coulomb field” we must add the other two terms.
14071,"In a way of speaking, this term tends to compensate for the retardation in the first term."
14072,"Finally, there is a third term in Eq."
14073,"So we concentrated entirely on the last term, and we showed that it is (again, for large distances) proportional to the component of the acceleration of the charge at right angles to the line of sight."
14074,"(Also, for most of our work in Vol."
14075,"I, we took the case in which the charges were moving nonrelativistically."
14076,"We considered the relativistic effects in only one chapter, Chapter 34.)"
14077,Now we should try to connect the two things together.
14078,"We have the Maxwell equations, and we have Eq."
14079,(21.1) for the field of a point charge.
14080,We should certainly ask whether they are equivalent.
14081,If we can deduce Eq.
14082,"(21.1) from Maxwell’s equations, we will really understand the connection between light and electromagnetism."
14083,To make this connection is the main purpose of this chapter.
14084,It turns out that we won’t quite make it—that the mathematical details get too complicated for us to carry through in all their gory details.
14085,But we will come close enough so that you should easily see how the connection could be made.
14086,The missing pieces will only be in the mathematical details.
14087,"Some of you may find the mathematics in this chapter rather complicated, and you may not wish to follow the argument very closely."
14088,"We think it is important, however, to make the connection between what you have learned earlier and what you are learning now, or at least to indicate how such a connection can be made."
14089,"You will notice, if you look over the earlier chapters, that whenever we have taken a statement as a starting point for a discussion, we have carefully explained whether it is a new “assumption” that is a “basic law,” or whether it can ultimately be deduced from some other laws."
14090,We owe it to you in the spirit of these lectures to make the connection between light and Maxwell’s equations.
14091,"If it gets difficult in places, well, that’s life—there is no other way."
14092,Now we will find the solution of Eqs.
14093,(21.4) and (21.5).
14094,"We also remarked that, physically, Eq."
14095,(21.9) does not represent a wave in free space—that there must be charges at the origin to get the outgoing wave started.
14096,"In other words, Eq."
14097,(21.9) is a solution of Eq.
14098,Let’s see how that works.
14099,(21.7) would give rise to a wave like Eq.
14100,(21.9)?
14101,Suppose we have the spherical wave of Eq.
14102,(21.7).
14103,But the time derivatives keep their same values.
14104,(21.7) becomes equivalent to Eq.
14105,(21.11).
14106,We have found the solution of Eq.
14107,(21.7) for a “point” source.
14108,The next question is: What is the solution for a spread-out source?
14109,Since Eq.
14110,"(21.7) is linear, the resultant field is the superposition of the fields from all of such source elements."
14111,Using the results of the preceding section [Eq.
14112,This is the solution of our wave equation for any set of sources.
14113,We see now how to obtain a general solution for Maxwell’s equations.
14114,(21.4) and (21.5).
14115,(21.2) and (21.3).
14116,(21.15) and (21.16) do satisfy the equality (21.6).]
14117,We have solved Maxwell’s equations.
14118,"Given the currents and charges in any circumstance, we can find the potentials directly from these integrals and then differentiate and get the fields."
14119,So we have finished with the Maxwell theory.
14120,"Also this permits us to close the ring back to our theory of light, because to connect with our earlier work on light, we need only calculate the electric field from a moving charge."
14121,We should get Eq.
14122,(21.1).
14123,"It turns out to be lots of work, but that’s the principle."
14124,"So here is the center of the universe of electromagnetism—the complete theory of electricity and magnetism, and of light; a complete description of the fields produced by any moving charges; and more."
14125,It is all here.
14126,"Here is the structure built by Maxwell, complete in all its power and beauty."
14127,It is probably one of the greatest accomplishments of physics.
14128,"To remind you of its importance, we will put it all together in a nice frame."
14129,We have still not lived up to our promise to derive Eq.
14130,(21.1) for the electric field of a point charge in motion.
14131,"Even with the results we already have, it is a relatively complicated thing to derive."
14132,We have not found Eq.
14133,(21.1) anywhere in the published literature except in Vol.
14134,I of these lectures.1 So you can see that it is not easy to derive.
14135,"(The fields of a moving charge have been written in many other forms that are equivalent, of course.)"
14136,"We will have to limit ourselves here just to showing that, in a few examples, Eqs."
14137,(21.15) and (21.16) give the same results as Eq.
14138,(21.1).
14139,"First, we will show that Eq."
14140,(21.1) gives the correct fields with only the restriction that the motion of the charged particle is nonrelativistic.
14141,"We consider a situation in which we have a blob of charge that is moving about in some way, in a small region, and we will find the fields far away."
14142,"To put it another way, we are finding the field at any distance from a point charge that is shaking up and down in very small motion."
14143,Let’s see if we get such a result.
14144,(21.16).
14145,21-2.
14146,So we are making a nonrelativistic calculation.
14147,The second term in Eq.
14148,(21.20) gives us the new effects.
14149,"This term, which comes from differentiating the numerator, is responsible for radiation."
14150,"Second, it depends on the acceleration of the charge."
14151,You can begin to see how we are going to get a result like Eq.
14152,"(21.1´), which describes the radiation of light."
14153,Let’s examine in a little more detail how this radiation term comes about—it is such an interesting and important result.
14154,We can see why in the following way: Suppose that we let our dipole oscillate up and down in a sinusoidal motion.
14155,21-3.
14156,"When we take the spatial derivatives, they will be proportional to the slope of the curve."
14157,So that explains the drop-off rate of the radiation term.
14158,"It all comes about because the variations with time at the source are translated into variations in space as the waves are propagated outward, and the magnetic fields depend on the spatial derivatives of the potential."
14159,Let’s go back and finish our calculation of the magnetic field.
14160,Now let’s look at this formula.
14161,21-4.
14162,Everything is coming out right; that is also the result we get from Eq.
14163,(21.1´).
14164,Now let’s look at what we are not used to—at what happens closer in.
14165,In Section 14-7 we worked out the law of Biot and Savart for the magnetic field of an element of current.
14166,But there is one difference.
14167,In Eq.
14168,(21.24).
14169,"Actually, however, Eq."
14170,(21.23) tends to cancel out the effect of the retardation in the first term.
14171,The two together give a result very near to Eq.
14172,(21.23) in a Taylor series.
14173,So Eq.
14174,(21.23) gives fields very much like the instantaneous theory—much closer than the instantaneous theory with a delay; the first-order effects of the delay are taken out by the second term.
14175,"The static formulas are very accurate, much more accurate than you might think."
14176,"Of course, the compensation only works for points close in."
14177,We still have the problem of computing the electric field and demonstrating that it is the same as Eq.
14178,(21.1´).
14179,For large distances we can see that the answer is going to come out all right.
14180,(21.1´).
14181,"To get the electric field completely for all distances, we need to solve for the electrostatic potential."
14182,This approximation is too rough.
14183,We need to go to one higher order.
14184,"Instead of getting involved in that higher-order computation directly, we can do something else—we can determine the scalar potential from Eq."
14185,"(21.6), using the vector potential we have already found."
14186,"For the oscillating dipole we have taken, there is no static field.)"
14187,"Although it looks rather complicated, the result is easily interpreted."
14188,"[See Chapter 6, Eq."
14189,(6.14).]
14190,This result agrees with what we would have gotten using Eq.
14191,(21.1).
14192,"Of course, Eq."
14193,"(21.1) is more general; it works with any motion, while Eq."
14194,"At any rate, we have now provided the underpinnings for our entire previous discussion of light (excepting some matters discussed in Chapter 34 of Vol."
14195,"I), for it all hinged on the last term of Eq."
14196,(21.26).
14197,We will discuss next how the fields can be obtained for more rapidly moving charges (leading to the relativistic effects of Chapter 34 of Vol.
14198,I).
14199,But in doing so we missed an important point and also one where it is easy to go wrong.
14200,We will therefore take up now a calculation of the potentials for a point charge moving in any way whatever—even with a relativistic velocity.
14201,"Once we have this result, we will have the complete electromagnetism of electric charges."
14202,Even Eq.
14203,(21.1) can then be derived by taking derivatives.
14204,The story will be complete.
14205,So bear with us.
14206,It is wrong.
14207,We will now show you why.
14208,21-5(a).
14209,Now to evaluate the integral of Eq.
14210,21-5(b).
14211,The individual elements will appear as shown in Fig.
14212,"21-6(a), where we have put in more than enough to cover the charge."
14213,"But we have not shown the charge, and for a good reason."
14214,Where should we draw it?
14215,Let’s say that we begin with the volume element labeled “1” in Fig.
14216,21-6(b).
14217,21-6(c).
14218,Now we can evaluate the sum.
14219,21-6(e).
14220,(21.29).
14221,"Also, the analysis we have made goes exactly the same way for a charge distribution of any shape—it doesn’t have to be a cube."
14222,(21.16).
14223,The potentials for a point charge were first deduced in this form by Liénard and Wiechert and are called the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.
14224,To close the ring back to Eq.
14225,It is now only arithmetic.
14226,"The arithmetic, however, is fairly involved, so we will not write out the details."
14227,Perhaps you will take our word for it that Eq.
14228,(21.1) is equivalent to the Liénard-Wiechert potentials we have derived.2
14229,We want next to use the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a special case—to find the fields of a charge moving with uniform velocity in a straight line.
14230,"We will do it again later, using the principle of relativity."
14231,We already know what the potentials are when we are standing in the rest frame of a charge.
14232,"When the charge is moving, we can figure everything out by a relativistic transformation from one system to the other."
14233,But relativity had its origin in the theory of electricity and magnetism.
14234,"The formulas of the Lorentz transformation (Chapter 15, Vol."
14235,I) were discoveries made by Lorentz when he was studying the equations of electricity and magnetism.
14236,"So that you can appreciate where things have come from, we would like to show that the Maxwell equations do lead to the Lorentz transformation."
14237,"We begin by calculating the potentials of a charge moving with uniform velocity, directly from the electrodynamics of Maxwell’s equations."
14238,We have shown that Maxwell’s equations lead to the potentials for a moving charge that we got in the last section.
14239,"So when we use these potentials, we are using Maxwell’s theory."
14240,21-7.
14241,(21.35).
14242,(21.36).
14243,In Eq.
14244,(21.39) you can clearly see the beginning of the Lorentz transformation.
14245,(21.39)?
14246,"In fact, it is almost apparent from Eqs."
14247,Later we will take up in more detail the relativity of electrodynamics; here we only wished to show how naturally the Maxwell equations lead to the Lorentz transformation.
14248,"You will not, then, be surprised to find that the laws of electricity and magnetism are already correct for Einstein’s relativity."
14249,"We will not have to “fix them up,” as we had to do for Newton’s laws of mechanics."
14250,Most of our work in this course has been aimed at reaching the complete equations of Maxwell.
14251,In the last two chapters we have been discussing the consequences of these equations.
14252,"We have found that the equations contain all the static phenomena we had worked out earlier, as well as the phenomena of electromagnetic waves and light that we had gone over in some detail in Volume I."
14253,"The Maxwell equations give both phenomena, depending upon whether one computes the fields close to the currents and charges, or very far from them."
14254,There is not much interesting to say about the intermediate region; no special phenomena appear there.
14255,"There still remain, however, several subjects in electromagnetism that we want to take up."
14256,We want to discuss the question of relativity and the Maxwell equations—what happens when one looks at the Maxwell equations with respect to moving coordinate systems.
14257,There is also the question of the conservation of energy in electromagnetic systems.
14258,"Then there is the broad subject of the electromagnetic properties of materials; so far, except for the study of the properties of dielectrics, we have considered only the electromagnetic fields in free space."
14259,"And although we covered the subject of light in some detail in Volume I, there are still a few things we would like to do again from the point of view of the field equations."
14260,"In particular, we want to take up again the subject of the index of refraction, particularly for dense materials."
14261,"Finally, there are the phenomena associated with waves confined in a limited region of space."
14262,We touched on this kind of problem briefly when we were studying sound waves.
14263,Maxwell’s equations lead also to solutions which represent confined waves of the electric and magnetic fields.
14264,"We will take up this subject, which has important technical applications, in some of the following chapters."
14265,"In order to lead up to that subject, we will begin by considering the properties of electrical circuits at low frequencies."
14266,We will then be able to make a comparison between those situations in which the almost static approximations of Maxwell’s equations are applicable and those situations in which high-frequency effects are dominant.
14267,So we descend from the great and esoteric heights of the last few chapters and turn to the relatively low-level subject of electrical circuits.
14268,"We will see, however, that even such a mundane subject, when looked at in sufficient detail, can contain great complications."
14269,We have already discussed some of the properties of electrical circuits in Chapters 23 and 25 of Vol.
14270,I.
14271,"Now we will cover some of the same material again, but in greater detail."
14272,"Again we are going to deal only with linear systems and with voltages and currents which all vary sinusoidally; we can then represent all voltages and currents by complex numbers, using the exponential notation described in Chapter 23 of Vol."
14273,I.
14274,"In our earlier discussion of circuits we assumed that such things as inductances, capacitances, and resistances were familiar to you."
14275,We want now to look in a little more detail at what is meant by these idealized circuit elements.
14276,We begin with the inductance.
14277,"An inductance is made by winding many turns of wire in the form of a coil and bringing the two ends out to terminals at some distance from the coil, as shown in Fig."
14278,22–1.
14279,We want to assume that the magnetic field produced by currents in the coil does not spread out strongly all over space and interact with other parts of the circuit.
14280,"This is usually arranged by winding the coil in a doughnut-shaped form, or by confining the magnetic field by winding the coil on a suitable iron core, or by placing the coil in some suitable metal box, as indicated schematically in Fig."
14281,22–1.
14282,We are also going to assume that we can neglect any electrical resistance in the wire of the coil.
14283,"Finally, we will assume that we can neglect the amount of electrical charge that appears on the surface of a wire in building up the electric fields."
14284,With all these approximations we have what we call an “ideal” inductance.
14285,(We will come back later and discuss what happens in a real inductance.)
14286,Let’s see why that is so.
14287,"When there is a current through the inductance, a magnetic field proportional to the current is built up inside the coil."
14288,"If the current changes with time, the magnetic field also changes."
14289,(The smallest fields would produce infinite currents.)
14290,"Since we have assumed that there are no magnetic fields in the space outside of the “box,” this part of the integral is independent of the path chosen and we can define the potentials of the two terminals."
14291,The way we have described the ideal inductance illustrates the general approach to other ideal circuit elements—usually called “lumped” elements.
14292,The properties of the element are described completely in terms of currents and voltages that appear at the terminals.
14293,"By making suitable approximations, it is possible to ignore the great complexities of the fields that appear inside the object."
14294,A separation is made between what happens inside and what happens outside.
14295,For all the circuit elements we will find a relation like the one in Eq.
14296,"(22.4), in which the voltage is proportional to the current with a proportionality constant that is, in general, a complex number."
14297,Now let’s look at a capacitor from the same point of view.1 A capacitor consists of a pair of conducting plates from which two wires are brought out to suitable terminals.
14298,"The plates may be of any shape whatsoever, and are often separated by some dielectric material."
14299,We illustrate such a situation schematically in Fig.
14300,22–2.
14301,Again we make several simplifying assumptions.
14302,We assume that the plates and the wires are perfect conductors.
14303,"We also assume that the insulation between the plates is perfect, so that no charges can flow across the insulation from one plate to the other."
14304,"Next, we assume that the two conductors are close to each other but far from all others, so that all field lines which leave one plate end up on the other."
14305,Then there are always equal and opposite charges on the two plates and the charges on the plates are much larger than the charges on the surfaces of the lead-in wires.
14306,"Finally, we assume that there are no magnetic fields close to the capacitor."
14307,From Eq.
14308,The third element we want to consider is a resistor.
14309,"However, since we have not yet discussed the electrical properties of real materials, we are not yet ready to talk about what happens inside a real conductor."
14310,"We will just have to accept as fact that electric fields can exist inside real materials, that these electric fields give rise to a flow of electric charge—that is, to a current—and that this current is proportional to the integral of the electric field from one end of the conductor to the other."
14311,We then imagine an ideal resistor constructed as in the diagram of Fig.
14312,22–3.
14313,We will see later that the relation between the current and the voltage for real conducting materials is only approximately linear.
14314,We will also see that this approximate proportionality is expected to be independent of the frequency of variation of the current and voltage only if the frequency is not too high.
14315,"Our results for the three lumped circuit elements—the inductor, the capacitor, and the resistor—are summarized in Fig."
14316,22–4.
14317,"In this figure, as well as in the preceding ones, we have indicated the voltage by an arrow that is directed from one terminal to another."
14318,"For zero frequency—that is, for dc—the impedance of an inductance goes to zero; it becomes a short circuit."
14319,"For dc, the impedance of a condenser goes to infinity; it becomes an open circuit."
14320,"Since the impedance of a resistor is independent of frequency, it is the only element left when we analyze a circuit for dc."
14321,"In the circuit elements we have described so far, the current and voltage are proportional to each other."
14322,"If one is zero, so also is the other."
14323,"We usually think in terms like these: An applied voltage is “responsible” for the current, or a current “gives rise to” a voltage across the terminals; so in a sense the elements “respond” to the “applied” external conditions."
14324,For this reason these elements are called passive elements.
14325,"They can thus be contrasted with the active elements, such as the generators we will consider in the next section, which are the sources of the oscillating currents or voltages in a circuit."
14326,"Now we want to talk about an active circuit element—one that is a source of the currents and voltages in a circuit—namely, a generator."
14327,"Suppose that we have a coil like an inductance except that it has very few turns, so that we may neglect the magnetic field of its own current."
14328,"This coil, however, sits in a changing magnetic field such as might be produced by a rotating magnet, as sketched in Fig."
14329,22–5.
14330,(We have seen earlier that such a rotating magnetic field can also be produced by a suitable set of coils with alternating currents.)
14331,Again we must make several simplifying assumptions.
14332,The assumptions we will make are all the ones that we described for the case of the inductance.
14333,"In particular, we assume that the varying magnetic field is restricted to a definite region in the vicinity of the coil and does not appear outside the generator in the space between the terminals."
14334,Thus a generator—at least the ideal generator we are considering—is not an impedance.
14335,Such an ideal generator is represented by the symbol shown in Fig.
14336,22–6.
14337,The little arrow represents the direction of the emf when it is positive.
14338,A positive emf in the generator of Fig.
14339,There is another way to make a generator which is quite different on the inside but which is indistinguishable from the one we have just described insofar as what happens beyond its terminals.
14340,"Suppose we have a coil of wire which is rotated in a fixed magnetic field, as indicated in Fig."
14341,22–7.
14342,"We show a bar magnet to indicate the presence of a magnetic field; it could, of course, be replaced by any other source of a steady magnetic field, such as an additional coil carrying a steady current."
14343,Now in the system of Fig.
14344,"22–7 there are no changing magnetic fields, so we might at first wonder how any voltage could appear at the generator terminals."
14345,"In fact, there are no electric fields anywhere inside the generator."
14346,"We are, as usual, assuming for our ideal elements that the wires inside are made of a perfectly conducting material, and as we have said many times, the electric field inside a perfect conductor is equal to zero."
14347,But that is not true.
14348,It is not true when a conductor is moving in a magnetic field.
14349,The true statement is that the total force on any charge inside a perfect conductor must be zero.
14350,Otherwise there would be an infinite flow of the free charges.
14351,(22.12).
14352,Returning to our generator of Fig.
14353,So the first integral in Eq.
14354,It turns out that the right-hand integral of Eq.
14355,(22.13) is just the rate of change of the flux linkage through the coil and is therefore—by the flux rule—equal to the emf in the coil.
14356,"So we have again that the potential difference across the terminals is equal to the electromotive force in the circuit, in agreement with Eq."
14357,(22.11).
14358,"So whether we have a generator in which a magnetic field changes near a fixed coil, or one in which a coil moves in a fixed magnetic field, the external properties of the generators are the same."
14359,"So long as we are trying to understand the operation of generators from the point of view of Maxwell’s equations, we might also ask about the ordinary chemical cell, like a flashlight battery."
14360,"It is also a generator, i.e., a voltage source, although it will of course only appear in dc circuits."
14361,The simplest kind of cell to understand is shown in Fig.
14362,22–8.
14363,We imagine two metal plates immersed in some chemical solution.
14364,We suppose that the solution contains positive and negative ions.
14365,"We suppose also that one kind of ion, say the negative, is much heavier than the one of opposite polarity, so that its motion through the solution by the process of diffusion is much slower."
14366,"We suppose next that by some means or other it is arranged that the concentration of the solution is made to vary from one part of the liquid to the other, so that the number of ions of both polarities near, say, the lower plate is much larger than the concentration of ions near the upper plate."
14367,"Because of their rapid mobility the positive ions will drift more readily into the region of lower concentration, so that there will be a slight excess of positive charge arriving at the upper plate."
14368,The upper plate will become positively charged and the lower plate will have a net negative charge.
14369,"As more and more charges diffuse to the upper plate, the potential of this plate will rise until the resulting electric field between the plates produces forces on the ions which just compensate for their excess mobility, so the two plates of the cell quickly reach a potential difference which is characteristic of the internal construction."
14370,"There is, of course, an essential difference between a capacitor and such a chemical cell."
14371,"If we short-circuit the terminals of a condenser for a moment, the capacitor is discharged and there is no longer any potential difference across the terminals."
14372,"In the case of the chemical cell a current can be drawn from the terminals continuously without any change in the emf—until, of course, the chemicals inside the cell have been used up."
14373,In a real cell it is found that the potential difference across the terminals decreases as the current drawn from the cell increases.
14374,"In keeping with the abstractions we have been making, however, we may imagine an ideal cell in which the voltage across the terminals is independent of the current."
14375,A real cell can then be looked at as an ideal cell in series with a resistor.
14376,"As we have seen in the last section, the description of an ideal circuit element in terms of what happens outside the element is quite simple."
14377,The current and the voltage are linearly related.
14378,"But what is actually happening inside the element is quite complicated, and it is quite difficult to give a precise description in terms of Maxwell’s equations."
14379,"Imagine trying to give a precise description of the electric and magnetic fields of the inside of a radio which contains hundreds of resistors, capacitors, and inductors."
14380,It would be an impossible task to analyze such a thing by using Maxwell’s equations.
14381,"But by making the many approximations we have described in Section 22–2 and summarizing the essential features of the real circuit elements in terms of idealizations, it becomes possible to analyze an electrical circuit in a relatively straightforward way."
14382,We will now show how that is done.
14383,"Suppose we have a circuit consisting of a generator and several impedances connected together, as shown in Fig."
14384,22–9.
14385,According to our approximations there is no magnetic field in the region outside the individual circuit elements.
14386,22–9.
14387,Each piece is the line integral from one terminal of a circuit element to the other.
14388,This line integral we have called the voltage drop across the circuit element.
14389,Suppose we consider now a circuit like that shown in Fig.
14390,22–10.
14391,Now one of our idealizations has been that negligible electrical charges accumulate on the terminals of the impedances.
14392,We now assume further that any electrical charges on the wires joining terminals can also be neglected.
14393,Then the conservation of charge requires that any charge which leaves one circuit element immediately enters some other circuit element.
14394,"Or, what is the same thing, we require that the algebraic sum of the currents which enter any given junction must be zero."
14395,Such a set of connected terminals is usually called a “node.” The conservation of charge then requires that for the circuit of Fig.
14396,(22.15).
14397,The two equations are not independent.
14398,Our earlier conclusion that the sum of the voltage drops around a closed loop is zero must apply to any loop in a complicated circuit.
14399,"Also, our result that the sum of the currents into a node is zero must be true for any node."
14400,These two equations are known as Kirchhoff’s rules.
14401,With these two rules it is possible to solve for the currents and voltages in any network whatever.
14402,Suppose we consider the more complicated circuit of Fig.
14403,22–11.
14404,How shall we find the currents and voltages in this circuit?
14405,We can find them in the following straightforward way.
14406,"We consider separately each of the four subsidiary closed loops, which appear in the circuit."
14407,For each of the loops we write the equation for the first of Kirchhoff’s rules—that the sum of the voltages around each loop is equal to zero.
14408,We must remember to count the voltage drop as positive if we are going in the direction of the current and negative if we are going across an element in the direction opposite to the current; and we must remember that the voltage drop across a generator is the negative of the emf in that direction.
14409,"Next, we must write the current equation for each of the nodes in the circuit."
14410,"It turns out, however, that any one of these equations can be derived from the other four; there are, therefore, only four independent current equations."
14411,"We thus have a total of eight independent, linear equations: the four voltage equations and the four current equations."
14412,With these eight equations we can solve for the eight unknown currents.
14413,Once the currents are known the circuit is solved.
14414,"The voltage drop across any element is given by the current through that element times its impedance (or, in the case of the voltage sources, it is already known)."
14415,"We have seen that when we write the current equations, we get one equation which is not independent of the others."
14416,Generally it is also possible to write down too many voltage equations.
14417,"For example, in the circuit of Fig."
14418,"22–11, although we have considered only the four small loops, there are a large number of other loops for which we could write the voltage equation."
14419,You can see that there are many loops.
14420,In analyzing complicated circuits it is very easy to get too many equations.
14421,"There are rules which tell us how to proceed so that only the minimum number of equations is written down, but usually with a little thought it is possible to see how to get the right number of equations in the simplest form."
14422,"Besides, writing an extra equation or two doesn’t do any harm."
14423,"They will not lead to any wrong answers, only perhaps a little unnecessary algebra."
14424,In Chapter 25 of Vol.
14425,It is often possible to analyze a complicated circuit by repeated application of the formulas for series and parallel impedances.
14426,"For instance, the circuit of Fig."
14427,22–12 can be analyzed that way.
14428,Then by working backward one can solve for the currents in each of the impedances.
14429,"There are, however, quite simple circuits which cannot be analyzed by this method, as for example the circuit of Fig."
14430,22–13.
14431,To analyze this circuit we must write down the current and voltage equations from Kirchhoff’s rules.
14432,Let’s do it.
14433,Another example of a circuit that cannot be analyzed by using the rules for series and parallel impedance is shown in Fig.
14434,22–14.
14435,Such a circuit is called a “bridge.” It appears in many instruments used for measuring impedances.
14436,We leave it for you to find the conditions for which this is so.
14437,22–15(a).
14438,But this equation is just what we would write for the circuit of Fig.
14439,22–15(b).
14440,22–15 are equivalent.
14441,"This statement is of course, just a remark about what comes out of Kirchhoff’s rules—and ultimately from the linearity of Maxwell’s equations."
14442,The idea can be generalized to a circuit that contains generators as well as impedances.
14443,22–16(a).
14444,"For instance, for the circuit of Fig."
14445,This can be written (by rearranging Eq.
14446,"22–15(b), the equation corresponding to Eq."
14447,22–16 can always be replaced by an equivalent combination of a generator in series with an impedance.
14448,"When the current falls back to zero, this energy is delivered back to the external circuit."
14449,There is no energy-loss mechanism in an ideal inductance.
14450,"When there is an alternating current through an inductance, energy flows back and forth between it and the rest of the circuit, but the average rate at which energy is delivered to the circuit is zero."
14451,"We say that an inductance is a nondissipative element; no electrical energy is dissipated—that is, “lost”—in it."
14452,"When a condenser is in an ac circuit energy flows in and out of it, but the net energy flow in each cycle is zero."
14453,An ideal condenser is also a nondissipative element.
14454,We know that an emf is a source of energy.
14455,This energy goes into heat in the resistor and is lost from the electrical energy of the circuit.
14456,We say that electrical energy is dissipated in a resistor.
14457,"(By “loss” we mean, of course, conversion of electrical energy into thermal energy.)"
14458,From the point of view of equivalent circuits we can say that any impedance is equivalent to a resistance in series with a pure imaginary impedance—called a reactance—as shown in Fig.
14459,22–17.
14460,We can see that this must be true in general for a reactance.
14461,Now we must be careful.
14462,"(The real parts of the complex functions will represent the actual physical quantities only when we have linear equations; now we are concerned with products, which are certainly not linear.)"
14463,The two terms in Eq.
14464,22–17.
14465,"We see that the voltage drop across the resistance is in phase with the current, while the voltage drop across the purely reactive part is out of phase with the current."
14466,There is no energy loss in the reactive part.
14467,We would like now to consider an interesting circuit which can be analyzed in terms of series and parallel combinations.
14468,Suppose we start with the circuit of Fig.
14469,22–18(a).
14470,"Now let’s take a little harder circuit, the one shown in Fig."
14471,22–18(b).
14472,"We could analyze this circuit using Kirchhoff’s rules, but it is also easy to handle with series and parallel combinations."
14473,Now we may ask an amusing question: What would happen if in the network of Fig.
14474,22–18(b) we kept on adding more sections forever—as we indicate by the dashed lines in Fig.
14475,22–19(a)?
14476,Can we solve such an infinite network?
14477,"Well, that’s not so hard."
14478,"First, we notice that such an infinite network is unchanged if we add one more section at the “front” end."
14479,"Surely, if we add one more section to an infinite network it is still the same infinite network."
14480,"Therefore, so far as the front end is concerned, we can represent the network as shown in Fig."
14481,22–19(b).
14482,22–20(a).
14483,(22.27) is just one-half the impedance of the first element.
14484,"It would therefore seem more natural, or at least somewhat simpler, if we were to draw our infinite network as shown in Fig."
14485,22–20(b).
14486,"We have said earlier that a circuit which contains only imaginary impedances, such as inductances and capacitances, will have an impedance which is purely imaginary."
14487,"For higher frequencies the impedance is purely imaginary, in agreement with our earlier statement."
14488,For lower frequencies the impedance is a pure resistance and will therefore absorb energy.
14489,"But how can the circuit continuously absorb energy, as a resistance does, if it is made only of inductances and capacitances?"
14490,"Answer: Because there is an infinite number of inductances and capacitances, so that when a source is connected to the circuit, it supplies energy to the first inductance and capacitance, then to the second, to the third, and so on."
14491,"In a circuit of this kind, energy is continually absorbed from the generator at a constant rate and flows constantly out into the network, supplying energy which is stored in the inductances and capacitances down the line."
14492,This idea suggests an interesting point about what is happening in the circuit.
14493,"We would expect that if we connect a source to the front end, the effects of this source will be propagated through the network toward the infinite end."
14494,We saw in the last section that the infinite ladder network of Fig.
14495,We suggested that this effect could be understood in terms of a continuous transport of energy down the line.
14496,Let’s see whether these ideas are right.
14497,22–21(a).
14498,22–21(b).
14499,22–20(a).
14500,22–22.
14501,We say that the network “passes” low frequencies and “rejects” or “filters out” the high frequencies.
14502,Any network designed to have its characteristics vary in a prescribed way with frequency is called a “filter.” We have been analyzing a “low-pass filter.”
14503,You may be wondering why all this discussion of an infinite network which obviously cannot actually occur.
14504,But it is often possible to do so with a fair approximation for a certain range of frequencies.
14505,In this way one can make a finite filter network whose properties are very nearly the same as those for the infinite case.
14506,"22–23(a), we can have a filter that propagates high frequencies and rejects low frequencies."
14507,It is easy to see what happens with this network by using the results we already have.
14508,22–23(b).
14509,The low-pass and high-pass filters we have described have various technical applications.
14510,"If we want to manufacture dc power from an ac source, we begin with a rectifier which permits current to flow only in one direction."
14511,"22–24, which is lousy dc, because it wobbles up and down."
14512,"Suppose we would like a nice pure dc, such as a battery provides."
14513,We can come close to that by putting a low-pass filter between the rectifier and the load.
14514,We know from Chapter 50 of Vol.
14515,I that the time function in Fig.
14516,"22–24 can be represented as a superposition of a constant voltage plus a sine wave, plus a higher-frequency sine wave, plus a still higher-frequency sine wave, etc.—by a Fourier series."
14517,And amplitudes of the higher harmonics will be cut down even more.
14518,"So we can get the output as smooth as we wish, depending only on how many filter sections we are willing to buy."
14519,A high-pass filter is used if one wants to reject certain low frequencies.
14520,"For instance, in a phonograph amplifier a high-pass filter may be used to let the music through, while keeping out the low-pitched rumbling from the motor of the turntable."
14521,Such a band-pass filter might have a propagation constant like that shown in Fig.
14522,22–25(a).
14523,"It might be used, for example, in separating signals that occupy only an interval of frequencies, such as each of the many voice channels in a high-frequency telephone cable, or the modulated carrier of a radio transmission."
14524,We have seen in Chapter 25 of Vol.
14525,"I that such filtering can also be done using the selectivity of an ordinary resonance curve, which we have drawn for comparison in Fig."
14526,22–25(b).
14527,But the resonant filter is not as good for some purposes as the band-pass filter.
14528,"You will remember (Chapter 48, Vol."
14529,"With a resonant filter, these side-bands are always attenuated somewhat, and the attenuation is more, the higher the signal frequency, as you can see from the figure."
14530,So there is a poor “frequency response.” The higher musical tones don’t get through.
14531,22–20 is also an approximate representation of a transmission line.
14532,"If we have a long conductor that runs parallel to another conductor—such as a wire in a coaxial cable, or a wire suspended above the earth—there will be some capacitance between the two conductors and also some inductance due to the magnetic field between them."
14533,We can then use our results for the ladder filter.
14534,So if we take the limit of Eq.
14535,There is no cutoff frequency for an ideal transmission line.
14536,"We have so far defined only the ideal circuit impedances—the inductance, the capacitance, and the resistance—as well as the ideal voltage generator."
14537,"We want now to show that other elements, such as mutual inductances or transistors or vacuum tubes, can be described by using only the same basic elements."
14538,"Suppose that we have two coils and that on purpose, or otherwise, some flux from one of the coils links the other, as shown in Fig."
14539,22–26(a).
14540,Can we take into account such an effect in our equivalent circuits?
14541,We can in the following way.
14542,"The sign of the second term can be plus or minus, depending on the way the flux from one coil links the other."
14543,"Making the same approximations we used in describing an ideal inductance, we would say that the potential difference across the terminals of each coil is equal to the electromotive force in the coil."
14544,Then the two equations of (22.34) are the same as the ones we would get from the circuit of Fig.
14545,"We must in addition, of course, have the equation that relates this emf to the current in some other part of the circuit; but so long as this equation is linear, we have just added more linear equations to our circuit equations, and all of our earlier conclusions about equivalent circuits and so forth are still correct."
14546,In addition to mutual inductances there may also be mutual capacitances.
14547,"So far, when we have talked about condensers we have always imagined that there were only two electrodes, but in many situations, for example in a vacuum tube, there may be many electrodes close to each other."
14548,"If we put an electric charge on any one of the electrodes, its electric field will induce charges on each of the other electrodes and affect its potential."
14549,"As an example, consider the arrangement of four plates shown in Fig."
14550,22–27(a).
14551,"So long as we are only worried about electrostatic effects, the equivalent circuit of such an arrangement of electrodes is as shown in part (b) of the figure."
14552,The electrostatic interaction of any electrode with each of the others is equivalent to a capacity between the two electrodes.
14553,"Finally, let’s consider how we should represent such complicated devices as transistors and radio tubes in an ac circuit."
14554,We should point out at the start that such devices are often operated in such a way that the relationship between the currents and voltages is not at all linear.
14555,"In such cases, those statements we have made which depend on the linearity of equations are, of course, no longer correct."
14556,"On the other hand, in many applications the operating characteristics are sufficiently linear that we may consider the transistors and tubes to be linear devices."
14557,"By this we mean that the alternating currents in, say, the plate of a vacuum tube are linearly proportional to the voltages that appear on the other electrodes, say the grid voltage and the plate voltage."
14558,"When we have such linear relationships, we can incorporate the device into our equivalent circuit representation."
14559,"As in the case of the mutual inductance, our representation will have to include auxiliary voltage generators which describe the influence of the voltages or currents in one part of the device on the currents or voltages in another part."
14560,"For example, the plate circuit of a triode can usually be represented by a resistance in series with an ideal voltage generator whose source strength is proportional to the grid voltage."
14561,We get the equivalent circuit shown in Fig.
14562,"22–28.2 Similarly, the collector circuit of a transistor is conveniently represented as a resistor in series with an ideal voltage generator whose source strength is proportional to the current from the emitter to the base of the transistor."
14563,The equivalent circuit is then like that in Fig.
14564,22–29.
14565,"So long as the equations which describe the operation are linear, we can use such representations for tubes or transistors."
14566,"Then, when they are incorporated in a complicated network, our general conclusions about the equivalent representation of any arbitrary connection of elements is still valid."
14567,But it is the important characteristic of transistors and tubes that they supply energy to the circuit.
14568,(Of course they don’t just “make” energy; they take energy from the dc circuits of the power supplies and convert it into ac energy.)
14569,So it is possible to have a circuit with a negative resistance.
14570,"Such a circuit has the property that if you connect it to an impedance with a positive real part, i.e., a positive resistance, and arrange matters so that the sum of the two real parts is exactly zero, then there is no dissipation in the combined circuit."
14571,"If there is no loss of energy, any alternating voltage once started will remain forever."
14572,This is the basic idea behind the operation of an oscillator or signal generator which can be used as a source of alternating voltage at any desired frequency.
14573,"We don’t want to consider the general problem now, but only look at what might be expected from physical arguments for a few cases."
14574,"If we think of a real resistor, we know that the current through it will produce a magnetic field."
14575,So any real resistor should also have some inductance.
14576,"Also, when a resistor has a potential difference across it, there must be charges on the ends of the resistor to produce the necessary electric fields."
14577,"As the voltage changes, the charges will change in proportion, so the resistor will also have some capacitance."
14578,We expect that a real resistor might have the equivalent circuit shown in Fig.
14579,23–1.
14580,It may therefore be possible to neglect them.
14581,"As the frequency is raised, however, they will eventually become important, and a resistor begins to look like a resonant circuit."
14582,"A real coil of wire will have some resistance, so at low frequencies the coil is really equivalent to an inductance in series with some resistance, as shown in Fig."
14583,23–2(a).
14584,"But, you are thinking, the resistance and inductance are together in a real coil—the resistance is spread all along the wire, so it is mixed in with the inductance."
14585,We should probably use a circuit more like the one in Fig.
14586,"As we go up in frequency with a real coil, the approximation of an inductance plus a resistance is no longer very good."
14587,The charges that must build up on the wires to make the voltages will become important.
14588,"It is as if there were little condensers across the turns of the coil, as sketched in Fig."
14589,23–3(a).
14590,We might try to approximate the real coil by the circuit in Fig.
14591,23–3(b).
14592,"At low frequencies, this circuit can be imitated fairly well by the simpler one in part (c) of the figure (which is again the same resonant circuit we found for the high-frequency model of a resistor)."
14593,"For higher frequencies, however, the more complicated circuit of Fig."
14594,23–3(b) is better.
14595,"In fact, the more accurately you wish to represent the actual impedance of a real, physical inductance, the more ideal elements you will have to use in the artificial model of it."
14596,Let’s look a little more closely at what goes on in a real coil.
14597,"As we go still higher, however, the capacities become important."
14598,"For small enough frequencies a condenser is an “open circuit,” and when it is in parallel with something else, it draws no current."
14599,"But at high frequencies, the current prefers to flow into the capacitance between the turns, rather than through the inductance."
14600,So the current in the coil jumps from one turn to the other and doesn’t bother to go around and around where it has to buck the emf.
14601,"So although we may have intended that the current should go around the loop, it will take the easier path—the path of least impedance."
14602,"If the subject had been one of popular interest, this effect would have been called “the high-frequency barrier,” or some such name."
14603,The same kind of thing happens in all subjects.
14604,"In aerodynamics, if you try to make things go faster than the speed of sound when they were designed for lower speeds, they don’t work."
14605,It doesn’t mean that there is a great “barrier” there; it just means that the object should be redesigned.
14606,"So this coil which we designed as an “inductance” is not going to work as a good inductance, but as some other kind of thing at very high frequencies."
14607,"For high frequencies, we have to find a new design."
14608,"Now we want to discuss in detail the behavior of a capacitor—a geometrically ideal capacitor—as the frequency gets larger and larger, so we can see the transition of its properties."
14609,"(We prefer to use a capacitor instead of an inductance, because the geometry of a pair of plates is much less complicated than the geometry of a coil.)"
14610,We consider the capacitor shown in Fig.
14611,"23–4(a), which consists of two parallel circular plates connected to an external generator by a pair of wires."
14612,"If we charge the capacitor with dc, there will be a positive charge on one plate and a negative charge on the other; and there will be a uniform electric field between the plates."
14613,"Now suppose that instead of dc, we put an ac of low frequency on the plates."
14614,(We will find out later what is “low” and what is “high”.)
14615,Say we connect the capacitor to a lower-frequency generator.
14616,"As the voltage alternates, the positive charge on the top plate is taken off and negative charge is put on."
14617,"While that is happening, the electric field disappears and then builds up in the opposite direction."
14618,"As the charge sloshes back and forth slowly, the electric field follows."
14619,"At each instant the electric field is uniform, as shown in Fig."
14620,"23–4(b), except for some edge effects which we are going to disregard."
14621,Now will that continue to be right as the frequency goes up?
14622,23–4(a).
14623,"And, as you know, a changing electric field acts to produce a magnetic field."
14624,"One of Maxwell’s equations says that when there is a varying electric field, as there is here, there has got to be a line integral of the magnetic field."
14625,That’s not very hard.
14626,We can see from symmetry that the magnetic field goes around as shown in the figure.
14627,What is the effect of that?
14628,"When there is a magnetic field that is varying, there will be induced electric fields and the capacitor will begin to act a little bit like an inductance."
14629,Let’s continue to raise the frequency and to analyze what happens more carefully.
14630,We have a magnetic field that goes sloshing back and forth.
14631,"But then the electric field cannot be uniform, as we have assumed!"
14632,"When there is a varying magnetic field, there must be a line integral of the electric field—because of Faraday’s law."
14633,"So if there is an appreciable magnetic field, as begins to happen at high frequencies, the electric field cannot be the same at all distances from the center."
14634,Let’s see if we can figure out the correct electric field.
14635,We can do that by computing a “correction” to the uniform field we originally assumed for low frequencies.
14636,23–4(b).
14637,Using Eq.
14638,The electric field in the capacitor is no longer uniform; it has the parabolic shape shown by the broken line in Fig.
14639,23–5.
14640,You see that our simple capacitor is getting slightly complicated.
14641,We could now use our results to calculate the impedance of the capacitor at high frequencies.
14642,We are more interested in seeing what happens as we continue to go up with the frequency—to see what happens at even higher frequencies.
14643,Aren’t we already finished?
14644,"No, because we have corrected the electric field, which means that the magnetic field we have calculated is no longer right."
14645,The magnetic field of Eq.
14646,"(23.5) is approximately right, but it is only a first approximation."
14647,We should then rewrite Eq.
14648,We will just have Eq.
14649,But we are still not finished!
14650,We can use Eq.
14651,We are not quite through yet.
14652,"The new electric field produces a new correction to the magnetic field, and the newly corrected magnetic field will produce a further correction to the electric field, and on and on."
14653,"However, we already have all the formulas that we need."
14654,It always comes up whenever you solve a problem about waves with cylindrical symmetry.
14655,"So it is an important function, invented a long time ago."
14656,Then a man named Bessel got his name attached to it.
14657,The subscript zero means that Bessel invented a whole lot of different functions and this is just the first of them.
14658,"The completely corrected electric field between the plates of our circular capacitor, given by Eq."
14659,"(23.17), is plotted as the solid line in Fig."
14660,23–5.
14661,"For frequencies that are not too high, our second approximation was already quite good."
14662,"The third approximation was even better—so good, in fact, that if we had plotted it, you would not have been able to see the difference between it and the solid curve."
14663,"You will see in the next section, however, that the complete series is needed to get an accurate description for large radii, or for high frequencies."
14664,We want to look now at what our solution gives for the electric field between the plates of the capacitor as we continue to go to higher and higher frequencies.
14665,That means that the parabola we have drawn in Fig.
14666,23–5 curves downward more steeply at higher frequencies.
14667,We have worked it out by hand to show you that you too could have discovered these things rather than having to borrow them from a book.
14668,23–6.
14669,"We have gotten the following interesting result: If we go high enough in frequency, the electric field at the center of our condenser will be one way and the electric field near the edge will point in the opposite direction."
14670,23–6.
14671,"At the edge of the plates, the electric field will have a rather high magnitude opposite the direction we would expect."
14672,That is the terrible thing that can happen to a capacitor at high frequencies.
14673,"If we go to very high frequencies, the direction of the electric field oscillates back and forth many times as we go out from the center of the capacitor."
14674,Also there are the magnetic fields associated with these electric fields.
14675,It is not surprising that our capacitor doesn’t look like the ideal capacitance for high frequencies.
14676,We may even start to wonder whether it looks more like a capacitor or an inductance.
14677,We should emphasize that there are even more complicated effects that we have neglected which happen at the edges of the capacitor.
14678,"For instance, there will be a radiation of waves out past the edges, so the fields are even more complicated than the ones we have computed, but we will not worry about those effects now."
14679,"We could try to figure out an equivalent circuit for the capacitor, but perhaps it is better if we just admit that the capacitor we have designed for low-frequency fields is just no longer satisfactory when the frequency is too high."
14680,"If we want to treat the operation of such an object at high frequencies, we should abandon the approximations to Maxwell’s equations that we have made for treating circuits and return to the complete set of equations which describe completely the fields in space."
14681,"Instead of dealing with idealized circuit elements, we have to deal with the real conductors as they are, taking into account all the fields in the spaces in between."
14682,"For instance, if we want a resonant circuit at high frequencies we will not try to design one using a coil and a parallel-plate capacitor."
14683,We have already mentioned that the parallel-plate capacitor we have been analyzing has some of the aspects of both a capacitor and an inductance.
14684,"With the electric field there are charges on the surfaces of the plates, and with the magnetic fields there are back emf’s."
14685,Is it possible that we already have a resonant circuit?
14686,We do indeed.
14687,Everywhere on a circle coaxial with the plates the electric field will be zero.
14688,Now suppose we take a thin metal sheet and cut a strip just wide enough to fit between the plates of the capacitor.
14689,Then we bend it into a cylinder that will go around at the radius where the electric field is zero.
14690,"Since there are no electric fields there, when we put this conducting cylinder in place, no currents will flow in it; and there will be no changes in the electric and magnetic fields."
14691,We have been able to put a direct short circuit across the capacitor without changing anything.
14692,And look what we have; we have a complete cylindrical can with electrical and magnetic fields inside and no connection at all to the outside world.
14693,"The fields inside won’t change even if we throw away the edges of the plates outside our can, and also the capacitor leads."
14694,"All we have left is a closed can with electric and magnetic fields inside, as shown in Fig."
14695,23–7(a).
14696,23–7(b).
14697,This curve is just the first arch of the Bessel function of zero order.
14698,"We can also write out a series for the magnetic field and plot it, as shown in the graph of Fig."
14699,23–7(c).
14700,How is it that we can have an electric and magnetic field inside a can with no external connections?
14701,"The magnetic field has an inductive aspect, and the electric field a capacitive aspect; together they make something like a resonant circuit."
14702,"For a can of a given radius, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields will maintain themselves—in the way we have described—only at that particular frequency."
14703,We have said that the fields continue to oscillate in the same way after the can is completely closed.
14704,That is not exactly right.
14705,It would be possible if the walls of the can were perfect conductors.
14706,"For a real can, however, the oscillating currents which exist on the inside walls of the can lose energy because of the resistance of the material."
14707,The oscillations of the fields will gradually die away.
14708,We can see from Fig.
14709,23–7 that there must be strong currents associated with electric and magnetic fields inside the cavity.
14710,"Because the vertical electrical field stops suddenly at the top and bottom plates of the can, it has a large divergence there; so there must be positive and negative electric charges on the inner surfaces of the can, as shown in Fig."
14711,23–7(a).
14712,"When the electric field reverses, the charges must reverse also, so there must be an alternating current between the top and bottom plates of the can."
14713,"These charges will flow in the sides of the can, as shown in the figure."
14714,We can also see that there must be currents in the sides of the can by considering what happens to the magnetic field.
14715,The graph of Fig.
14716,23–7(c) tells us that the magnetic field suddenly drops to zero at the edge of the can.
14717,Such a sudden change in the magnetic field can happen only if there is a current in the wall.
14718,This current is what gives the alternating electric charges on the top and bottom plates of the can.
14719,You may be wondering about our discovery of currents in the vertical sides of the can.
14720,What about our earlier statement that nothing would be changed when we introduced these vertical sides in a region where the electric field was zero?
14721,"Remember, however, that when we first put in the sides of the can, the top and bottom plates extended out beyond them, so that there were also magnetic fields on the outside of our can."
14722,It was only when we threw away the parts of the capacitor plates beyond the edges of the can that net currents had to appear on the insides of the vertical walls.
14723,"Although the electric and magnetic fields in the completely enclosed can will gradually die away because of the energy losses, we can stop this from happening if we make a little hole in the can and put in a little bit of electrical energy to make up the losses."
14724,"We take a small wire, poke it through the hole in the side of the can, and fasten it to the inside wall so that it makes a small loop, as shown in Fig."
14725,23–8.
14726,"If we now connect this wire to a source of high-frequency alternating current, this current will couple energy into the electric and magnetic fields of the cavity and keep the oscillations going."
14727,"This will happen, of course, only if the frequency of the driving source is at the resonant frequency of the can."
14728,"If the source is at the wrong frequency, the electric and magnetic fields will not resonate, and the fields in the can will be very weak."
14729,"The resonant behavior can easily be seen by making another small hole in the can and hooking in another coupling loop, as we have also drawn in Fig."
14730,23–8.
14731,The changing magnetic field through this loop will generate an induced electromotive force in the loop.
14732,"If this loop is now connected to some external measuring circuit, the currents will be proportional to the strength of the fields in the cavity."
14733,"Suppose we now connect the input loop of our cavity to an RF signal generator, as shown in Fig."
14734,23–9.
14735,The signal generator contains a source of alternating current whose frequency can be varied by varying the knob on the front of the generator.
14736,"Then we connect the output loop of the cavity to a “detector,” which is an instrument that measures the current from the output loop."
14737,It gives a meter reading proportional to this current.
14738,"If we now measure the output current as a function of the frequency of the signal generator, we find a curve like that shown in Fig."
14739,23–10.
14740,The resonance curve is very much like those we described in Chapter 23 of Vol.
14741,I.
14742,Suppose we now try to check our theory by making measurements with an actual can.
14743,"The can is fitted with an input and output loop, as shown in Fig."
14744,23–8.
14745,If we calculate the resonant frequency expected for this can according to Eq.
14746,There are several possible reasons for the discrepancy.
14747,Perhaps the resonant frequency is changed a little bit because of the holes we have cut to put in the coupling loops.
14748,"A little thought, however, shows that the holes should lower the resonant frequency a little bit, so that cannot be the reason."
14749,"Perhaps there is some slight error in the frequency calibration of the signal generator, or perhaps our measurement of the diameter of the cavity is not accurate enough."
14750,"Anyway, the agreement is fairly close."
14751,When we do that we get the results shown in Fig.
14752,23–11.
14753,What do these extra resonances mean?
14754,We might get a clue from Fig.
14755,23–6.
14756,"Although we have been assuming that the first zero of the Bessel function occurs at the edge of the can, it could also be that the second zero of the Bessel function corresponds to the edge of the can, so that there is one complete oscillation of the electric field as we move from the center of the can out to the edge, as shown in Fig."
14757,23–12.
14758,This is another possible mode for the oscillating fields.
14759,We should certainly expect the can to resonate in such a mode.
14760,The trouble is that in our analysis of the behavior of a resonant cavity we have considered only one possible geometric arrangement of the electric and magnetic fields.
14761,We have assumed that the electric fields are vertical and that the magnetic fields lie in horizontal circles.
14762,But other fields are possible.
14763,The only requirements are that the fields should satisfy Maxwell’s equations inside the can and that the electric field should meet the wall at right angles.
14764,"We have considered the case in which the top and the bottom of the can are flat, but things would not be completely different if the top and bottom were curved."
14765,"In fact, how is the can supposed to know which is its top and bottom, and which are its sides?"
14766,"It is, in fact, possible to show that there is a mode of oscillation of the fields inside the can in which the electric fields go more or less across the diameter of the can, as shown in Fig."
14767,23–13.
14768,It is not too hard to understand why the natural frequency of this mode should be not very different from the natural frequency of the first mode we have considered.
14769,"It is clear that this cavity would have three different modes, but all with the same frequency."
14770,A mode with the electric field going more or less up and down would certainly have the same frequency as the mode in which the electric field was directed right and left.
14771,"If we now distort the cube into a cylinder, we will change these frequencies somewhat."
14772,"We would still expect them not to be changed too much, provided we keep the dimensions of the cavity more or less the same."
14773,So the frequency of the mode of Fig.
14774,23–13 should not be too different from the mode of Fig.
14775,23–8.
14776,We could make a detailed calculation of the natural frequency of the mode shown in Fig.
14777,"23–13, but we will not do that now."
14778,"For this mode, the electric and magnetic fields are as shown in Fig."
14779,23–14.
14780,The electric field does not bother to go all the way across the cavity.
14781,"It goes from the sides to the ends, as shown."
14782,"As you will probably now believe, if we go higher and higher in frequency we should expect to find more and more resonances."
14783,"There are many different modes, each of which will have a different resonant frequency corresponding to some particular complicated arrangement of the electric and magnetic fields."
14784,Each of these field arrangements is called a resonant mode.
14785,The resonance frequency of each mode can be calculated by solving Maxwell’s equations for the electric and magnetic fields in the cavity.
14786,"When we have a resonance at some particular frequency, how can we know which mode is being excited?"
14787,One way is to poke a little wire into the cavity through a small hole.
14788,"If the electric field is along the wire, as in Fig."
14789,"23–15(a), there will be relatively large currents in the wire, sapping energy from the fields, and the resonance will be suppressed."
14790,If the electric field is as shown in Fig.
14791,"23–15(b), the wire will have a much smaller effect."
14792,"We could find which way the field points in this mode by bending the end of the wire, as shown in Fig."
14793,23–15(c).
14794,"Although the resonant cavity we have been describing seems to be quite different from the ordinary resonant circuit consisting of an inductance and a capacitor, the two resonant systems are, of course, closely related."
14795,They are both members of the same family; they are just two extreme cases of electromagnetic resonators—and there are many intermediate cases between these two extremes.
14796,"Suppose we start by considering the resonant circuit of a capacitor in parallel with an inductance, as shown in Fig."
14797,23–16(a).
14798,One way is to decrease the number of turns in the coil.
14799,"We can, however, go only so far in this direction."
14800,"Eventually we will get down to the last turn, and we will have just a piece of wire joining the top and bottom plates of the condenser."
14801,"We could raise the resonant frequency still further by making the capacitance smaller; however, we can also continue to decrease the inductance by putting several inductances in parallel."
14802,Two one-turn inductances in parallel will have only half the inductance of each turn.
14803,"So when our inductance has been reduced to a single turn, we can continue to raise the resonant frequency by adding other single loops from the top plate to the bottom plate of the condenser."
14804,"For instance, Fig."
14805,"23–16(b) shows the condenser plates connected by six such “single-turn inductances.” If we continue to add many such pieces of wire, we can make the transition to the completely enclosed resonant system shown in part (c) of the figure, which is a drawing of the cross section of a cylindrically symmetrical object."
14806,Our inductance is now a cylindrical hollow can attached to the edges of the condenser plates.
14807,The electric and magnetic fields will be as shown in the figure.
14808,"Such an object is, of course, a resonant cavity."
14809,It is called a “loaded” cavity.
14810,If we want to make the frequency of the resonator in Fig.
14811,We then have just a cylindrical can; our resonant circuit has become the cavity resonator of Fig.
14812,23–7.
14813,23–16 the electric and magnetic fields are quite separate.
14814,"As we have gradually modified the resonant system to make higher and higher frequencies, the magnetic field has been brought closer and closer to the electric field until in the cavity resonator the two are quite intermixed."
14815,"Although the cavity resonators we have talked about in this chapter have been cylindrical cans, there is nothing magic about the cylindrical shape."
14816,A can of any shape will have resonant frequencies corresponding to various possible modes of oscillations of the electric and magnetic fields.
14817,"For example, the “cavity” shown in Fig."
14818,23–17 will have its own particular set of resonant frequencies—although they would be rather difficult to calculate.
14819,"In the last chapter we studied what happened to the lumped elements of circuits when they were operated at very high frequencies, and we were led to see that a resonant circuit could be replaced by a cavity with the fields resonating inside."
14820,"Another interesting technical problem is the connection of one object to another, so that electromagnetic energy can be transmitted between them."
14821,"In low-frequency circuits the connection is made with wires, but this method doesn’t work very well at high frequencies because the circuits would radiate energy into all the space around them, and it is hard to control where the energy will go."
14822,The fields spread out around the wires; the currents and voltages are not “guided” very well by the wires.
14823,In this chapter we want to look into the ways that objects can be interconnected at high frequencies.
14824,"At least, that’s one way of presenting our subject."
14825,Another way is to say that we have been discussing the behavior of waves in free space.
14826,Now it is time to see what happens when oscillating fields are confined in one or more dimensions.
14827,"We will discover the interesting new phenomenon when the fields are confined in only two dimensions and allowed to go free in the third dimension, they propagate in waves."
14828,These are “guided waves”—the subject of this chapter.
14829,We begin by working out the general theory of the transmission line.
14830,"The radiation could be stopped by surrounding the line with a metal pipe, but this method would not be practical for power lines because the voltages and currents used would require a very large, expensive, and heavy pipe."
14831,So simple “open lines” are used.
14832,For somewhat higher frequencies—say a few kilocycles—radiation can already be serious.
14833,"However, it can be reduced by using “twisted-pair” transmission lines, as is done for short-run telephone connections."
14834,"At higher frequencies, however, the radiation soon becomes intolerable, either because of power losses or because the energy appears in other circuits where it isn’t wanted."
14835,"For frequencies from a few kilocycles to some hundreds of megacycles, electromagnetic signals and power are usually transmitted via coaxial lines consisting of a wire inside a cylindrical “outer conductor” or “shield.” Although the following treatment will apply to a transmission line of two parallel conductors of any shape, we will carry it out referring to a coaxial line."
14836,"We take the simplest coaxial line that has a central conductor, which we suppose is a thin hollow cylinder, and an outer conductor which is another thin cylinder on the same axis as the inner conductor, as in Fig."
14837,24–1.
14838,We begin by figuring out approximately how the line behaves at relatively low frequencies.
14839,We have already described some of the low-frequency behavior when we said earlier that two such conductors had a certain amount of inductance per unit length or a certain capacity per unit length.
14840,"Using our results for the infinite filter, we see that there would be a propagation of electric signals along the line."
14841,"Rather than following that approach, however, we would now rather look at the line from the point of view of a differential equation."
14842,24–2).
14843,Equations (24.1) and (24.2) are then the basic equations of a transmission line.
14844,"If we wish, we could modify them to include the effects of resistance in the conductors or of leakage of charge through the insulation between the conductors, but for our present discussion we will just stay with the simple example."
14845,"For a uniform transmission line, the voltage (and current) propagates along the line as a wave."
14846,"We can calculate them easily for a coaxial cable, so we will see how that goes."
14847,We have worked out the charge on a cylindrical condenser (see Section 12–2).
14848,Combining this result with Eq.
14849,The wave travels down the line with the speed of light.
14850,"We point out that this result depends on our assumptions: (a) that there are no dielectrics or magnetic materials in the space between the conductors, and (b) that the currents are all on the surfaces of the conductors (as they would be for perfect conductors)."
14851,"We will see later that for good conductors at high frequencies, all currents distribute themselves on the surfaces as they would for a perfect conductor, so this assumption is then valid."
14852,"So long as the cross section is constant and the space between has no material, waves are propagated at the velocity of light."
14853,No such general statement can be made about the characteristic impedance.
14854,"The next thing we want to talk about seems, at first sight, to be a striking phenomenon: if the central conductor is removed from the coaxial line, it can still carry electromagnetic power."
14855,"In other words, at high enough frequencies a hollow tube will work just as well as one with wires."
14856,It is related to the mysterious way in which a resonant circuit of a condenser and inductance gets replaced by nothing but a can at high frequencies.
14857,"Although it may seem to be a remarkable thing when one has been thinking in terms of a transmission line as a distributed inductance and capacity, we all know that electromagnetic waves can travel along inside a hollow metal pipe."
14858,"If the pipe is straight, we can see through it!"
14859,So certainly electromagnetic waves go through a pipe.
14860,But we also know that it is not possible to transmit low-frequency waves (power or telephone) through the inside of a single metal pipe.
14861,So it must be that electromagnetic waves will go through if their wavelength is short enough.
14862,Therefore we want to discuss the limiting case of the longest wavelength (or the lowest frequency) that can get through a pipe of a given size.
14863,"Since the pipe is then being used to carry waves, it is called a waveguide."
14864,"We will begin with a rectangular pipe, because it is the simplest case to analyze."
14865,We will first give a mathematical treatment and come back later to look at the problem in a much more elementary way.
14866,"The more elementary approach, however, can be applied easily only to a rectangular guide."
14867,"The basic phenomena are the same for a general guide of arbitrary shape, so the mathematical argument is fundamentally more sound."
14868,"Our problem, then, is to find what kind of waves can exist inside a rectangular pipe."
14869,24–3.
14870,24–4.
14871,Perhaps it is the Bessel function we found for a cavity?
14872,"No, because the Bessel function has to do with cylindrical geometries."
14873,I).
14874,Let’s see whether this guess satisfies the correct field equations.
14875,"First, the electric field should have no tangential components at the conductors."
14876,Our field satisfies this requirement; it is perpendicular to the top and bottom faces and is zero at the two side faces.
14877,"Finally, our electric field must agree with the rest of Maxwell’s equations in the free space inside the guide."
14878,"(24.12), will work."
14879,"Besides the electric fields there are magnetic fields that will travel with the wave, but we will not bother to work out an expression for them right now."
14880,24–6.
14881,In solving Eq.
14882,"Naturally, it should be possible for waves to go in either direction."
14883,"Since both types of waves can be present at the same time, there will be the possibility of standing-wave solutions."
14884,"But now notice that if we go toward low frequencies, something strange happens."
14885,(24.20) suddenly becomes negative.
14886,Or do we?
14887,What if it does come out imaginary?
14888,Our field equations are still satisfied.
14889,"In our derivation we didn’t worry about the sources that started the waves, but there must, of course, be a source someplace in the guide."
14890,Looking at Eq.
14891,24–7.
14892,The fields penetrate very little distance from the source.
14893,"Normally, if we solve an equation in physics and get an imaginary number, it doesn’t mean anything physical."
14894,"For waves, however, an imaginary wave number does mean something."
14895,The wave equation is still satisfied; it only means that the solution gives exponentially decreasing fields instead of propagating waves.
14896,"The wave velocity we have used above is the phase velocity, which is the speed of a node of the wave; it is a function of frequency."
14897,If we combine Eqs.
14898,We have already seen in Chapter 48 of Vol.
14899,"I that phase velocities greater than light are possible, because it is just the nodes of the wave which are moving and not energy or information."
14900,"In order to know how fast signals will travel, we have to calculate the speed of pulses or modulations made by the interference of a wave of one frequency with one or more waves of slightly different frequencies (see Chapter 48, Vol."
14901,I).
14902,(24.17) … Interesting!
14903,The group velocity of the waves is also the speed at which energy is transported along the guide.
14904,"If we want to find the energy flow down the guide, we can get it from the energy density times the group velocity."
14905,There is also some energy associated with the magnetic field.
14906,"Energy can be coupled into a waveguide by some kind of an “antenna.” For example, a little vertical wire or “stub” will do."
14907,"The presence of the guided waves can be observed by picking up some of the electromagnetic energy with a little receiving “antenna,” which again can be a little stub of wire or a small loop."
14908,In Fig.
14909,"24–8, we show a guide with some cutaways to show a driving stub and a pickup “probe”."
14910,"The driving stub can be connected to a signal generator via a coaxial cable, and the pickup probe can be connected by a similar cable to a detector."
14911,"It is usually convenient to insert the pickup probe via a long thin slot in the guide, as shown in Fig."
14912,24–8.
14913,Then the probe can be moved back and forth along the guide to sample the fields at various positions.
14914,"These will be the only waves present if the guide is infinitely long, which can effectively be arranged by terminating the guide with a carefully designed absorber in such a way that there are no reflections from the far end."
14915,"Then, since the detector measures the time average of the fields near the probe, it will pick up a signal which is independent of the position along the guide; its output will be proportional to the power being transmitted."
14916,"If now the far end of the guide is finished off in some way that produces a reflected wave—as an extreme example, if we closed it off with a metal plate—there will be a reflected wave in addition to the original forward wave."
14917,These two waves will interfere and produce a standing wave in the guide similar to the standing waves on a string which we discussed in Chapter 49 of Vol.
14918,I.
14919,"Then, as the pickup probe is moved along the line, the detector reading will rise and fall periodically, showing a maximum in the fields at each loop of the standing wave and a minimum at each node."
14920,This gives a convenient way of measuring the guide wavelength.
14921,(24.19).
14922,Then the detector output will decrease gradually as the pickup probe is moved down the guide.
14923,"If the frequency is set somewhat lower, the field strength will fall rapidly, following the curve of Fig."
14924,"24–7, and showing that waves are not propagated."
14925,"An important practical use of waveguides is for the transmission of high-frequency power, as, for example, in coupling the high-frequency oscillator or output amplifier of a radar set to an antenna."
14926,"In fact, the antenna itself usually consists of a parabolic reflector fed at its focus by a waveguide flared out at the end to make a “horn” that radiates the waves coming along the guide."
14927,"Although high frequencies can be transmitted along a coaxial cable, a waveguide is better for transmitting large amounts of power."
14928,"First, the maximum power that can be transmitted along a line is limited by the breakdown of the insulation (solid or gas) between the conductors."
14929,"For a given amount of power, the field strengths in a guide are usually less than they are in a coaxial cable, so higher powers can be transmitted before breakdown occurs."
14930,"Second, the power losses in the coaxial cable are usually greater than in a waveguide."
14931,"In a coaxial cable there must be insulating material to support the central conductor, and there is an energy loss in this material—particularly at high frequencies."
14932,"Also, the current densities on the central conductor are quite high, and since the losses go as the square of the current density, the lower currents that appear on the walls of the guide result in lower energy losses."
14933,"To keep these losses to a minimum, the inner surfaces of the guide are often plated with a material of high conductivity, such as silver."
14934,"The problem of connecting a “circuit” with waveguides is quite different from the corresponding circuit problem at low frequencies, and is usually called microwave “plumbing.” Many special devices have been developed for the purpose."
14935,"For instance, two sections of waveguide are usually connected together by means of flanges, as can be seen in Fig."
14936,24–9.
14937,"Such connections can, however, cause serious energy losses, because the surface currents must flow across the joint, which may have a relatively high resistance."
14938,One way to avoid such losses is to make the flanges as shown in the cross section drawn in Fig.
14939,24–10.
14940,"A small space is left between the adjacent sections of the guide, and a groove is cut in the face of one of the flanges to make a small cavity of the type shown in Fig."
14941,23–16(c).
14942,The dimensions are chosen so that this cavity is resonant at the frequency being used.
14943,24–10).
14944,Suppose you want to stop a waveguide in a way that won’t result in reflected waves.
14945,Then you must put something at the end that imitates an infinite length of guide.
14946,You need a “termination” which acts for the guide like the characteristic impedance does for a transmission line—something that absorbs the arriving waves without making reflections.
14947,Then the guide will act as though it went on forever.
14948,Such terminations are made by putting inside the guide some wedges of resistance material carefully designed to absorb the wave energy while generating almost no reflected waves.
14949,"If you want to connect three things together—for instance, one source to two different antennas—then you can use a “T” like the one shown in Fig."
14950,24–11.
14951,Power fed in at the center section of the “T” will be split and go out the two side arms (and there may also be some reflected waves).
14952,You can see qualitatively from the sketches in Fig.
14953,24–12 that the fields would spread out when they get to the end of the input section and make electric fields that will start waves going out the two arms.
14954,"Depending on whether electric fields in the guide are parallel or perpendicular to the “top” of the “T,” the fields at the junction would be roughly as shown in (a) or (b) of Fig."
14955,24–12.
14956,"Finally, we would like to describe a device called a “unidirectional coupler,” which is very useful for telling what is going on after you have connected a complicated arrangement of waveguides."
14957,"Suppose you want to know which way the waves are going in a particular section of guide—you might be wondering, for instance, whether or not there is a strong reflected wave."
14958,"The unidirectional coupler takes out a small fraction of the power of a guide if there is a wave going one way, but none if the wave is going the other way."
14959,"By connecting the output of the coupler to a detector, you can measure the “one-way” power in the guide."
14960,Each of the holes acts like a little antenna that produces a wave in the secondary guide.
14961,"If there were only one hole, waves would be sent in both directions and would be the same no matter which way the wave was going in the primary guide."
14962,Do you remember that we considered in Chapter 29 of Vol.
14963,We found that the waves subtract in one direction and add in the opposite direction.
14964,The same thing will happen here.
14965,"This end is equipped with a termination, so that this wave is absorbed and there is no wave at the output of the coupler."
14966,The wave we have chosen to analyze is a special solution of the field equations.
14967,There are many more.
14968,24–14.
14969,So such fields are called transverse magnetic (TM) modes.
14970,"For a rectangular guide, all the other modes have a higher cutoff frequency than the simple TE mode we have described."
14971,"It is, therefore, possible—and usual—to use a guide with a frequency just above the cutoff for this lowest mode but below the cutoff frequency for all the others, so that just the one mode is propagated."
14972,"Otherwise, the behavior gets complicated and difficult to control."
14973,Then you will have a more “physical” idea of why the behavior changes so drastically between low and high frequencies.
14974,We can do this for the rectangular guide by analyzing the fields in terms of reflections—or images—in the walls of the guide.
14975,"The approach only works for rectangular guides, however; that’s why we started with the more mathematical analysis which works, in principle, for guides of any shape."
14976,In the absence of the guide walls such a wire would radiate cylindrical waves.
14977,Now we consider that the guide walls are perfect conductors.
14978,"Then, just as in electrostatics, the conditions at the surface will be correct if we add to the field of the wire the field of one or more suitable image wires."
14979,"The image idea works just as well for electrodynamics as it does for electrostatics, provided, of course, that we also include the retardations."
14980,We know that is true because we have often seen a mirror producing an image of a light source.
14981,And a mirror is just a “perfect” conductor for electromagnetic waves with optical frequencies.
14982,"Now let’s take a horizontal cross section, as shown in Fig."
14983,We call the direction of the current in the wire positive.
14984,"(It is, in fact just what you would see if you looked at a wire placed halfway between two parallel mirrors.)"
14985,"For the fields to be zero at the walls, the polarity of the currents in the images must alternate from one image to the next."
14986,"The waveguide field is, then, just the superposition of the fields of such an infinite set of line sources."
14987,"We know that if we are close to the sources, the field is very much like the static fields."
14988,We considered in Section 7–5 the static field of a grid of line sources and found that it is like the field of a charged plate except for terms that decrease exponentially with the distance from the grid.
14989,"Here the average source strength is zero, because the sign alternates from one source to the next."
14990,Any fields which exist should fall off exponentially with distance.
14991,"Close to the source, we see the field mainly of the nearest source; at large distances, many sources contribute and their average effect is zero."
14992,So now we see why the waveguide below cutoff frequency gives an exponentially decreasing field.
14993,"At low frequencies, in particular, the static approximation is good, and it predicts a rapid attenuation of the fields with distance."
14994,Now we are faced with the opposite question: Why are waves propagated at all?
14995,That is the mysterious part!
14996,The reason is that at high frequencies the retardation of the fields can introduce additional changes in phase which can cause the fields of the out-of-phase sources to add instead of cancelling.
14997,"In fact, in Chapter 29 of Vol."
14998,"I we have already studied, just for this problem, the fields generated by an array of antennas or by an optical grating."
14999,"There we found that when several radio antennas are suitably arranged, they can give an interference pattern that has a strong signal in some direction but no signal in another."
15000,Suppose we go back to Fig.
15001,24–15 and look at the fields which arrive at a large distance from the array of image sources.
15002,The fields will be strong only in certain directions which depend on the frequency—only in those directions for which the fields from all the sources add in phase.
15003,At a reasonable distance from the sources the field propagates in these special directions as plane waves.
15004,We have sketched such a wave in Fig.
15005,"24–16, where the solid lines represent the wave crests and the dashed lines represent the troughs."
15006,The wave direction will be the one for which the difference in the retardation for two neighboring sources to the crest of a wave corresponds to one-half a period of oscillation.
15007,"There is, of course, another set of waves travelling downward at the symmetric angle with respect to the array of sources."
15008,"The complete waveguide field (not too close to the source) is the superposition of these two sets of waves, as shown in Fig."
15009,24–17.
15010,"The actual fields are really like this, of course, only between the two walls of the waveguide."
15011,(24.19).
15012,24–16 can appear.
15013,"If the frequency is high enough, there can be two or more possible directions in which the waves will appear."
15014,These additional waves correspond to the higher guide modes we have mentioned.
15015,"24–16 changes, and therefore so does the velocity along the guide."
15016,"Although we have described the guided wave as the superposition of the fields of an infinite array of line sources, you can see that we would arrive at the same result if we imagined two sets of free-space waves being continually reflected back and forth between two perfect mirrors—remembering that a reflection means a reversal of phase."
15017,(24.33).
15018,There are many ways of looking at the same thing.
15019,"(The photos for chapter 25, which includes the summary for this lecture, are missing from the Caltech Archives.)"
15020,We now discuss the application of the special theory of relativity to electrodynamics.
15021,Since we have already studied the special theory of relativity in Chapters 15 through 17 of Vol.
15022,"I, we will just review quickly the basic ideas."
15023,It is found experimentally that the laws of physics are unchanged if we move with uniform velocity.
15024,"You can’t tell if you are inside a spaceship moving with uniform velocity in a straight line, unless you look outside the spaceship, or at least make an observation having to do with the world outside."
15025,Any true law of physics we write down must be arranged so that this fact of nature is built in.
15026,This is just like the principle that the laws of physics don’t depend on the orientation of our coordinate system.
15027,In Chapter 11 of Vol.
15028,"I, we saw that the way to describe mathematically the invariance of physics with respect to rotations was to write our equations in terms of vectors."
15029,"With this operator we defined the gradient, and in combination with other vectors, the divergence and the Laplacian."
15030,Finally we discovered that by taking sums of certain products of pairs of the components of two vectors we could get three new quantities which behaved like a new vector.
15031,We called it the cross product of two vectors.
15032,"Since we will be referring back to what we have done in vector analysis, we have put in Table 25–1 a summary of all the important vector operations in three dimensions that we have used in the past."
15033,The point is that it must be possible to write the equations of physics so that both sides transform the same way under rotations.
15034,"If one side is a vector, the other side must also be a vector, and both sides will change together in exactly the same way if we rotate our coordinate system."
15035,"Similarly, if one side is a scalar, the other side must also be a scalar, so that neither side changes when we rotate coordinates, and so on."
15036,"Now in the case of special relativity, time and space are inextricably mixed, and we must do the analogous things for four dimensions."
15037,"We want our equations to remain the same not only for rotations, but also for any inertial frame."
15038,That means that our equations should be invariant under the Lorentz transformation of equations (25.1).
15039,The purpose of this chapter is to show you how that can be done.
15040,"Before we get started, however, we want to do something that makes our work a lot easier (and saves some confusion)."
15041,"We can even call this time unit “one meter.”  Using this unit, all of our equations will show more clearly the space-time symmetry."
15042,With this groundwork we are ready to begin.
15043,Our program is to do in the four dimensions of space-time all of the things we did with vectors for three dimensions.
15044,It is really quite a simple game; we just work by analogy.
15045,The only real complication is the notation (we’ve already used up the vector symbol for three dimensions) and one slight twist of signs.
15046,"We have already encountered one four-vector, which consists of the energy and momentum of a particle (Chapter 17, Vol."
15047,"It looks as though the game is really very simple—for each three-vector in physics all we have to do is find what the remaining component should be, and we have a four-vector."
15048,Instinct should give the right answer.
15049,(Dividing by an invariant scalar doesn’t change the transformation properties.)
15050,"(The right-hand side is an invariant times a four-vector, which is still a four-vector.)"
15051,"It is an accident of life, if you wish, that under coordinate rotations the distance of a point from the origin does not change."
15052,There is.
15053,From Eq.
15054,Then any Lorentz transformation plus a rotation will leave the quantity unchanged.
15055,Now since this invariance is an algebraic matter depending only on the transformation rules of Eq.
15056,(25.1)—plus rotations—it is true for any four-vector (by definition they all transform the same).
15057,(We have in fact already proved this in Chapter 17 of Vol.
15058,I.)
15059,Clearly this expression is quite analogous to the dot product for vectors.
15060,"We will, in fact, call it the dot product or scalar product of two four-vectors."
15061,"But, unhappily, it’s not done that way; it is usually written without the dot."
15062,We will now give you an illustration of the usefulness of four-vector dot products.
15063,The easiest way to get the answer is to consider what the reaction looks like in the center-of-mass (CM) system (see Fig.
15064,25–1).
15065,"If the incident proton has just barely enough energy to make the reaction go, the final state—the situation after the collision—will consist of a glob containing three protons and an antiproton at rest in the CM system."
15066,"If the incident energy were slightly higher, the final state particles would have some kinetic energy and be moving apart; if the incident energy were slightly lower, there would not be enough energy to make the four particles."
15067,"Now the important thing is that this is an equation among four-vectors, and is, therefore, true in any inertial frame."
15068,We can use this fact to simplify our calculations.
15069,We start by taking the “length” of each side of Eq.
15070,"(25.9); they are, of course, also equal."
15071,"Thus, Eq."
15072,Using these results in Eq.
15073,"Since scalar products are invariant, they are always interesting to evaluate."
15074,The next thing that we have to discuss is the four-dimensional analog of the gradient.
15075,"We recall (Chapter 14, Vol."
15076,This is wrong.
15077,(25.1).
15078,Now we can see that the gradient is rather strange.
15079,But Eqs.
15080,(25.14) and (25.15) have a couple of signs wrong!
15081,"(It’s rather awkward to have those minus signs, but that’s the way the world is.)"
15082,"All right, now that we have vectors, gradients, and dot products, the next thing is to look for an invariant which is analogous to the divergence of three-dimensional vector analysis."
15083,Note that one has to be careful with the signs.
15084,"Some of the minus signs come from the definition of the scalar product, Eq."
15085,(25.16).
15086,The divergence as defined by (25.17) is an invariant and gives the same answer in all coordinate systems which differ by a Lorentz transformation.
15087,Let’s look at a physical example in which the four-divergence shows up.
15088,We can use it to solve the problem of the fields around a moving wire.
15089,These are just what we found in Chapter 13.
15090,We can then use these sources in Maxwell’s equations in the moving system to find the fields.
15091,"The charge conservation law, Section 13-2, also takes on a simple form in the four-vector notation."
15092,"We have the result that if charge is conserved in one coordinate system, it is conserved in all coordinate systems moving with uniform velocity."
15093,That’s easy.
15094,(Some people define the d’Alembertian with the opposite sign to Eq.
15095,"(25.20), so you will have to be careful when reading the literature.)"
15096,We have now found four-dimensional equivalents of most of the three-dimensional quantities we had listed in Table 25–1.
15097,(We do not yet have the equivalents of the cross product and the curl operation; we won’t get to them until the next chapter.)
15098,"It may help you remember how they go if we put all the important definitions and results together in one place, so we have made such a summary in Table 25–2."
15099,What we call the scalar and vector potentials are really different aspects of the same physical thing.
15100,They belong together.
15101,And if they are kept together the relativistic invariance of the world is obvious.
15102,In the four-vector notation Eqs.
15103,But there is some pleasure in being able to rewrite them in an elegant form.
15104,The pretty form is also meaningful; it shows directly the invariance of electrodynamics under the Lorentz transformation.
15105,Remember that Eqs.
15106,This condition is called the Lorenz condition.
15107,It is very convenient because it is an invariant condition and therefore Maxwell’s equations stay in the form of Eq.
15108,(25.22) for all frames.
15109,We will consider one example of the usefulness of the idea of the four-potential.
15110,"The problem is easy in a coordinate system moving with the charge, since in this system the charge is standing still."
15111,25–2.
15112,The inverse relations to Eqs.
15113,(25.22).
15114,"This equation, together with the conservation of charge, Eq."
15115,"Did we learn anything from writing the equations this way, besides that they are beautiful and simple?"
15116,"In the first place, is it anything different from what we had before when we wrote everything out in all the various components?"
15117,Can we from this equation deduce something that could not be deduced from the wave equations for the potentials in terms of the charges and currents?
15118,The answer is definitely no.
15119,The only thing we have been doing is changing the names of things—using a new notation.
15120,What then is the significance of the fact that the equations can be written in this simple form?
15121,"From the point of view of deducing anything directly, it doesn’t mean anything."
15122,"Perhaps, though, the simplicity of the equations means that nature also has a certain simplicity."
15123,Let us show you something interesting that we have recently discovered: All of the laws of physics can be contained in one equation.
15124,"Of course, it is necessary to know what the symbol means."
15125,And we have a formula for it.
15126,Here is how you calculate the unworldliness.
15127,You take all of the known physical laws and write them in a special form.
15128,So the “beautifully simple” law in Eq.
15129,(25.32) is equivalent to the whole series of equations that you originally wrote down.
15130,It is therefore absolutely obvious that a simple notation that just hides the complexity in the definitions of symbols is not real simplicity.
15131,It is just a trick.
15132,The beauty that appears in Eq.
15133,(25.32)—just from the fact that several equations are hidden within it—is no more than a trick.
15134,"When you unwrap the whole thing, you get back where you were before."
15135,"However, there is more to the simplicity of the laws of electromagnetism written in the form of Eq."
15136,(25.29).
15137,"It means more, just as a theory of vector analysis means more."
15138,"The fact that the electromagnetic equations can be written in a very particular notation which was designed for the four-dimensional geometry of the Lorentz transformations—in other words, as a vector equation in the four-space—means that it is invariant under the Lorentz transformations."
15139,It is because the Maxwell equations are invariant under those transformations that they can be written in a beautiful form.
15140,It is no accident that the equations of electrodynamics can be written in the beautifully elegant form of Eq.
15141,(25.29).
15142,The theory of relativity was developed because it was found experimentally that the phenomena predicted by Maxwell’s equations were the same in all inertial systems.
15143,And it was precisely by studying the transformation properties of Maxwell’s equations that Lorentz discovered his transformation as the one which left the equations invariant.
15144,"There is, however, another reason for writing our equations this way."
15145,It has been discovered—after Einstein guessed that it might be so—that all of the laws of physics are invariant under the Lorentz transformation.
15146,That is the principle of relativity.
15147,"Therefore, if we invent a notation which shows immediately when a law is written down whether it is invariant or not, we can be sure that in trying to make new theories we will write only equations which are consistent with the principle of relativity."
15148,"The fact that the Maxwell equations are simple in this particular notation is not a miracle, because the notation was invented with them in mind."
15149,"But the interesting physical thing is that every law of physics—the propagation of meson waves or the behavior of neutrinos in beta decay, and so forth—must have this same invariance under the same transformation."
15150,"Then when you are moving at a uniform velocity in a spaceship, all of the laws of nature transform together in such a way that no new phenomenon will show up."
15151,It is because the principle of relativity is a fact of nature that in the notation of four-dimensional vectors the equations of the world will look simple.
15152,We also worked out the potentials of a particle moving with uniform speed on a straight line by using the Lorentz transformation.
15153,(We had already found them by another method in Chapter 21.)
15154,26–1).
15155,"In fact, if we make the added assumption that the potentials depend only upon the position and the velocity at the retarded moment, we have in equations (26.1) a complete formula for the potentials for a charge moving any way."
15156,It works this way.
15157,"Suppose that you have a charge moving in some arbitrary fashion, say with the trajectory in Fig."
15158,"You know, of course, that the moment that we have the formula for the potentials from a charge moving in any manner whatsoever, we have the complete electrodynamics; we can get the potentials of any charge distribution by superposition."
15159,Therefore we can summarize all the phenomena of electrodynamics either by writing Maxwell’s equations or by the following series of remarks.
15160,(Remember them in case you are ever on a desert island.
15161,"From them, all can be reconstructed."
15162,"You will, of course, know the Lorentz transformation; you will never forget that on a desert island or anywhere else.)"
15163,"Third, the potentials produced by a charge moving in any way depend only upon the velocity and position at the retarded time."
15164,With those three facts we have everything.
15165,"Then, by the last statement that potentials depend only upon the past velocity at the retarded time, we can use the projected position game to find them."
15166,"It is not a particularly useful way of doing things, but it is interesting to show that the laws of physics can be put in so many different ways."
15167,"It is sometimes said, by people who are careless, that all of electrodynamics can be deduced solely from the Lorentz transformation and Coulomb’s law."
15168,"Of course, that is completely false."
15169,"First, we have to suppose that there is a scalar potential and a vector potential that together make a four-vector."
15170,That tells us how the potentials transform.
15171,Then why is it that the effects at the retarded time are the only things that count?
15172,"Better yet, why is it that the potentials depend only on the position and the velocity and not, for instance, on the acceleration?"
15173,"If you try to make the same kind of an argument with respect to them, you would say that they depend only upon the position and velocity at the retarded time."
15174,But then the fields from an accelerating charge would be the same as the fields from a charge at the projected position—which is false.
15175,The fields depend not only on the position and the velocity along the path but also on the acceleration.
15176,So there are several additional tacit assumptions in this great statement that everything can be deduced from the Lorentz transformation.
15177,"(Whenever you see a sweeping statement that a tremendous amount can come from a very small number of assumptions, you always find that it is false."
15178,There are usually a large number of implied assumptions that are far from obvious if you think about them sufficiently carefully.)
15179,"Now that we have the potentials from a point charge moving at constant velocity, we ought to find the fields—for practical reasons."
15180,"There are many cases where we have uniformly moving particles—for instance, cosmic rays going through a cloud chamber, or even slow-moving electrons in a wire."
15181,So let’s at least see what the fields actually do look like for any speed—even for speeds nearly that of light—assuming only that there is no acceleration.
15182,It is an interesting question.
15183,Now let’s see what the fields look like.
15184,We will try to draw a picture of the field at various positions around the present position of the charge.
15185,"It is true that the influence of the charge comes, in a certain sense, from the retarded position; but because the motion is exactly specified, the retarded position is uniquely given in terms of the present position."
15186,26–3).
15187,From Eqs.
15188,26–3.
15189,"In short, the electric field is radial from the charge, and the field lines radiate directly out of the charge, just as they do for a stationary charge."
15190,But we can show something rather interesting.
15191,"If you do that, the field lines will be spread out ahead and behind the charge and will be squeezed together around the sides, as shown in Fig."
15192,26–4.
15193,"So at the sides of a moving charge, the electric field is stronger than you get from the Coulomb law."
15194,"In fact, the field in the sidewise direction is bigger than the Coulomb potential by the ratio of the energy of the particle to its rest mass."
15195,"But if a particle is moving very close to the speed of light, the field in the forward direction is enormously reduced, and the field in the sidewise direction is enormously increased."
15196,"Then, of course, the whole picture would be compressed by the Lorentz contraction; that is, the carbon granules on the paper would appear in different places."
15197,The miracle of it is that the picture you would see as the page flies by would still represent the field lines of the point charge.
15198,"The contraction moves them closer together at the sides and spreads them out ahead and behind, just in the right way to give the correct line densities."
15199,We have emphasized before that field lines are not real but are only one way of representing the field.
15200,"However, here they almost seem to be real."
15201,"In this particular case, if you make the mistake of thinking that the field lines are somehow really there in space, and transform them, you get the correct field."
15202,"That doesn’t, however, make the field lines any more real."
15203,"All you need do to remind yourself that they aren’t real is to think about the electric fields produced by a charge together with a magnet; when the magnet moves, new electric fields are produced, and destroy the beautiful picture."
15204,So the neat idea of the contracting picture doesn’t work in general.
15205,"It is, however, a handy way to remember what the fields from a fast-moving charge are like."
15206,(26.9)].
15207,26–5.
15208,So the right-hand side of Eq.
15209,"We would like to point out, in passing, something interesting for you to think about."
15210,(We will come back to discuss it again later.)
15211,"Imagine two protons with velocities at right angles, so that one will cross over the path of the other, but in front of it, so they don’t collide."
15212,"At some instant, their relative positions will be as in Fig."
15213,26–6(a).
15214,The forces are as drawn in Fig.
15215,26–6(b).
15216,Does action not equal reaction?
15217,We leave it for you to worry about.
15218,In the last section we calculated the electric and magnetic fields from the transformed potentials.
15219,"The fields are important, of course, in spite of the arguments given earlier that there is physical meaning and reality to the potentials."
15220,"The fields, too, are real."
15221,It would be convenient for many purposes to have a way to compute the fields in a moving system if you already know the fields in some “rest” system.
15222,It is a convenient transformation to have.
15223,"We could always work back through the potentials, but it is useful sometimes to be able to transform the fields directly."
15224,We will now see how that goes.
15225,How can we find the transformation laws of the fields?
15226,But it’s not so.
15227,It’s quite different from what you would expect.)
15228,"Well, almost—there is a sign wrong."
15229,What we have found is that there are six quantities that belong together in nature—that are different aspects of the same thing.
15230,The electric and magnetic fields which we have considered as separate vectors in our slow-moving world (where we don’t worry about the speed of light) are not vectors in four-space.
15231,That is the way we must look at it for relativity.
15232,You see that what we have done here is to generalize the cross product.
15233,"Let’s look for a moment at an ordinary cross product in three dimensions, for example, the angular momentum of a particle."
15234,I the miracle that these three quantities could be identified with the components of a vector.
15235,"In order to do so, we had to make an artificial rule with a right-hand convention."
15236,It was just luck.
15237,And it just happens that when you change coordinate systems these three objects transform in exactly the same way as the components of a vector.
15238,The same thing lets us represent an element of surface as a vector.
15239,But we can’t do that in four dimensions.
15240,"But in four dimensions that is evidently impossible, because there are six independent terms, and you can’t represent six things by four things."
15241,Even in three dimensions it is possible to have combinations of vectors that can’t be represented by vectors.
15242,"Such an object which has two indices to describe it, instead of one, is called a tensor."
15243,"It is a tensor of the “second rank,” because you can play this game with three vectors too and get a tensor of the third rank—or with four, to get a tensor of the fourth rank, and so on."
15244,A tensor of the first rank is a vector.
15245,"It is, however, a tensor in four dimensions."
15246,It transforms in a special way which we will work out in a moment—it is just the way a product of vectors transforms.
15247,That’s a special case—it is an antisymmetric tensor.
15248,So we say: the electric and magnetic fields are both part of an antisymmetric tensor of the second rank in four dimensions.
15249,You’ve come a long way.
15250,Remember way back when we defined what a velocity meant?
15251,Now we are talking about “an antisymmetric tensor of the second rank in four dimensions.”
15252,"It isn’t at all difficult to do; it’s just laborious—the brains involved are nil, but the work is not."
15253,We will do one more.
15254,So we have the transformation of the electric and magnetic fields.
15255,It’s just a matter of substitution.
15256,"So that we can see how it looks in the ordinary symbols, we’ll rewrite our transformation of the field components in Table 26–2."
15257,So we can rewrite the transformations as shown in Table 26–3.
15258,It is now easier to remember which components go where.
15259,Then we get the equations in Table 26–4.
15260,"The field transformations give us another way of solving some problems we have done before—for instance, for finding the fields of a moving point charge."
15261,We have worked out the fields before by differentiating the potentials.
15262,But we could now do it by transforming the Coulomb field.
15263,We will let you show that the transformations of Tables 26–3 and 26–4 give the same electric and magnetic fields we got in Section 26-2.
15264,The transformation of Table 26–2 gives us an interesting and simple answer for what we see if we move past any system of fixed charges.
15265,26–7.
15266,"(It is, of course, the same thing if we say that a charged condenser is moving past us.)"
15267,What do we see?
15268,"Let’s take the opposite case, and imagine we are moving through a pure static magnetic field."
15269,"As one example of this effect, consider this once famous problem of determining the speed of an airplane."
15270,"It’s no longer famous, since radar can now be used to determine the air speed from ground reflections, but for many years it was very hard to find the speed of an airplane in bad weather."
15271,"You could not see the ground and you didn’t know which way was up, and so on."
15272,Yet it was important to know how fast you were moving relative to the earth.
15273,How can this be done without seeing the earth?
15274,Many who knew the transformation formulas thought of the idea of using the fact that the airplane moves in the magnetic field of the earth.
15275,Suppose that an airplane is flying where there is a magnetic field more or less known.
15276,Let’s just take the simple case where the magnetic field is vertical.
15277,"If we hang an insulated wire across the airplane, this electric field will induce charges on the ends of the wire."
15278,That is nothing new.
15279,The transformation equations just say the same thing in a different way.
15280,(The fact that we can say the thing more than one way doesn’t mean that one way is better than another.
15281,"We can’t do it with a voltmeter because the same fields will act on the wires in the voltmeter, but there are ways of measuring such fields."
15282,We talked about some of them when we discussed atmospheric electricity in Chapter 9.
15283,So it should be possible to measure the speed of the airplane.
15284,"This important problem was, however, never solved this way."
15285,The reason is that the electric field that is developed is of the order of millivolts per meter.
15286,"It is possible to measure such fields, but the trouble is that these fields are, unfortunately, not any different from any other electric fields."
15287,"The field that is produced by motion through the magnetic field can’t be distinguished from some electric field that was already in the air from another cause, say from electrostatic charges in the air, or on the clouds."
15288,But they are quite irregular.
15289,It doesn’t do much good to find electric and magnetic fields from Maxwell’s equations unless we know what the fields do when we have them.
15290,"You may remember that the fields are required to find the forces on charges, and that those forces determine the motion of the charge."
15291,"So, of course, part of the theory of electrodynamics is the relation between the motion of charges and the forces."
15292,We would like now to discuss this equation from the point of view of relativity.
15293,"Since we have put our Maxwell equations in relativistic form, it would be interesting to see what the equations of motion would look like in relativistic form."
15294,Let’s see whether we can rewrite the equation in a four-vector notation.
15295,So we might think to replace the left-hand side of Eq.
15296,We would then like to write the right-hand side of Eq.
15297,But this does not make a four-vector.
15298,It is the velocity of the particle—not of a coordinate frame!
15299,"We have to find a variable for our differentiation that is a measure of an “interval” in space-time, which will then be the same in all coordinate systems."
15300,Can we make an invariant interval out of them?
15301,"If we operate on any four-vector with it, we get another four-vector."
15302,(26.28).
15303,It is important to notice that Eq.
15304,(26.34) has in it the relativistic mechanics which are different from Newton’s law for high velocities.
15305,"It is unlike the case of Maxwell’s equations, where we were able to rewrite the equations in the relativistic form without any change in the meaning at all—but with just a change of notation."
15306,Now let’s return to Eq.
15307,(26.24) and see how we can write the right-hand side in four-vector notation.
15308,So everything comes out all right.
15309,"It’s usually more convenient to solve for particle motions by using the original equations (26.24), and that’s what we will usually do."
15310,It is clear that the energy of matter is not conserved.
15311,When an object radiates light it loses energy.
15312,"However, the energy lost is possibly describable in some other form, say in the light."
15313,"Therefore the theory of the conservation of energy is incomplete without a consideration of the energy which is associated with the light or, in general, with the electromagnetic field."
15314,"We take up now the law of conservation of energy and, also, of momentum for the fields."
15315,"Certainly, we cannot treat one without the other, because in the relativity theory they are different aspects of the same four-vector."
15316,"Very early in Volume I, we discussed the conservation of energy; we said then merely that the total energy in the world is constant."
15317,Now we want to extend the idea of the energy conservation law in an important way—in a way that says something in detail about how energy is conserved.
15318,"The new law will say that if energy goes away from a region, it is because it flows away through the boundaries of that region."
15319,It is a somewhat stronger law than the conservation of energy without such a restriction.
15320,"To see what the statement means, let’s look at how the law of the conservation of charge works."
15321,We call that the conservation of charge.
15322,"However, the total charge in the world could be constant in another way."
15323,27–1).
15324,Then the total amount of charge in the world would be conserved.
15325,"Locally, the charge was just “lost.”"
15326,There is a difficulty with such a “world-wide” conservation law in the theory of relativity.
15327,The concept of “simultaneous moments” at distant points is one which is not equivalent in different systems.
15328,Two events that are simultaneous in one system are not simultaneous for another system moving past.
15329,Otherwise there would be some moments when the charge was not conserved.
15330,There seems to be no way to make the law of charge conservation relativistically invariant without making it a “local” conservation law.
15331,"As a matter of fact, the requirement of the Lorentz relativistic invariance seems to restrict the possible laws of nature in surprising ways."
15332,"In modern quantum field theory, for example, people have often wanted to alter the theory by allowing what we call a “nonlocal” interaction—where something here has a direct effect on something there—but we get in trouble with the relativity principle."
15333,“Local” conservation involves another idea.
15334,It says that a charge can get from one place to another only if there is something happening in the space between.
15335,Then the flow is related to the rate of change of the density by Eq.
15336,(27.1).
15337,This is the more extreme kind of a conservation law.
15338,It says that charge is conserved in a special way—conserved “locally.”
15339,It turns out that energy conservation is also a local process.
15340,There is not only an energy density in a given region of space but also a vector to represent the rate of flow of the energy through a surface.
15341,"For example, when a light source radiates, we can find the light energy moving out from the source."
15342,"If we imagine some mathematical surface surrounding the light source, the energy lost from inside the surface is equal to the energy that flows out through the surface."
15343,We want now to write quantitatively the conservation of energy for electromagnetism.
15344,"To do that, we have to describe how much energy there is in any volume element of space, and also the rate of energy flow."
15345,Suppose we think first only of the electromagnetic field energy.
15346,"Then, in perfect analogy with the conservation of charge, Eq."
15347,"Of course, this law is not true in general; it is not true that the field energy is conserved."
15348,Suppose you are in a dark room and then turn on the light switch.
15349,"All of a sudden the room is full of light, so there is energy in the field, although there wasn’t any energy there before."
15350,"Equation (27.2) is not the complete conservation law, because the field energy alone is not conserved, only the total energy in the world—there is also the energy of matter."
15351,The field energy will change if there is some work being done by matter on the field or by the field on matter.
15352,"The total energy of the matter is just the sum of all the particle energies, and the flow of this energy through a surface is just the sum of the energy carried by each particle that crosses the surface."
15353,We want now to talk only about the energy of the electromagnetic field.
15354,"So we must write an equation which says that the total field energy in a given volume decreases either because field energy flows out of the volume or because the field loses energy to matter (or gains energy, which is just a negative loss)."
15355,This is our conservation law for energy in the field.
15356,We can convert it into a differential equation like Eq.
15357,(27.2) if we can change the second term to a volume integral.
15358,That is easy to do with Gauss’ theorem.
15359,So Eq.
15360,"(You won’t, however, need to learn this derivation for our later work.)"
15361,The left-hand side must first be expressed in terms of the fields only.
15362,How can we do that?
15363,"By using Maxwell’s equations, of course."
15364,It’s the same thing we found in electrostatics.
15365,"Now, all we have to do is to make the other term into the divergence of something."
15366,Only that’s wrong!
15367,"The reason it is not is because there is an additional convention from calculus: when a derivative operator is in front of a product, it works on everything to the right."
15368,In Eq.
15369,So it’s not the same thing.
15370,It’s like what happens when we take a derivative of a product in algebra.
15371,The trick is to throw out—for a while at least—the rule of the calculus notation about what the derivative operator works on.
15372,"You see, ordinarily, the order of terms is used for two separate purposes."
15373,"We can, if we want, choose to abandon momentarily the calculus rule."
15374,"Instead of saying that a derivative operates on everything to the right, we make a new rule that doesn’t depend on the order in which terms are written down."
15375,Then we can juggle terms around without worrying.
15376,"Here is our new convention: we show, by a subscript, what a differential operator works on; the order has no meaning."
15377,(It’s surprising that such a handy notation is never taught in books on mathematics or physics.)
15378,I want the derivative of both terms.
15379,"(Of course, when we are finished, we will want to return to the “standard” notation that everybody usually uses.)"
15380,So now we can do the various things like interchanging dots and crosses and making other kinds of rearrangements of the terms.
15381,"For instance, the middle term of Eq."
15382,"It looks freakish, but it is all right."
15383,"The first one is already that way, so we can just leave off the subscript."
15384,"You probably won’t see it anywhere else, and it is very good for unlocking vector algebra from the rules about the order of terms with derivatives.)"
15385,"We now return to our energy conservation discussion and use our new result, Eq."
15386,(27.7).
15387,"So we almost made it, but not quite."
15388,Our program was successful.
15389,"We have an expression for the energy density that is the sum of an “electric” energy density and a “magnetic” energy density, whose forms are just like the ones we found in statics when we worked out the energy in terms of the fields."
15390,"Also, we have found a formula for the energy flow vector of the electromagnetic field."
15391,It tells us the rate at which the field energy moves around in space.
15392,Before we take up some applications of the Poynting formulas [Eqs.
15393,"(27.14) and (27.15)], we would like to say that we have not really “proved” them."
15394,(27.6).
15395,It’s possible.
15396,"It can be done, but the forms that have been found always involve various derivatives of the field (and always with second-order terms like a second derivative or the square of a first derivative)."
15397,"People have guessed that the simplest one is probably the correct one, but we must say that we do not know for certain what is the actual location in space of the electromagnetic field energy."
15398,So we too will take the easy way out and say that the field energy is given by Eq.
15399,(27.14).
15400,(27.15).
15401,It is interesting that there seems to be no unique way to resolve the indefiniteness in the location of the field energy.
15402,It is sometimes claimed that this problem can be resolved by using the theory of gravitation in the following argument.
15403,"In the theory of gravity, all energy is the source of gravitational attraction."
15404,Therefore the energy density of electricity must be located properly if we are to know in which direction the gravity force acts.
15405,"As yet, however, no one has done such a delicate experiment that the precise location of the gravitational influence of electromagnetic fields could be determined."
15406,That electromagnetic fields alone can be the source of gravitational force is an idea it is hard to do without.
15407,"It has, in fact, been observed that light is deflected as it passes near the sun—we could say that the sun pulls the light down toward it."
15408,Do you not want to allow that the light pulls equally on the sun?
15409,"Anyway, everyone always accepts the simple expressions we have found for the location of electromagnetic energy and its flow."
15410,"And although sometimes the results obtained from using them seem strange, nobody has ever found anything wrong with them—that is, no disagreement with experiment."
15411,"So we will follow the rest of the world—besides, we believe that it is probably perfectly right."
15412,We should make one further remark about the energy formula.
15413,We found two such expressions as possible expressions for the energy when we were doing static problems.
15414,"However, in an electrodynamic field the equality failed, and there was no obvious choice as to which was the right one."
15415,Now we know which is the right one.
15416,"Similarly, we have found the formula for the magnetic energy that is correct in general."
15417,The right formula for the energy density of dynamic fields is Eq.
15418,(27.14).
15419,We want now to see how it works in some special cases and also to see whether it checks out with anything that we knew before.
15420,The first example we will take is light.
15421,(See Fig.
15422,27–2.)
15423,"Believe it or not, we have already derived this result in Section 31–5 of Vol."
15424,"I, when we were studying light."
15425,We can believe that it is right because it also checks against something else.
15426,"When we have a light beam, there is an energy density in space given by Eq."
15427,(27.14).
15428,(27.17).
15429,Now we take another example.
15430,Here is a rather curious one.
15431,We look at the energy flow in a capacitor that we are charging slowly.
15432,"(We don’t want frequencies so high that the capacitor is beginning to look like a resonant cavity, but we don’t want dc either.)"
15433,"Suppose we use a circular parallel plate capacitor of our usual kind, as shown in Fig."
15434,27–3.
15435,There is a nearly uniform electric field inside which is changing with time.
15436,Of course you know that it must come in on the charging wires—not at all!
15437,"You remember, of course, that there is a magnetic field that circles around the axis when the capacitor is charging."
15438,We discussed that in Chapter 23.
15439,27–3.
15440,"The energy isn’t actually coming down the wires, but from the space surrounding the capacitor."
15441,Let’s check whether or not the total amount of flow through the whole surface between the edges of the plates checks with the rate of change of the energy inside—it had better; we went through all that work proving Eq.
15442,"(27.15) to make sure, but let’s see."
15443,(27.20).
15444,"But it tells us a peculiar thing: that when we are charging a capacitor, the energy is not coming down the wires; it is coming in through the edges of the gap."
15445,That’s what this theory says!
15446,How can that be?
15447,"That’s not an easy question, but here is one way of thinking about it."
15448,Suppose that we had some charges above and below the capacitor and far away.
15449,"When the charges are far away, there is a weak but enormously spread-out field that surrounds the capacitor."
15450,(See Fig.
15451,27–4.)
15452,"Then, as the charges come together, the field gets stronger nearer to the capacitor."
15453,So the field energy which is way out moves toward the capacitor and eventually ends up between the plates.
15454,"As another example, we ask what happens in a piece of resistance wire when it is carrying a current."
15455,"Since the wire has resistance, there is an electric field along it, driving the current."
15456,"Because there is a potential drop along the wire, there is also an electric field just outside the wire, parallel to the surface."
15457,(See Fig.
15458,27–5.)
15459,"There is, in addition, a magnetic field which goes around the wire because of the current."
15460,There is a flow of energy into the wire all around.
15461,"It is, of course, equal to the energy being lost in the wire in the form of heat."
15462,So our “crazy” theory says that the electrons are getting their energy to generate heat because of the energy flowing into the wire from the field outside.
15463,"Intuition would seem to tell us that the electrons get their energy from being pushed along the wire, so the energy should be flowing down (or up) along the wire."
15464,"But the theory says that the electrons are really being pushed by an electric field, which has come from some charges very far away, and that the electrons get their energy for generating heat from these fields."
15465,The energy somehow flows from the distant charges into a wide area of space and then inward to the wire.
15466,"Finally, in order to really convince you that this theory is obviously nuts, we will take one more example—an example in which an electric charge and a magnet are at rest near each other—both sitting quite still."
15467,"Suppose we take the example of a point charge sitting near the center of a bar magnet, as shown in Fig."
15468,27–6.
15469,"Everything is at rest, so the energy is not changing with time."
15470,"If you look at the energy flow, you find that it just circulates around and around."
15471,There isn’t any change in the energy anywhere—everything which flows into one volume flows out again.
15472,It is like incompressible water flowing around.
15473,So there is a circulation of energy in this so-called static condition.
15474,How absurd it gets!
15475,"Perhaps it isn’t so terribly puzzling, though, when you remember that what we called a “static” magnet is really a circulating permanent current."
15476,In a permanent magnet the electrons are spinning permanently inside.
15477,So maybe a circulation of the energy outside isn’t so queer after all.
15478,You no doubt begin to get the impression that the Poynting theory at least partially violates your intuition as to where energy is located in an electromagnetic field.
15479,"You might believe that you must revamp all your intuitions, and, therefore have a lot of things to study here."
15480,But it seems really not necessary.
15481,"You don’t need to feel that you will be in great trouble if you forget once in a while that the energy in a wire is flowing into the wire from the outside, rather than along the wire."
15482,"It seems to be only rarely of value, when using the idea of energy conservation, to notice in detail what path the energy is taking."
15483,"The circulation of energy around a magnet and a charge seems, in most circumstances, to be quite unimportant."
15484,"It is not a vital detail, but it is clear that our ordinary intuitions are quite wrong."
15485,Next we would like to talk about the momentum in the electromagnetic field.
15486,"Just as the field has energy, it will have a certain momentum per unit volume."
15487,The rate-of-change of the momentum of matter is just the force on it.
15488,"The “momentum outflow” term, however, is strange."
15489,"It’s a lot of work, and we are not going to do it."
15490,"The same result would come out of the other analysis we suggested, but it is more interesting to notice this more general result."
15491,We will now give a number of interesting examples and arguments to convince you that the general theorem is true.
15492,So the theorem is true for a bunch of particles.
15493,It is also true for light.
15494,"When we studied light in Volume I, we saw that when the energy is absorbed from a light beam, a certain amount of momentum is delivered to the absorber."
15495,"We have, in fact, shown in Chapter 34 of Vol."
15496,(34.24) of Vol.
15497,I].
15498,So again the theorem is right.
15499,Finally we will give an argument due to Einstein which demonstrates the same thing once more.
15500,"At one end there is a device which will shoot out some particles or light (or anything, it doesn’t make any difference what it is), which are then stopped at the opposite end of the car."
15501,"27–7(a)—and then later it is at the opposite end, as shown in Fig."
15502,27–7(c).
15503,"Einstein didn’t like the idea that the center of gravity of an object could be moved by fooling around only on the inside, so he assumed that it is impossible to move the center of gravity by doing anything inside."
15504,Let’s now look at the special case of the energy being carried by a light flash.
15505,"(The argument would work as well for particles, but we will follow Einstein, who was interested in the problem of light.)"
15506,What causes the car to be moved?
15507,It is this recoil which makes the car roll backward.
15508,"Then, when it hits, it gives back its momentum and stops the car."
15509,You may well wonder: What is so important about the center-of-gravity theorem?
15510,Maybe it is wrong.
15511,"Perhaps, but then we would also lose the conservation of angular momentum."
15512,27–8.
15513,It turns out that the angular momentum conservation and the theorem of center-of-gravity are closely related in the relativity theory.
15514,So the conservation of angular momentum would also be destroyed if our theorem were not true.
15515,"At any rate, it does turn out to be a true general law, and in the case of electrodynamics we can use it to get the momentum in the field."
15516,We will mention two further examples of momentum in the electromagnetic field.
15517,We pointed out in Section 26–2 the failure of the law of action and reaction when two charged particles were moving on orthogonal trajectories.
15518,"The forces on the two particles don’t balance out, so the action and reaction are not equal; therefore the net momentum of the matter must be changing."
15519,It is not conserved.
15520,But the momentum in the field is also changing in such a situation.
15521,"If you work out the amount of momentum given by the Poynting vector, it is not constant."
15522,"However, the change of the particle momenta is just made up by the field momentum, so the total momentum of particles plus field is conserved."
15523,"Finally, another example is the situation with the magnet and the charge, shown in Fig."
15524,27–6.
15525,"We were unhappy to find that energy was flowing around in circles, but now, since we know that energy flow and momentum are proportional, we know also that there is momentum circulating in the space."
15526,But a circulating momentum means that there is angular momentum.
15527,So there is angular momentum in the field.
15528,Do you remember the paradox we described in Section 17–4 about a solenoid and some charges mounted on a disc?
15529,"It seemed that when the current turned off, the whole disc should start to turn."
15530,The puzzle was: Where did the angular momentum come from?
15531,"The answer is that if you have a magnetic field and some charges, there will be some angular momentum in the field."
15532,It must have been put there when the field was built up.
15533,"When the field is turned off, the angular momentum is given back."
15534,So the disc in the paradox would start rotating.
15535,"This mystic circulating flow of energy, which at first seemed so ridiculous, is absolutely necessary."
15536,There is really a momentum flow.
15537,It is needed to maintain the conservation of angular momentum in the whole world.
15538,"In bringing together relativity and Maxwell’s equations, we have finished our main work on the theory of electromagnetism."
15539,"There are, of course, some details we have skipped over and one large area that we will be concerned with in the future—the interaction of electromagnetic fields with matter."
15540,"But we want to stop for a moment to show you that this tremendous edifice, which is such a beautiful success in explaining so many phenomena, ultimately falls on its face."
15541,"When you follow any of our physics too far, you find that it always gets into some kind of trouble."
15542,Now we want to discuss a serious trouble—the failure of the classical electromagnetic theory.
15543,You can appreciate that there is a failure of all classical physics because of the quantum-mechanical effects.
15544,Classical mechanics is a mathematically consistent theory; it just doesn’t agree with experience.
15545,"It is interesting, though, that the classical theory of electromagnetism is an unsatisfactory theory all by itself."
15546,There are difficulties associated with the ideas of Maxwell’s theory which are not solved by and not directly associated with quantum mechanics.
15547,"You may say, “Perhaps there’s no use worrying about these difficulties."
15548,"Since the quantum mechanics is going to change the laws of electrodynamics, we should wait to see what difficulties there are after the modification.” However, when electromagnetism is joined to quantum mechanics, the difficulties remain."
15549,So it will not be a waste of our time now to look at what these difficulties are.
15550,"Also, they are of great historical importance."
15551,"Furthermore, you may get some feeling of accomplishment from being able to go far enough with the theory to see everything—including all of its troubles."
15552,"The difficulty we speak of is associated with the concepts of electromagnetic momentum and energy, when applied to the electron or any charged particle."
15553,The concepts of simple charged particles and the electromagnetic field are in some way inconsistent.
15554,"To describe the difficulty, we begin by doing some exercises with our energy and momentum concepts."
15555,"First, we compute the energy of a charged particle."
15556,Now let’s calculate the energy in the electromagnetic field.
15557,"If the charge is standing still, there is no magnetic field, and the energy per unit volume is proportional to the square of the electric field."
15558,"Because the energy of the field varies inversely as the fourth power of the distance from the center, its volume integral is infinite."
15559,There is an infinite amount of energy in the field surrounding a point charge.
15560,What’s wrong with an infinite energy?
15561,"If the energy can’t get out, but must stay there forever, is there any real difficulty with an infinite energy?"
15562,"Of course, a quantity that comes out infinite may be annoying, but what really matters is only whether there are any observable physical effects."
15563,"To answer that question, we must turn to something else besides the energy."
15564,Suppose we ask how the energy changes when we move the charge.
15565,"Then, if the changes are infinite, we will be in trouble."
15566,"Suppose an electron is moving at a uniform velocity through space, assuming for a moment that the velocity is low compared with the speed of light."
15567,Associated with this moving electron there is a momentum—even if the electron had no mass before it was charged—because of the momentum in the electromagnetic field.
15568,"The momentum density, Eq."
15569,28–2.
15570,Where does the mass come from?
15571,In our laws of mechanics we have supposed that every object “carries” a thing we call the mass—which also means that it “carries” a momentum proportional to its velocity.
15572,Now we discover that it is understandable that a charged particle carries a momentum proportional to its velocity.
15573,"It might, in fact, be that the mass is just the effect of electrodynamics."
15574,The origin of mass has until now been unexplained.
15575,We have at last in the theory of electrodynamics a grand opportunity to understand something that we never understood before.
15576,"It comes out of the blue—or rather, from Maxwell and Poynting—that any charged particle will have a momentum proportional to its velocity just from electromagnetic influences."
15577,"Let’s be conservative and say, for a moment, that there are two kinds of mass—that the total momentum of an object could be the sum of a mechanical momentum and the electromagnetic momentum."
15578,"In experiments where we measure the mass of a particle by seeing how much momentum it has, or how it swings around in an orbit, we are measuring the total mass."
15579,So the observed mass can consist of two pieces (or possibly more if we include other fields): a mechanical piece plus an electromagnetic piece.
15580,"We know that there is definitely an electromagnetic piece, and we have a formula for it."
15581,And there is the thrilling possibility that the mechanical piece is not there at all—that the mass is all electromagnetic.
15582,Let’s see what size the electron must have if there is to be no mechanical mass.
15583,We can find out by setting the electromagnetic mass of Eq.
15584,Because we could equally well do the same calculation with other assumed distributions of charges—the charge might be spread uniformly through the volume of a sphere or it might be smeared out like a fuzzy ball.
15585,Then different theories could supply their pet coefficients.
15586,Let’s pursue our electromagnetic theory of mass.
15587,"Early attempts led to a certain amount of confusion, but Lorentz realized that the charged sphere would contract into a ellipsoid at high velocities and that the fields would change in accordance with the formulas (26.6) and (26.7) we derived for the relativistic case in Chapter 26."
15588,Early experiments were proposed to measure the changes with velocity in the observed mass of a particle in order to determine how much of the mass was mechanical and how much was electrical.
15589,"It was believed at the time that the electrical part would vary with velocity, whereas the mechanical part would not."
15590,"But while the experiments were being done, the theorists were also at work."
15591,Equation (28.7) was the beginning of the theory that mass depended on velocity.
15592,"Let’s now go back to our calculation of the energy in the field, which led to Eq."
15593,(28.2).
15594,(28.4).
15595,"In fact, if we just combine Eqs."
15596,"The discrepancy between the two formulas for the electromagnetic mass is especially annoying, because we have carefully proved that the theory of electrodynamics is consistent with the principle of relativity."
15597,So we are in some kind of trouble; we must have made a mistake.
15598,"We did not make an algebraic mistake in our calculations, but we have left something out."
15599,"In deriving our equations for energy and momentum, we assumed the conservation laws."
15600,We assumed that all forces were taken into account and that any work done and any momentum carried by other “nonelectrical” machinery was included.
15601,"Now if we have a sphere of charge, the electrical forces are all repulsive and an electron would tend to fly apart."
15602,"Because the system has unbalanced forces, we can get all kinds of errors in the laws relating energy and momentum."
15603,"To get a consistent picture, we must imagine that something holds the electron together."
15604,The charges must be held to the sphere by some kind of rubber bands—something that keeps the charges from flying off.
15605,It was first pointed out by Poincaré that the rubber bands—or whatever it is that holds the electron together—must be included in the energy and momentum calculations.
15606,"For this reason the extra nonelectrical forces are also known by the more elegant name “the Poincaré stresses.” If the extra forces are included in the calculations, the masses obtained in two ways are changed (in a way that depends on the detailed assumptions)."
15607,"And the results are consistent with relativity; i.e., the mass that comes out from the momentum calculation is the same as the one that comes from the energy calculation."
15608,"However, both of them contain two contributions: an electromagnetic mass and contribution from the Poincaré stresses."
15609,Only when the two are added together do we get a consistent theory.
15610,It is therefore impossible to get all the mass to be electromagnetic in the way we hoped.
15611,It is not a legal theory if we have nothing but electrodynamics.
15612,Something else has to be added.
15613,"Whatever you call them—“rubber bands,” or “Poincaré stresses,” or something else—there have to be other forces in nature to make a consistent theory of this kind."
15614,"Clearly, as soon as we have to put forces on the inside of the electron, the beauty of the whole idea begins to disappear."
15615,Things get very complicated.
15616,You would want to ask: How strong are the stresses?
15617,How does the electron shake?
15618,Does it oscillate?
15619,What are all its internal properties?
15620,And so on.
15621,It might be possible that an electron does have some complicated internal properties.
15622,"If we made a theory of the electron along these lines, it would predict odd properties, like modes of oscillation, which haven’t apparently been observed."
15623,We say “apparently” because we observe a lot of things in nature that still do not make sense.
15624,"We may someday find out that one of the things we don’t understand today (for example, the muon) can, in fact, be explained as an oscillation of the Poincaré stresses."
15625,"It doesn’t seem likely, but no one can say for sure."
15626,There are so many things about fundamental particles that we still don’t understand.
15627,"Anyway, the complex structure implied by this theory is undesirable, and the attempt to explain all mass in terms of electromagnetism—at least in the way we have described—has led to a blind alley."
15628,We would like to think a little more about why we say we have a mass when the momentum in the field is proportional to the velocity.
15629,Easy!
15630,The mass is the coefficient between momentum and velocity.
15631,But we can look at the mass in another way: a particle has mass if you have to exert a force in order to accelerate it.
15632,So it may help our understanding if we look a little more closely at where the forces come from.
15633,How do we know that there has to be a force?
15634,Because we have proved the law of the conservation of momentum for the fields.
15635,"If we have a charged particle and push on it for awhile, there will be some momentum in the electromagnetic field."
15636,Momentum must have been poured into the field somehow.
15637,"Therefore there must have been a force pushing on the electron in order to get it going—a force in addition to that required by its mechanical inertia, a force due to its electromagnetic interaction."
15638,And there must be a corresponding force back on the “pusher.” But where does that force come from?
15639,The picture is something like this.
15640,We can think of the electron as a charged sphere.
15641,"When it is at rest, each piece of charge repels electrically each other piece, but the forces all balance in pairs, so that there is no net force."
15642,[See Fig.
15643,28–3(a).]
15644,"However, when the electron is being accelerated, the forces will no longer be in balance because of the fact that the electromagnetic influences take time to go from one piece to another."
15645,Both the magnitude and direction of the force depend on the motion of the charge.
15646,"If the charge is accelerating, the forces on various parts of the electron might be as shown in Fig."
15647,28–3(c).
15648,"When all these forces are added up, they don’t cancel out."
15649,"They would cancel for a uniform velocity, even though it looks at first glance as though the retardation would give an unbalanced force even for a uniform velocity."
15650,But it turns out that there is no net force unless the electron is being accelerated.
15651,"With acceleration, if we look at the forces between the various parts of the electron, action and reaction are not exactly equal, and the electron exerts a force on itself that tries to hold back the acceleration."
15652,It holds itself back by its own bootstraps.
15653,"It is possible, but difficult, to calculate this self-reaction force; however, we don’t want to go into such an elaborate calculation here."
15654,"Then, the self-force can be written in a series."
15655,(28.4) would be changed in the same way.
15656,"And we can see that the infinity arises because of the force of one part of the electron on another—because we have allowed what is perhaps a silly thing, the possibility of the “point” electron acting on itself."
15657,We would like now to discuss how it might be possible to modify Maxwell’s theory of electrodynamics so that the idea of an electron as a simple point charge could be maintained.
15658,"Many attempts have been made, and some of the theories were even able to arrange things so that all the electron mass was electromagnetic."
15659,But all of these theories have died.
15660,It is still interesting to discuss some of the possibilities that have been suggested—to see the struggles of the human mind.
15661,We started out our theory of electricity by talking about the interaction of one charge with another.
15662,Then we made up a theory of these interacting charges and ended up with a field theory.
15663,We believe it so much that we allow it to tell us about the force of one part of an electron on another.
15664,Perhaps the entire difficulty is that electrons do not act on themselves; perhaps we are making too great an extrapolation from the interaction of separate electrons to the idea that an electron interacts with itself.
15665,Therefore some theories have been proposed in which the possibility that an electron acts on itself is ruled out.
15666,Then there is no longer the infinity due to the self-action.
15667,"Also, there is no longer any electromagnetic mass associated with the particle; all the mass is back to being mechanical, but there are new difficulties in the theory."
15668,We must say immediately that such theories require a modification of the idea of the electromagnetic field.
15669,"This makes the theory much more elaborate, but it gets rid of the difficulty of the infinity."
15670,"So we can, if we want to, say that there is no such thing as the electron acting upon itself, and throw away the whole set of forces in Eq."
15671,(28.9).
15672,"However, we have then thrown away the baby with the bath!"
15673,Because the second term in Eq.
15674,That force does something very definite.
15675,"If you throw it away, you’re in trouble again."
15676,"When we accelerate a charge, it radiates electromagnetic waves, so it loses energy."
15677,"Therefore, to accelerate a charge, we must require more force than is required to accelerate a neutral object of the same mass; otherwise energy wouldn’t be conserved."
15678,The rate at which we do work on an accelerating charge must be equal to the rate of loss of energy by radiation.
15679,We have talked about this effect before—it is called the radiation resistance.
15680,"We still have to answer the question: Where does the extra force, against which we must do this work, come from?"
15681,"When a big antenna is radiating, the forces come from the influence of one part of the antenna current on another."
15682,"For a single accelerating electron radiating into otherwise empty space, there would seem to be only one place the force could come from—the action of one part of the electron on another part."
15683,We found back in Chapter 32 of Vol.
15684,(28.9).
15685,The second term should correspond to the radiated power in Eq.
15686,(28.10).
15687,But it is different.
15688,The discrepancy comes from the fact that the term in Eq.
15689,"(28.11) is generally true, whereas Eq."
15690,(28.10) is right only for an oscillating charge.
15691,We can show that the two are equivalent if the motion of the charge is periodic.
15692,"To do that, we rewrite the second term of Eq."
15693,"The second term, however, is always positive (it’s a square), so its average is also positive."
15694,This term gives the net work done and is just equal to Eq.
15695,(28.10).
15696,"It was, in fact, one of the triumphs of Lorentz to show that there is such a force and that it comes from the action of the electron on itself."
15697,The problem is how we can get that term without getting the first term in Eq.
15698,"(28.9), which gives all the trouble."
15699,We don’t know how.
15700,You see that the classical electron theory has pushed itself into a tight corner.
15701,There have been several other attempts to modify the laws in order to straighten the thing out.
15702,"One way, proposed by Born and Infeld, is to change the Maxwell equations in a complicated way so that they are no longer linear."
15703,Then the electromagnetic energy and momentum can be made to come out finite.
15704,But the laws they suggest predict phenomena which have never been observed.
15705,"Their theory also suffers from another difficulty we will come to later, which is common to all the attempts to avoid the troubles we have described."
15706,The following peculiar possibility was suggested by Dirac.
15707,He said: Let’s admit that an electron acts on itself through the second term in Eq.
15708,(28.9) but not through the first.
15709,He then had an ingenious idea for getting rid of one but not the other.
15710,"Look, he said, we made a special assumption when we took only the retarded wave solutions of Maxwell’s equations; if we were to take the advanced waves instead, we would get something different."
15711,(28.9) except for the sign of the second term—and some higher terms—of the series.
15712,The only effect on Eq.
15713,(28.9) is to change the sign of all the odd time derivatives.]
15714,"So, Dirac said, let’s make the new rule that an electron acts on itself by one-half the difference of the retarded and advanced fields which it produces."
15715,The difference of Eqs.
15716,"Therefore, when we go to the limit of a point charge, we get only the one term—just what is needed."
15717,"In this way, Dirac got the radiation resistance force and none of the inertial forces."
15718,"There is no electromagnetic mass, and the classical theory is saved—but at the expense of an arbitrary assumption about the self-force."
15719,"The arbitrariness of the extra assumption of Dirac was removed, to some extent at least, by Wheeler and Feynman, who proposed a still stranger theory."
15720,"They suggest that point charges interact only with other charges, but that the interaction is half through the advanced and half through the retarded waves."
15721,"It turns out, most surprisingly, that in most situations you won’t see any effects of the advanced waves, but they do have the effect of producing just the radiation reaction force."
15722,"The radiation resistance is not due to the electron acting on itself, but from the following peculiar effect."
15723,"(They also react back with their retarded waves too, but that just corresponds to the normal “reflected” waves.)"
15724,The combination of the advanced and retarded waves means that at the instant it is accelerated an oscillating charge feels a force from all the charges that are “going to” absorb its radiated waves.
15725,You see what tight knots people have gotten into in trying to get a theory of the electron!
15726,"We’ll describe now still another kind of theory, to show the kind of things that people think of when they are stuck."
15727,"This is another modification of the laws of electrodynamics, proposed by Bopp."
15728,You realize that once you decide to change the equations of electromagnetism you can start anywhere you want.
15729,"You can change the force law for an electron, or you can change the Maxwell equations (as we saw in the examples we have described), or you can make a change somewhere else."
15730,One possibility is to change the formulas that give the potentials in terms of the charges and currents.
15731,One of our formulas has been that the potentials at some point are given by the current density (or charge) at each other point at an earlier time.
15732,"No differential equation, nothing else."
15733,"Well, one more thing."
15734,We also ask that the result should be relativistically invariant.
15735,So by “distance” we should take the invariant “distance” between two points in space-time.
15736,28–4.
15737,Then Eq.
15738,(28.16) says that charges contribute to the integral of Eq.
15739,What is the significance?
15740,"In other words, this theory of Bopp approaches the Maxwell theory—so long as we are far away from any particular charge—in the sense that it gives the retarded wave effects."
15741,"We can, in fact, see approximately what the integral of Eq."
15742,(28.15) is going to give.
15743,"And it all came out of the simple proposition that the potential at one point in space-time depends on the current density at all other points in space-time, but with a weighting factor that is some narrow function of the four-dimensional distance between the two points."
15744,"This theory again predicts a finite electromagnetic mass for the electron, and the energy and mass have the right relation for the relativity theory."
15745,"They must, because the theory is relativistically invariant from the start, and everything seems to be all right."
15746,"There is, however, one fundamental objection to this theory and to all the other theories we have described."
15747,"All particles we know obey the laws of quantum mechanics, so a quantum-mechanical modification of electrodynamics has to be made."
15748,Light behaves like photons.
15749,So the electrodynamic theory has to be changed.
15750,"We have already mentioned that it might be a waste of time to work so hard to straighten out the classical theory, because it could turn out that in quantum electrodynamics the difficulties will disappear or may be resolved in some other fashion."
15751,But the difficulties do not disappear in quantum electrodynamics.
15752,"That is one of the reasons that people have spent so much effort trying to straighten out the classical difficulties, hoping that if they could straighten out the classical difficulty and then make the quantum modifications, everything would be straightened out."
15753,The Maxwell theory still has the difficulties after the quantum mechanics modifications are made.
15754,And the answers depend on how you stop the integrals.
15755,"We cannot, unfortunately, demonstrate for you here that the difficulties are really basically the same, because we have developed so little of the theory of quantum mechanics and even less of quantum electrodynamics."
15756,So you must just take our word that the quantized theory of Maxwell’s electrodynamics gives an infinite mass for a point electron.
15757,"It turns out, however, that nobody has ever succeeded in making a self-consistent quantum theory out of any of the modified theories."
15758,Born and Infeld’s ideas have never been satisfactorily made into a quantum theory.
15759,"The theories with the advanced and retarded waves of Dirac, or of Wheeler and Feynman, have never been made into a satisfactory quantum theory."
15760,The theory of Bopp has never been made into a satisfactory quantum theory.
15761,"So today, there is no known solution to this problem."
15762,"We do not know how to make a consistent theory—including the quantum mechanics—which does not produce an infinity for the self-energy of an electron, or any point charge."
15763,"And at the same time, there is no satisfactory theory that describes a non-point charge."
15764,It’s an unsolved problem.
15765,"In case you are deciding to rush off to make a theory in which the action of an electron on itself is completely removed, so that electromagnetic mass is no longer meaningful, and then to make a quantum theory of it, you should be warned that you are certain to be in trouble."
15766,There is definite experimental evidence of the existence of electromagnetic inertia—there is evidence that some of the mass of charged particles is electromagnetic in origin.
15767,"It used to be said in the older books that since Nature will obviously not present us with two particles—one neutral and the other charged, but otherwise the same—we will never be able to tell how much of the mass is electromagnetic and how much is mechanical."
15768,"But it turns out that Nature has been kind enough to present us with just such objects, so that by comparing the observed mass of the charged one with the observed mass of the neutral one, we can tell whether there is any electromagnetic mass."
15769,"For example, there are the neutrons and protons."
15770,They interact with tremendous forces—the nuclear forces—whose origin is unknown.
15771,"However, as we have already described, the nuclear forces have one remarkable property."
15772,"So far as they are concerned, the neutron and proton are exactly the same."
15773,"The nuclear forces between neutron and neutron, neutron and proton, and proton and proton are all identical as far as we can tell."
15774,Only the little electromagnetic forces are different; electrically the proton and neutron are as different as night and day.
15775,This is just what we wanted.
15776,"There are two particles, identical from the point of view of the strong interactions, but different electrically."
15777,And they have a small difference in mass.
15778,The only trouble is that the sign is wrong!
15779,The neutron is heavier than the proton.
15780,Nature has also given us several other pairs—or triplets—of particles which appear to be exactly the same except for their electrical charge.
15781,"They interact with protons and neutrons, through the so-called “strong” interactions of the nuclear forces."
15782,"In Table 28–1 we give a list of such particles, together with their measured masses."
15783,You will see from the table that the mass differences of the other particles are usually of the same general size.
15784,"Now the size of these particles can be determined by other methods, for instance by the diameters they appear to have in high-energy collisions."
15785,"So the electromagnetic mass seems to be in general agreement with electromagnetic theory, if we stop our integrals of the field energy at the same radius obtained by these other methods."
15786,That’s why we believe that the differences do represent electromagnetic mass.
15787,You are no doubt worried about the different signs of the mass differences in the table.
15788,It is easy to see why the charged ones should be heavier than the neutral ones.
15789,"But what about those pairs like the proton and the neutron, where the measured mass comes out the other way?"
15790,"Well, it turns out that these particles are complicated, and the computation of the electromagnetic mass must be more elaborate for them."
15791,"For instance, although the neutron has no net charge, it does have a charge distribution inside it—it is only the net charge that is zero."
15792,28–5.
15793,"Although the neutron is “neutral,” because its total charge is zero, there are still electromagnetic energies (for example, it has a magnetic moment), so it’s not easy to tell the sign of the electromagnetic mass difference without a detailed theory of the internal structure."
15794,"We only wish to emphasize here the following points: (1) the electromagnetic theory predicts the existence of an electromagnetic mass, but it also falls on its face in doing so, because it does not produce a consistent theory—and the same is true with the quantum modifications; (2) there is experimental evidence for the existence of electromagnetic mass; and (3) all these masses are roughly the same as the mass of an electron."
15795,Is it or isn’t it?
15796,"We haven’t got a theory, so we cannot say."
15797,"We must mention one more piece of information, which is the most annoying."
15798,"There is another particle in the world called a muon which, so far as we can tell, differs in no way whatsoever from an electron except for its mass."
15799,"It acts in every way like an electron: it interacts with neutrinos and with the electromagnetic field, and it has no nuclear forces."
15800,"Therefore, whenever someone finally gets the explanation of the mass of an electron, he will then have the puzzle of where a muon gets its mass."
15801,Why?
15802,"Because whatever the electron does, the muon does the same—so the mass ought to come out the same."
15803,"There are those who believe faithfully in the idea that the muon and the electron are the same particle and that, in the final theory of the mass, the formula for the mass will be a quadratic equation with two roots—one for each particle."
15804,"There are also those who propose it will be a transcendental equation with an infinite number of roots, and who are engaged in guessing what the masses of the other particles in the series must be, and why these particles haven’t been discovered yet."
15805,We would like to make some further remarks about the part of the mass of nuclear particles that is not electromagnetic.
15806,Where does this other large fraction come from?
15807,"There are other forces besides electrodynamics—like nuclear forces—that have their own field theories, although no one knows whether the current theories are right."
15808,But the meson field theories are still in a most rudimentary state.
15809,"Even with the well-developed theory of electromagnetism, we found it impossible to get beyond first base in explaining the electron mass."
15810,"With the theory of the mesons, we strike out."
15811,"We may take a moment to outline the theory of the mesons, because of its interesting connection with electrodynamics."
15812,"(Because of the weakness of the human brain, we can’t think of something really new; so we argue by analogy with what we know.)"
15813,"But we know that nuclear forces have much shorter distances of action, so the simple equation won’t work."
15814,Let’s see what Eq.
15815,(28.17) gives for the nuclear force when things are not changing with time.
15816,28–6.
15817,The “range” of nuclear forces is much less than the “range” of electrostatic forces.
15818,"Finally, let’s look at the free-wave solution of Eq."
15819,(28.17).
15820,But now we have pushed the ideas of electrodynamics into regions where they may not really be valid—we have gone beyond electrodynamics to the problem of the nuclear forces.
15821,We want now to describe—mainly in a qualitative way—the motions of charges in various circumstances.
15822,"Most of the interesting phenomena in which charges are moving in fields occur in very complicated situations, with many, many charges all interacting with each other."
15823,"For instance, when an electromagnetic wave goes through a block of material or a plasma, billions and billions of charges are interacting with the wave and with each other."
15824,"We will come to such problems later, but now we just want to discuss the much simpler problem of the motions of a single charge in a given field."
15825,"We can then disregard all other charges—except, of course, those charges and currents which exist somewhere to produce the fields we will assume."
15826,We should probably ask first about the motion of a particle in a uniform electric field.
15827,"At low velocities, the motion is not particularly interesting—it is just a uniform acceleration in the direction of the field."
15828,"However, if the particle picks up enough energy to become relativistic, then the motion gets more complicated."
15829,But we will leave the solution for that case for you to play with.
15830,"Next, we consider the motion in a uniform magnetic field with zero electric field."
15831,We have already solved this problem—one solution is that the particle goes in a circle.
15832,That is only one possibility.
15833,"If the particle has a component of its motion along the field direction, that motion is constant, since there can be no component of the magnetic force in the direction of the field."
15834,29–1).
15835,The radius of the helix is given by Eq.
15836,"A uniform magnetic field is often used in making a “momentum analyzer,” or “momentum spectrometer,” for high-energy charged particles."
15837,"29–2(a), the magnetic field being perpendicular to the plane of the drawing."
15838,Each particle will go into an orbit which is a circle whose radius is proportional to its momentum.
15839,It is not necessary that all the particles enter at right angles to the field edge.
15840,"Figure 29–2(b) shows the trajectories of three particles, all with the same momentum but entering the field at different angles."
15841,"A larger angular acceptance usually means that more particles are counted in a given time, decreasing the time required for a given measurement."
15842,"There are many other forms of momentum spectrometers, but we will describe just one more, which has an especially large solid angle of acceptance."
15843,"It is based on the helical orbits in a uniform field, like the one shown in Fig."
15844,29–1.
15845,29–3.
15846,(Remember that this is just a kind of projection of a helical trajectory.)
15847,So the apparatus selects a small interval of momenta.
15848,A large fraction of the particles from the source are used—an important advantage for weak sources or for very precise measurements.
15849,"One pays a price for this advantage, however, because a large volume of uniform magnetic field is required, and this is usually only practical for low-energy particles."
15850,"One way of making a uniform field, you remember, is to wind a coil on a sphere, with a surface current density proportional to the sine of the angle."
15851,You can also show that the same thing is true for an ellipsoid of rotation.
15852,So such spectrometers are often made by winding an elliptical coil on a wooden (or aluminum) frame.
15853,29–4.
15854,Particle focusing has many applications.
15855,"For instance, the electrons that leave the cathode in a TV picture tube are brought to a focus at the screen—to make a fine spot."
15856,"In this case, one wants to take electrons all of the same energy but with different initial angles and bring them together in a small spot."
15857,"The problem is like focusing light with a lens, and devices which do the corresponding job for particles are also called lenses."
15858,One example of an electron lens is sketched in Fig.
15859,29–5.
15860,It is an “electrostatic” lens whose operation depends on the electric field between two adjacent electrodes.
15861,Its operation can be understood by considering what happens to a parallel beam that enters from the left.
15862,"The forces are the same, but the time is shorter, so the impulse is less."
15863,"In leaving the high-voltage region, the particles get another kick toward the axis."
15864,"For distances not too far from the axis, the total impulse through the lens is proportional to the distance from the axis (Can you see why?"
15865,"), and this is just the condition necessary for lens-type focusing."
15866,You can use the same arguments to show that there is focusing if the potential of the middle electrode is either positive or negative with respect to the other two.
15867,Electrostatic lenses of this type are commonly used in cathode-ray tubes and in some electron microscopes.
15868,Another kind of lens—often found in electron microscopes—is the magnetic lens sketched schematically in Fig.
15869,29–6.
15870,"A cylindrically symmetric electromagnet has very sharp circular pole tips which produce a strong, nonuniform field in a small region."
15871,Electrons which travel vertically through this region are focused.
15872,You can understand the mechanism by looking at the magnified view of the pole-tip region drawn in Fig.
15873,29–7.
15874,"But then it will have a lateral velocity, so that when it passes through the strong vertical field, it will get an impulse toward the axis."
15875,"Its lateral motion is taken out by the magnetic force as it leaves the field, so the net effect is an impulse toward the axis, plus a “rotation” about the axis."
15876,"In the figure, the divergent electrons are brought into parallel paths."
15877,The action is like a lens with an object at the focal point.
15878,You know that electron microscopes can “see” objects too small to be seen by optical microscopes.
15879,We discussed in Chapter 30 of Vol.
15880,I the basic limitations of any optical system due to diffraction of the lens opening.
15881,Biology would be easy; we would have a photograph of the DNA structure.
15882,What a tremendous thing that would be!
15883,Most of present-day research in molecular biology is an attempt to figure out the shapes of complex organic molecules.
15884,If we could only see them!
15885,The reason is that no one has yet designed a lens with a large opening.
15886,"All lenses have “spherical aberration,” which means that rays at large angles from the axis have a different point of focus than the rays nearer the axis, as shown in Fig."
15887,29–9.
15888,"By special techniques, optical microscope lenses can be made with a negligible spherical aberration, but no one has yet been able to make an electron lens which avoids spherical aberration."
15889,"In fact, one can show that any electrostatic or magnetic lens of the types we have described must have an irreducible amount of spherical aberration."
15890,This aberration—together with diffraction—limits the resolving power of electron microscopes to their present value.
15891,The limitation we have mentioned does not apply to electric and magnetic fields which are not axially symmetric or which are not constant in time.
15892,Perhaps some day someone will think of a new kind of electron lens that will overcome the inherent aberration of the simple electron lens.
15893,Then we will be able to photograph atoms directly.
15894,Perhaps one day chemical compounds will be analyzed by looking at the positions of the atoms rather than by looking at the color of some precipitate!
15895,Magnetic fields are also used to produce special particle trajectories in high energy particle accelerators.
15896,Machines like the cyclotron and synchrotron bring particles to high energies by passing the particles repeatedly through a strong electric field.
15897,The particles are held in their cyclic orbits by a magnetic field.
15898,We have seen that a particle in a uniform magnetic field will go in a circular orbit.
15899,"This, however, is true only for a perfectly uniform field."
15900,"The radius of curvature will, however, be slightly smaller in the region where the field is stronger."
15901,"The orbit is not a closed circle but will “walk” through the field, as shown in Fig."
15902,29–10.
15903,"We can, if we wish, consider that the slight “error” in the field produces an extra angular kick which sends the particle off on a new track."
15904,"If the particles are to make millions of revolutions in an accelerator, some kind of “radial focusing” is needed which will tend to keep the trajectories close to some design orbit."
15905,Another difficulty with a uniform field is that the particles do not remain in a plane.
15906,If they start out with the slightest angle—or are given a slight angle by any small error in the field—they will go in a helical path that will eventually take them into the magnet pole or the ceiling or floor of the vacuum tank.
15907,Some arrangement must be made to inhibit such vertical drifts; the field must provide “vertical focusing” as well as radial focusing.
15908,"One would, at first, guess that radial focusing could be provided by making a magnetic field which increases with increasing distance from the center of the design path."
15909,"Then if a particle goes out to a large radius, it will be in a stronger field which will bend it back toward the correct radius."
15910,"If it goes to too small a radius, the bending will be less, and it will be returned toward the design radius."
15911,"If a particle is once started at some angle with respect to the ideal circle, it will oscillate about the ideal circular orbit, as shown in Fig."
15912,29–11.
15913,The radial focusing would keep the particles near the circular path.
15914,Actually there is still some radial focusing even with the opposite field slope.
15915,This can happen if the radius of curvature of the trajectory does not increase more rapidly than the increase in the distance of the particle from the center of the field.
15916,The particle orbits will be as drawn in Fig.
15917,29–12.
15918,"If the gradient of the field is too large, however, the orbits will not return to the design radius but will spiral inward or outward, as shown in Fig."
15919,29–13.
15920,A radial field gradient will also produce vertical forces on the particles.
15921,Suppose we have a field that is stronger nearer to the center of the orbit and weaker at the outside.
15922,A vertical cross section of the magnet at right angles to the orbit might be as shown in Fig.
15923,29–14.
15924,(For protons the orbits would be coming out of the page.)
15925,"If the field is to be stronger to the left and weaker to the right, the lines of the magnetic field must be curved as shown."
15926,The lines must be curved as shown.
15927,Such a field will have vertical focusing properties.
15928,Imagine a proton that is travelling more or less parallel to the central orbit but above it.
15929,"If the proton is below the central orbit, the force is reversed."
15930,So there is an effective “restoring force” toward the central orbit.
15931,"To explain how alternating-gradient focusing works, we will first describe the operation of a quadrupole lens, which is based on the same principle."
15932,Imagine that a uniform negative magnetic field is added to the field of Fig.
15933,"29–14, with the strength adjusted to make zero field at the orbit."
15934,The resulting field—for small displacements from the neutral point—would be like the field shown in Fig.
15935,29–15.
15936,Such a four-pole magnet is called a “quadrupole lens.” A positive particle that enters (from the reader) to the right or left of the center is pushed back toward the center.
15937,"If the particle enters above or below, it is pushed away from the center."
15938,This is a horizontal focusing lens.
15939,"If the horizontal gradient is reversed—as can be done by reversing all the polarities—the signs of all the forces are reversed and we have a vertical focusing lens, as in Fig."
15940,29–16.
15941,"For such lenses, the field strength—and therefore the focusing forces—increase linearly with the distance of the lens from the axis."
15942,Now imagine that two such lenses are placed in series.
15943,"If a particle enters with some horizontal displacement from the axis, as shown in Fig."
15944,"29–17(a), it will be deflected toward the axis in the first lens."
15945,"When it arrives at the second lens it is closer to the axis, so the force outward is less and the outward deflection is less."
15946,There is a net bending toward the axis; the average effect is horizontally focusing.
15947,"On the other hand, if we look at a particle which enters off the axis in the vertical direction, the path will be as shown in Fig."
15948,29–17(b).
15949,"The particle is first deflected away from the axis, but then it arrives at the second lens with a larger displacement, feels a stronger force, and so is bent toward the axis."
15950,Again the net effect is focusing.
15951,Thus a pair of quadrupole lenses acts independently for horizontal and vertical motion—very much like an optical lens.
15952,Quadrupole lenses are used to form and control beams of particles in much the same way that optical lenses are used for light beams.
15953,We should point out that an alternating-gradient system does not always produce focusing.
15954,"If the gradients are too large (in relation to the particle momentum or to the spacing between the lenses), the net effect can be a defocusing one."
15955,You can see how that could happen if you imagine that the spacing between the two lenses of Fig.
15956,"29–17 were increased, say, by a factor of three or four."
15957,Let’s return now to the synchrotron guide magnet.
15958,We can consider that it consists of an alternating sequence of “positive” and “negative” lenses with a superimposed uniform field.
15959,"The uniform field serves to bend the particles, on the average, in a horizontal circle (with no effect on the vertical motion), and the alternating lenses act on any particles that might tend to go astray—pushing them always toward the central orbit (on the average)."
15960,There is a nice mechanical analog which demonstrates that a force which alternates between a “focusing” force and a “defocusing” force can have a net “focusing” effect.
15961,"Imagine a mechanical “pendulum” which consists of a solid rod with a weight on the end, suspended from a pivot which is arranged to be moved rapidly up and down by a motor driven crank."
15962,Such a pendulum has two equilibrium positions.
15963,"Besides the normal, downward-hanging position, the pendulum is also in equilibrium “hanging upward”—with its “bob” above the pivot!"
15964,Such a pendulum is drawn in Fig.
15965,29–18.
15966,By the following argument you can see that the vertical pivot motion is equivalent to an alternating focusing force.
15967,"When the pivot is accelerated downward, the “bob” tends to move inward, as indicated in Fig."
15968,29–19.
15969,"When the pivot is accelerated upward, the effect is reversed."
15970,"The force restoring the “bob” toward the axis alternates, but the average effect is a force toward the axis."
15971,So the pendulum will swing back and forth about a neutral position which is just opposite the normal one.
15972,"There is, of course, a much easier way of keeping a pendulum upside down, and that is by balancing it on your finger!"
15973,But try to balance two independent sticks on the same finger!
15974,Or one stick with your eyes closed!
15975,Balancing involves making a correction for what is going wrong.
15976,"And this is not possible, in general, if there are several things going wrong at once."
15977,"In a synchrotron there are billions of particles going around together, each one of which may start out with a different “error.” The kind of focusing we have been describing works on them all."
15978,So far we have talked about particles in electric fields only or in magnetic fields only.
15979,There are some interesting effects when there are both kinds of fields at the same time.
15980,29–20.
15981,"(The figure is a plane curve, not a helix!)"
15982,We can understand this motion qualitatively.
15983,29–20 is a cycloid.
15984,Imagine an observer who is moving to the right at a constant speed.
15985,In his frame our magnetic field gets transformed to a new magnetic field plus an electric field in the downward direction.
15986,"If he has just the right speed, his total electric field will be zero, and he will see the electron going in a circle."
15987,"The motion of electrons in crossed electric and magnetic fields is the basis of the magnetron tubes, i.e., oscillators used for generating microwave energy."
15988,"There are many other interesting examples of particle motions in electric and magnetic fields—such as the orbits of the electrons and protons trapped in the Van Allen belts—but we do not, unfortunately, have the time to deal with them here."
15989,"We have finished the study of the basic laws of electricity and magnetism, and we are now going to study the electromagnetic properties of matter."
15990,"We begin by describing solids—that is, crystals."
15991,"When the atoms of matter are not moving around very much, they get stuck together and arrange themselves in a configuration with as low an energy as possible."
15992,"If the atoms in a certain place have found a pattern which seems to be of low energy, then the atoms somewhere else will probably make the same arrangement."
15993,"For these reasons, we have in a solid material a repetitive pattern of atoms."
15994,"In other words, the conditions in a crystal are this way: The environment of a particular atom in a crystal has a certain arrangement, and if you look at the same kind of an atom at another place farther along, you will find one whose surroundings are exactly the same."
15995,"If you pick an atom farther along by the same distance, you will find the conditions exactly the same once more."
15996,"The pattern is repeated over and over again—and, of course, in three dimensions."
15997,"Imagine the problem of designing a wallpaper—or a cloth, or some geometric design for a plane area—in which you are supposed to have a design element which repeats and repeats and repeats, so that you can make the area as large as you want."
15998,This is the two-dimensional analog of a problem which a crystal solves in three dimensions.
15999,"For example, Fig."
16000,30–1(a) shows a common kind of wallpaper design.
16001,There is a single element repeated in a pattern that can go on forever.
16002,"The geometric characteristics of this wallpaper design, considering only its repetition properties and not worrying about the geometry of the flower itself or its artistic merit, are contained in Fig."
16003,30–1(b).
16004,"There are, of course, many other directions."
16005,One of the basic properties of the pattern can be described by the two shortest steps to nearby equal positions.
16006,"By “equal” positions we mean that if you were to stand in any one of them and look around you, you would see exactly the same thing as if you were to stand in another one."
16007,That’s the fundamental property of a crystal.
16008,"The only difference is that a crystal is a three-dimensional arrangement instead of a two-dimensional arrangement; and naturally, instead of flowers, each element of the lattice is some kind of an arrangement of atoms—perhaps six hydrogen atoms and two carbon atoms—in some kind of pattern."
16009,The pattern of atoms in a crystal can be found out experimentally by x-ray diffraction.
16010,"We have mentioned this method briefly before, and won’t say any more now except that the precise arrangement of the atoms in space has been worked out for most simple crystals and also for some fairly complex ones."
16011,The internal pattern of a crystal shows up in several ways.
16012,"First, the binding strength of the atoms in certain directions is usually stronger than in other directions."
16013,This means that there are certain planes through the crystal where it is more easily broken than others.
16014,They are called the cleavage planes.
16015,If you crack a crystal with a knife blade it will often split apart along such a plane.
16016,"Second, the internal structure often appears at the surface because of the way the crystal was formed."
16017,Imagine a crystal being deposited out of a solution.
16018,There are the atoms floating around in the solution and finally settling down when they find a position of lowest energy.
16019,"(It’s as if the wallpaper got made by flowers drifting around until one drifted accidentally into place and got stuck, and then the next, and the next so that the pattern gradually grows.)"
16020,"You can appreciate that there will be certain directions in which it will grow at a different speed than in other directions, thereby growing into some kind of geometrical shape."
16021,"Because of such effects, the outside surfaces of many crystals show some of the character of the internal arrangement of the atoms."
16022,"For example, Fig."
16023,30–2(a) shows the shape of a typical quartz crystal whose internal pattern is hexagonal.
16024,"If you look closely at such a crystal, you will notice that the outside does not make a very good hexagon because the sides are not all of equal length—they are, in fact, often very unequal."
16025,"Clearly, the size of any particular face is an accident of the growth, but the angles are a representation of the internal geometry."
16026,"So every crystal of quartz has a different shape, even though the angles between corresponding faces are always the same."
16027,The internal geometry of a crystal of sodium chloride is also evident from its external shape.
16028,Figure 30–2(b) shows the shape of a typical grain of salt.
16029,"Again the crystal is not a perfect cube, but the faces are exactly at right angles to one another."
16030,"A more complicated crystal is mica, which has the shape shown in Fig."
16031,30–2(c).
16032,"It is a highly anisotropic crystal, as is easily seen from the fact that it is very tough if you try to pull it apart in one direction (horizontally in the figure), but very easy to split by pulling apart in the other direction (vertically)."
16033,"It has commonly been used to obtain very tough, thin sheets."
16034,Mica and quartz are two examples of natural minerals containing silica.
16035,"A third example of a mineral with silica is asbestos, which has the interesting property that it is easily pulled apart in two directions but not in the third."
16036,"It appears to be made of very strong, linear fibers."
16037,The mechanical properties of crystals clearly depend on the kind of chemical bindings between the atoms.
16038,The strikingly different strength of mica along different directions depends on the kinds of interatomic binding in the different directions.
16039,"You have already learned in chemistry, no doubt, about the different kinds of chemical bonds."
16040,"First, there are ionic bonds, as we have already discussed for sodium chloride."
16041,"Roughly speaking, the sodium atoms have lost an electron and become positive ions; the chlorine atoms have gained an electron and become negative ions."
16042,The positive and negative ions are arranged in a three-dimensional checkerboard and are held together by electrical forces.
16043,The covalent bond—in which electrons are shared between two atoms—is more common and is usually very strong.
16044,"In a diamond, for example, the carbon atoms have covalent bonds in all four directions to the nearest neighbors, so the crystal is very hard indeed."
16045,"There is also covalent bonding between silicon and oxygen in a quartz crystal, but there the bond is really only partially covalent."
16046,"Because there is not complete sharing of the electrons, the atoms are partly charged, and the crystal is somewhat ionic."
16047,Nature is not as simple as we try to make it; there are really all possible gradations between covalent and ionic bonding.
16048,A sugar crystal has still another kind of binding.
16049,"In it there are large molecules in which the atoms are held strongly together by covalent bonds, so that the molecule is a tough structure."
16050,"But since the strong bonds are completely satisfied, there are only relatively weak attractions between the separate, individual molecules."
16051,"In such molecular crystals the molecules keep their individual identity, so to speak, and the internal arrangement might be as shown in Fig."
16052,30–3.
16053,"Since the molecules are not held strongly to each other, the crystals are easy to break."
16054,"They are quite different from something like diamond, which is really one giant molecule that cannot be broken anywhere without disrupting strong covalent bonds."
16055,Paraffin is another example of a molecular crystal.
16056,An extreme example of a molecular crystal occurs in a substance like solid argon.
16057,There is very little attraction between the atoms—each atom is a completely saturated monatomic molecule.
16058,"But at very low temperatures, the thermal motion is very small, so the slight interatomic forces can cause the atoms to settle down into a regular array like a pile of closely packed spheres."
16059,The metals form a completely different class of substances.
16060,The bonding is of an entirely different kind.
16061,In a metal the bonding is not between adjacent atoms but is a property of the whole crystal.
16062,The valence electrons are not attached to one atom or to a pair of atoms but are shared throughout the crystal.
16063,"Each atom contributes an electron to a universal pool of electrons, and the atomic positive ions reside in the sea of negative electrons."
16064,The electron sea holds the ions together like some kind of glue.
16065,"In the metals, since there are no special bonds in any particular direction, there is no strong directionality in the binding."
16066,"They are still crystalline, however, because the total energy is lowest when the atomic ions are arranged in some definite array—although the energy of the preferred arrangement is not usually much lower than other possible ones."
16067,"To a first approximation, the atoms of many metals are like small spheres packed in as tightly as possible."
16068,Try to imagine the natural formation of crystals in the earth.
16069,In the earth’s surface there is a big mixture of all kinds of atoms.
16070,"They are being continually churned about by volcanic action, by wind, and by water—continually being moved about and mixed."
16071,"Yet, by some trick, silicon atoms gradually begin to find each other, and to find oxygen atoms, to make silica."
16072,One atom at a time is added to the others to build up a crystal—the mixture gets unmixed.
16073,"And somewhere nearby, sodium and chlorine atoms are finding each other and building up a crystal of salt."
16074,"How does it happen that once a crystal is started, it permits only a particular kind of atom to join on?"
16075,It happens because the whole system is working toward the lowest possible energy.
16076,A growing crystal will accept a new atom if it is going to make the energy as low as possible.
16077,But how does it know that a silicon—or an oxygen—atom at some particular spot is going to result in the lowest possible energy?
16078,It does it by trial and error.
16079,"In the liquid, all of the atoms are in perpetual motion."
16080,"If it hits against the right spot of growing crystal, it has a somewhat smaller chance of jumping off again if the energy is low."
16081,Eventually they grow into big crystals.
16082,The arrangement of the atoms in a crystal—the crystal lattice—can take on many geometric forms.
16083,"We would like to describe first the simplest lattices, which are characteristic of most of the metals and of the solid form of the inert gases."
16084,"They are the cubic lattices which can occur in two forms: the body-centered cubic, shown in Fig."
16085,"30–4(a), and the face-centered cubic shown in Fig."
16086,30–4(b).
16087,"The drawings show, of course, only one cube of the lattice; you are to imagine that the pattern is repeated indefinitely in three dimensions."
16088,"Also, to make the drawing clearer, only the “centers” of the atoms are shown."
16089,"In an actual crystal, the atoms are more like spheres in contact with each other."
16090,"The dark and light spheres in the drawings may, in general, stand for different kinds of atoms or may be the same kind."
16091,"For instance, iron has a body-centered cubic lattice at low temperatures, but a face-centered cubic lattice at higher temperatures."
16092,The physical properties are quite different in the two crystalline forms.
16093,How do such forms come about?
16094,Imagine that you have the problem of packing spherical atoms together as tightly as possible.
16095,"One way would be to start by making a layer in a “hexagonal close-packed array,” as shown in Fig."
16096,30–5(a).
16097,"Then you could build up a second layer like the first, but displaced horizontally, as shown in Fig."
16098,30–5(b).
16099,"Next, you can put on the third layer."
16100,But notice!
16101,There are two distinct ways of placing the third layer.
16102,"30–5(b), each atom in the third layer is directly above an atom of the bottom layer."
16103,It seems funny that starting with hexagons you can end up with cubes.
16104,But notice that a cube looked at from a corner has a hexagonal outline.
16105,"For instance, Fig."
16106,30–6 could represent a plane hexagon or a cube seen in perspective!
16107,If a third layer is added to Fig.
16108,It is clear that both possibilities we have described are equally close-packed.
16109,"Some metals—for example, copper and silver—choose the first alternative, the face-centered cubic."
16110,"Others—for example, beryllium and magnesium—choose the other alternatives; they form hexagonal crystals."
16111,"Clearly, which crystal lattice appears cannot depend only on the packing of little spheres, but must also be determined in part by other factors."
16112,"In particular, it depends on the slight remaining angular dependence of the interatomic forces (or, in the case of the metals, on the energy of the electron pool)."
16113,"You will, no doubt, learn all about such things in your chemistry courses."
16114,We would now like to discuss some of the properties of crystals from the point of view of their internal symmetries.
16115,"The main feature of a crystal is that if you start at one atom and move to a corresponding atom one lattice unit away, you are again in the same kind of an environment."
16116,That’s the fundamental proposition.
16117,"But if you were an atom, there would be another kind of change that could take you again to the same environment—that is, another possible “symmetry.” Figure 30–7(a) shows another possible “wallpaper-type” design (though one you have probably never seen)."
16118,"You might, at first, think that they are the same—but not quite."
16119,There are other kinds of “equivalent” points in the pattern.
16120,The pattern is quite special.
16121,"A crystal with such a structure would have square corners on the outside, but inside it is more complicated than a simple cube."
16122,"Now that we have described some special examples, let’s try to figure out all the possible symmetries a crystal can have."
16123,"First, we consider what happens in a plane."
16124,A plane lattice can be defined by the two so-called primitive vectors that go from one point of the lattice to the two nearest equivalent points.
16125,30–1.
16126,30–7(a) are the primitive vectors of the pattern there.
16127,We see that there are lattices which have a “four-sided” symmetry.
16128,And we have described earlier a close-packed array based on a hexagon which could have a six-sided symmetry.
16129,A rotation of the array of circles in Fig.
16130,What other kinds of rotational symmetry are there?
16131,"Can we have, for example, a fivefold or an eightfold rotational symmetry?"
16132,It is easy to see that they are impossible.
16133,The only symmetry with more sides than four is a six-sided symmetry.
16134,"First, let’s show that more than sixfold symmetry is impossible."
16135,30–8(a).
16136,Octagonal symmetry is not possible.
16137,What about fivefold symmetry?
16138,There can be no fivefold symmetry.
16139,"One way of stating our result is that the pattern can be left unchanged by a rotation of one full turn (no change at all), one-half of a turn, one-third, one-fourth, or one-sixth of a turn."
16140,And those are all the possible rotational symmetries in a plane—a total of five.
16141,Returning to Fig.
16142,"30–7(a), we see that the pattern has a fourfold rotational symmetry."
16143,We have drawn in Fig.
16144,30–7(b) another design which has the same symmetry properties as part (a).
16145,The little comma-like figures are asymmetric objects which serve to define the symmetry of the design inside of each square.
16146,"Notice that the commas are reversed in alternate squares, so that the unit cell is larger than one of the small squares."
16147,"If there were no commas, the pattern would still have fourfold symmetry, but the unit cell would be smaller."
16148,The patterns of Fig.
16149,30–7 also have other symmetry properties.
16150,The patterns of Fig.
16151,30–7 have still another kind of symmetry.
16152,These are all the possible symmetries in two dimensions.
16153,It is inversion.
16154,An inversion of pattern (a) of Fig.
16155,"30–9 produces a new pattern, but an inversion of pattern (b) reproduces the same pattern."
16156,"Suppose, however, we make the pattern in Fig."
16157,"After an inversion in three dimensions all the arrows will be reversed, so the pattern is not reproduced."
16158,"If we indicate the heads and tails of the arrows by dots and crosses, respectively, we can make a three-dimensional pattern, as in Fig."
16159,"30–9(c), which is not symmetric under an inversion, or we can make a pattern like the one shown in (d), which does have such a symmetry."
16160,Notice that it is not possible to imitate a three-dimensional inversion by any combination of rotations.
16161,We have drawn one pattern of the lowest possible symmetry in Fig.
16162,"30–1, and one of high symmetry in Fig."
16163,30–7.
16164,One always sees the same three or four basic patterns.
16165,"Is this because of a lack of imagination of designers, or because many of the possible patterns are not pleasing to the eye?"
16166,So far we have talked only about patterns in two dimensions.
16167,"What we are really interested in, however, are patterns of atoms in three dimensions."
16168,"First, it is clear that a three-dimensional crystal will have three primitive vectors."
16169,30–10.
16170,The lattice with the least symmetry is called the triclinic.
16171,Its unit cell is a parallelepiped.
16172,"The primitive vectors are of different lengths, and no two of the angles between them are equal."
16173,There is no possibility of any rotational or reflection symmetry.
16174,"There are, however, still two possible symmetries—the unit cell is, or is not, changed by an inversion through the vertex."
16175,"So the triclinic lattice has only two possible symmetries, unless there is some special relation among the primitive vectors."
16176,"For example, if all the vectors are equal and are separated by equal angles, one has the trigonal lattice shown in the figure."
16177,"This figure can have an additional symmetry; it may be unchanged by a rotation about the long, body diagonal."
16178,"If all three primitive vectors are at right angles, but of different lengths, we get the orthorhombic cell."
16179,"Higher-order symmetries are possible with the tetragonal cell, which has all right angles and two equal primitive vectors."
16180,"Finally, there is the cubic cell, which is the most symmetric of all."
16181,The point of all this discussion about symmetries is that the internal symmetries of the crystals show up—sometimes in subtle ways—in the macroscopic physical properties of the crystal.
16182,"For instance, a crystal will, in general, have a tensor electric polarizability."
16183,"If we describe the tensor in terms of the ellipsoid of polarization, we should expect that some of the crystal symmetries should show up also in the ellipsoid."
16184,"Clearly, the only ellipsoid with this property is a sphere."
16185,A cubic crystal must be an isotropic dielectric.
16186,"On the other hand, a tetragonal crystal has a fourfold rotational symmetry."
16187,"Its ellipsoid must have two of its principal axes equal, and the third must be parallel to the axis of the crystal."
16188,"Similarly, since the orthorhombic crystal has twofold rotational symmetry about three orthogonal axes, its axes must coincide with the axes of the polarization ellipsoid."
16189,"In a like manner, one of the axes of a monoclinic crystal must be parallel to one of the principal axes of the ellipsoid, though we can’t say anything about the other axes."
16190,"Since a triclinic crystal has no rotational symmetry, the ellipsoid can have any orientation at all."
16191,"As you can see, we can make a big game of figuring out the possible symmetries and relating them to the possible physical tensors."
16192,"We have considered only the polarization tensor, but things get more complicated for others—for instance, for the tensor of elasticity."
16193,"There is a branch of mathematics called “group theory” that deals with such subjects, but usually you can figure out what you want with common sense."
16194,We have said that metals usually have a simple cubic crystal structure; we want now to discuss their mechanical properties—which depend on this structure.
16195,"Metals are, generally speaking, very “soft,” because it is easy to slide one layer of the crystal over the next."
16196,"You may think: “That’s ridiculous; metals are strong.” Not so, a single crystal of a metal can be distorted very easily."
16197,"Suppose we look at two layers of a crystal subjected to a shear force, as shown in the diagram of Fig."
16198,30–11(a).
16199,"You might at first think the whole layer would resist motion until the force was big enough to push the whole layer “over the hump,” so that it shifted one notch to the left."
16200,"Although slipping does occur along a plane, it doesn’t happen that way."
16201,"(If it did, you would calculate that the metal is much stronger than it really is.)"
16202,"What happens is more like one atom going at a time; first the atom on the left makes its jump, then the next, and so on, as indicated in Fig."
16203,30–11(b).
16204,"In effect it is the vacant space between two atoms that quickly travels to the right, with the net result that the whole second layer has moved over one atomic spacing."
16205,The slipping goes this way because it takes much less energy to lift one atom at a time over the hump than to lift a whole row.
16206,"Once the force is enough to start the process, it goes the rest of the way very fast."
16207,"It turns out that in a real crystal, slipping will occur repeatedly at one plane, then will stop there and start at some other plane."
16208,The details of why it starts and stops are quite mysterious.
16209,"It is, in fact, quite strange that successive regions of slip are often fairly evenly spaced."
16210,Figure 30–12 shows a photograph of a tiny thin copper crystal that has been stretched.
16211,You can see the various planes where slipping has occurred.
16212,The sudden slipping of individual crystal planes is quite apparent if you take a piece of tin wire that has large crystals in it and stretch it while holding it next to your ear.
16213,"You can hear a rush of “ticks” as the planes snap to their new positions, one after the other."
16214,The problem of having a “missing” atom in one row is somewhat more difficult than it might appear from Fig.
16215,30–11.
16216,"When there are more layers, the situation must be something like that shown in Fig."
16217,30–13.
16218,Such an imperfection in a crystal is called a dislocation.
16219,It is presumed that such dislocations are either present when the crystal was formed or are generated at some notch or crack at the surface.
16220,"Once they are produced, they can move relatively freely through the crystal."
16221,The gross distortions result from the motions of many of such dislocations.
16222,"Dislocations can move freely—that is, they require little extra energy—so long as the rest of the crystal has a perfect lattice."
16223,But they may get “stuck” if they encounter some other kind of imperfection in the crystal.
16224,"If it takes a lot of energy for them to pass the imperfection, they will be stopped."
16225,This is precisely the mechanism that gives strength to imperfect metal crystals.
16226,"Pure iron crystals are quite soft, but a small concentration of impurity atoms may cause enough imperfections to effectively immobilize the dislocations."
16227,"As you know, steel, which is primarily iron, is very hard."
16228,"To make steel, a small amount of carbon is dissolved in the iron melt; if the melt is cooled rapidly, the carbon precipitates out in little grains, making many microscopic distortions in the lattice."
16229,"The dislocations can no longer move about, and the metal is hard."
16230,"Pure copper is very soft, but can be “work-hardened.” This is done by hammering on it or bending it back and forth."
16231,"In this case, many new dislocations of various kinds are made which interfere with one another, cutting down their mobility."
16232,Perhaps you’ve seen the trick of taking a bar of “dead soft” copper and gently bending it around someone’s wrist as a bracelet.
16233,"In the process, it becomes work-hardened and cannot easily be unbent again!"
16234,A work-hardened metal like copper can be made soft again by annealing at a high temperature.
16235,The thermal motion of the atoms “irons out” the dislocations and makes large single crystals again.
16236,"We have, so far, described only the so-called slip dislocation."
16237,"There are many other kinds, one of which is the screw dislocation shown in Fig."
16238,30–14.
16239,Such dislocations often play an important part in crystal growth.
16240,One of the great puzzles for a long time was how crystals can possibly grow.
16241,"We have described how it is that each atom might, by repeated testing, determine whether it was better to be in the crystal or not."
16242,But that means that each atom must find a place of low energy.
16243,"However, an atom put on a new surface is only bound by one or two bonds from below, and doesn’t have the same energy it would have if it were placed in a corner, where it would have atoms on three sides."
16244,"Suppose we imagine a growing crystal as a stack of blocks, as shown in Fig."
16245,30–15.
16246,"With so many bonds lacking, its energy is not very low."
16247,"What happens, though, when that line is finished?"
16248,"To start a new line, an atom must come to rest with only two sides attached, and that is again not very likely."
16249,"Even if it did, what would happen when the layer was finished?"
16250,How could a new layer get started?
16251,"One answer is that the crystal prefers to grow at a dislocation, for instance around a screw dislocation like the one shown in Fig."
16252,30–14.
16253,"As blocks are added to this crystal, there is always some place where there are three available bonds."
16254,"The crystal prefers, therefore, to grow with a dislocation built in."
16255,Such a spiral pattern of growth is shown in Fig.
16256,"30–16, which is a photograph of a single crystal of paraffin."
16257,"We cannot, of course, see what goes on with the individual atoms in a crystal."
16258,"Also, as you realize by now, there are many complicated phenomena that are not easy to treat quantitatively."
16259,Sir Lawrence Bragg and J. F. Nye have devised a scheme for making a model of a metallic crystal which shows in a striking way many of the phenomena that are believed to occur in a real metal.
16260,"In the following pages we have reproduced their original article, which describes their method and shows some of the results they obtained with it."
16261,"(The article is reprinted from the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Vol."
16262,"190, September 1947, pp."
16263,474–481—with the permission of the authors and of the Royal Society.)
16264," Models of crystal structure have been described from time to time in which the atoms are represented by small floating or suspended magnets, or by circular disks floating on a water surface and held together by the forces of capillary attraction."
16265,"These models have certain disadvantages; for instance, in the case of floating objects in contact, frictional forces impede their free relative movement."
16266,"A more serious disadvantage is that the number of components is limited, for a large number of components is required in order to approach the state of affairs in a real crystal."
16267,in diameter floating on the surface of a soap solution.
16268,"These small bubbles are sufficiently persistent for experiments lasting an hour or more, they slide past each other without friction, and they can be produced in large numbers."
16269,"The model most nearly represents the behaviour of a metal structure, because the bubbles are of one type only and are held together by a general capillary attraction, which represents the binding force of the free electrons in the metal."
16270,A brief description of the model has been given in the Journal of Scientific Instruments (Bragg 1942b).
16271," The bubbles are blown from a fine orifice, beneath the surface of a soap solution."
16272,We have had the best results with a solution the formula of which was given to us by Mr Green of the Royal Institution.
16273,of distilled water.
16274,of pure glycerine.
16275,It is left to stand and the clear liquid is drawn off from below.
16276,In some experiments this was diluted in three times its volume of water to reduce viscosity.
16277,below the surface.
16278,of water is supplied by means of two Winchester flasks.
16279,Normally the bubbles are remarkably uniform in size.
16280,"Occasionally they issue in an irregular manner, but this can be corrected by a change of jet or of pressure."
16281,Unwanted bubbles can easily be destroyed by playing a small flame over the surface.
16282,Figure 1 shows the apparatus.
16283,"We have found it of advantage to blacken the bottom of the vessel, because details of structure, such as grain boundaries and dislocations, then show up more clearly."
16284," Figure 2, plate 8, shows a portion of a raft or two-dimensional crystal of bubbles."
16285,Its regularity can be judged by looking at the figure in a glancing direction.
16286,"The size of the bubbles varies with the aperture, but does not appear to vary to any marked degree with the pressure or the depth of the orifice beneath the surface."
16287,The main effect of increasing the pressure is to increase the rate of issue of the bubbles.

16290,"diameter as ‘small’ bubbles, since their behaviour varies with their size."
16291,"As it was desired to experiment with very small bubbles, we had recourse to placing the soap solution in a rotating vessel and introducing a fine jet as nearly as possible parallel to a stream line."
16292,"The bubbles are swept away as they form, and under steady conditions are reasonably uniform."
16293,"They issue at a rate of one thousand or more per second, giving a high-pitched note."
16294,"The soap solution mounts up in a steep wall around the perimeter of the vessel while it is rotating, but carries back most of the bubbles with it when rotation ceases."

16298,"Figure 4, plate 8, is an enlarged picture of these ‘small’ bubbles and shows their degree of regularity; the pattern is not as perfect with a rotating as with a stationary vessel, the rows being seen to be slightly irregular when viewed in a glancing direction."
16299," These two-dimensional crystals show structures which have been supposed to exist in metals, and simulate effects which have been observed, such as grain boundaries, dislocations and other types of fault, slip, recrystallization, annealing, and strains due to ‘foreign’ atoms."
16300,diameter respectively.
16301,"The width of the disturbed area at the boundary, where the bubbles have an irregular distribution, is in general greater the smaller the bubbles."
16302,"In figure 5a, which shows portions of several adjacent grains, bubbles at a boundary between two grains adhere definitely to one crystalline arrangement or the other."
16303,In figure 5c there is a marked ‘Beilby layer’ between the two grains.
16304,"The small bubbles, as will be seen, have a greater rigidity than the large ones, and this appears to give rise to more irregularity at the interface."
16305," Separate grains show up distinctly when photographs of polycrystalline rafts such as figures 5a to 5c, plates 9 and 10, and figures 12a to 12e, plates 14 to 16, are viewed obliquely."
16306,"With suitable lighting, the floating raft of bubbles itself when viewed obliquely resembles a polished and etched metal in a remarkable way."
16307," It often happens that some ‘impurity atoms’, or bubbles which are markedly larger or smaller than the average, are found in a polycrystalline raft, and when this is so a large proportion of them are situated at the grain boundaries."
16308,"It would be incorrect to say that the irregular bubbles make their way to the boundaries; it is a defect of the model that no diffusion of bubbles through the structure can take place, mutual adjustments of neighbours alone being possible."
16309,It appears that the boundaries tend to readjust themselves by the growth of one crystal at the expense of another till they pass through the irregular atoms.
16310," When a single crystal or polycrystalline raft is compressed, extended, or otherwise deformed it exhibits a behaviour very similar to that which has been pictured for metals subjected to strain."
16311,Up to a certain limit the model is within its elastic range.
16312,Beyond that point it yields by slip along one of the three equally inclined directions of closely packed rows.
16313,Slip takes place by the bubbles in one row moving forward over those in the next row by an amount equal to the distance between neighbours.
16314,It is very interesting to watch this process taking place.
16315,"The movement is not simultaneous along the whole row but begins at one end with the appearance of a ‘dislocation’, where there is locally one more bubble in the rows on one side of the slip line as compared with those on the other."
16316,"This dislocation then runs along the slip line from one side of the crystal to the other, the final result being a slip by one ‘inter-atomic’ distance."
16317,"Such a process has been invoked by Orowan, by Polanyi and by Taylor to explain the small forces required to produce plastic gliding in metal structures."
16318,The theory put forward by Taylor (1934) to explain the mechanism of plastic deformation of crystals considers the mutual action and equilibrium of such dislocations.
16319,The bubbles afford a very striking picture of what has been supposed to take place in the metal.
16320,"Sometimes the dislocations run along quite slowly, taking a matter of seconds to cross a crystal; stationary dislocations also are to be seen in crystals which are not homogeneously strained."
16321,"They appear as short black lines, and can be seen in the series of photographs, figures 12a to 12e, plates 14 to 16."
16322,"When a polycrystalline raft is compressed, these dark lines are seen to be dashing about in all directions across the crystals."
16323," Figures 6a, 6b and 6c, plates 10 and 11, show examples of dislocations."
16324,its influence can be traced for a length of about fifty bubbles.
16325,The greater rigidity of the small bubbles leads to longer dislocations.
16326,"The study of any mass of bubbles shows, however, that there is not a standard length of dislocation for each size."
16327,The length depends upon the nature of the strain in the crystal.
16328,"As the angle between the neighbouring crystals decreases, the dislocations occur at wider intervals and at the same time become longer, till one finally has single dislocations in a large body of perfect structure as shown in figures 6a, 6b and 6c."
16329," Figure 7, plate 11, shows three parallel dislocations."
16330,"If we call them positive and negative (following Taylor) they are positive, negative, positive, reading from left to right."
16331,"The strip between the last two has three bubbles in excess, as can be seen by looking along the rows in a horizontal direction."
16332,"Figure 8, plate 12, shows a dislocation projecting from a grain boundary, an effect often observed."
16333," Figure 9, plate 12, shows a place where two bubbles take the place of one."
16334,"This may be regarded as a limiting case of positive and negative dislocations on neighbouring rows, with the compressive sides of the dislocations facing each other."
16335,"The contrary case would lead to a hole in the structure, one bubble being missing at the point where the dislocations met."
16336," Figure 10, plate 12, shows a narrow strip between two crystals of parallel orientation, the strip being crossed by a number of fault lines where the bubbles are not in close packing."
16337,It is in such places as these that recrystallization may be expected.
16338,The boundaries approach and the strip is absorbed into a wider area of perfect crystal.
16339," Figures 11a to 11g, plates 13 and 14 are examples of arrangements which frequently appear in places where there is a local deficiency of bubbles."
16340,"While a dislocation is seen as a dark stripe in a general view, these structures show up in the shape of the letter V or as triangles."
16341,A typical V structure is seen in figure 11a.
16342,"Figure 11b shows a small triangle, which also embodies a dislocation, for it will be noticed that the rows below the fault have one more bubble than these below."
16343,"If a mild amount of ‘thermal movement’ is imposed by gentle agitation of one side of the crystal, such faulty places disappear and a perfect structure is formed."
16344," Here and there in the crystals there is a blank space where a bubble is missing, showing as a black dot in a general view."
16345,Examples occur in figure 11g.
16346,"Such a gap cannot be closed by a local readjustment, since filling the hole causes another to appear."
16347,Such holes both appear and disappear when the crystal is ‘cold-worked’.
16348,These structures in the model suggest that similar local faults may exist in an actual metal.
16349,"They may play a part in processes such as diffusion or the order-disorder change by reducing energy barriers in their neighbourhood, and act as nuclei for crystallization in an allotropic change."
16350," Figures 12a to 12e, plates 14 to 16, show the same raft of bubbles at successive times."
16351,"A raft covering the surface of the solution was given a vigorous stirring with a glass rake, and then left to adjust itself."
16352,after stirring has ceased.
16353,The raft is broken into a number of small ‘crystallites’; these are in a high state of non-homogeneous strain as is shown by the numerous dislocations and other faults.
16354,later.
16355,"The small grains have coalesced to form larger grains, and much of the strain has disappeared in the process."
16356,after the initial stirring.
16357,"It is not possible to follow the rearrangement for much longer times, because the bubbles shrink after long standing, apparently due to the diffusion of air through their walls, and they also become thin and tend to burst."
16358,No agitation was given to the model during this process.
16359,"An ever slower process of rearrangement goes on, the movement of the bubbles in one part of the raft setting up strains which activate a rearrangement in a neighbouring part, and that in its turn still another."
16360, A number of interesting points are to be seen in this series.
16361,"Dislocations of various lengths can be seen, marking all stages between a slight warping of the structure and a definite boundary."
16362,Holes where bubbles are missing show up as black dots.
16363,"Some of these holes are formed or filled up by movements of dislocations, but others represent places where a bubble has burst."
16364,Many examples of V’s and some of triangles can be seen.
16365,Other interesting points will be apparent from a study of this series of photographs.
16366,"after the stirring process, and is interesting as showing two successive stages in the relaxation towards a more perfect arrangement."
16367,The changes show up well when one looks in a glancing direction across the page.
16368,The arrangement is very broken in figure 13a.
16369,"In figure 13b the bubbles have grouped themselves in rows, but the curvature of these rows indicates a high degree of internal strain."
16370,It would appear that the energy of this strained crystal is greater than that of the intercrystalline boundary.
16371,"We are indebted to Messrs Kodak for the photographs of figure 13, which were taken when the cinematograph film referred to below was produced."
16372," Figure 14, plate 18, shows the widespread effect of a bubble which is of the wrong size."
16373,"If this figure is compared with the perfect rafts shown in figures 2 and 4, plate 8, it will be seen that three bubbles, one larger and two smaller than normal, disturb the regularity of the rows over the whole of the figure."
16374,"As has been mentioned above, bubbles of the wrong size are generally found in the grain boundaries, where holes of irregular size occur which can accommodate them."
16375, The mechanical properties of a two-dimensional perfect raft have been described in the paper referred to above (Bragg 1942b).
16376,The raft lies between two parallel springs dipping horizontally in the surface of the soap solution.
16377,"The pitch of the springs is adjusted to fit the spacing of the rows of bubbles, which then adhere firmly to them."
16378,"One spring can be translated parallel to itself by a micrometer screw, and the other is supported by two thin vertical glass fibres."
16379,The shearing stress can be measured by noting the deflexion of the glass fibres.
16380,"When subjected to a shearing strain, the raft obeys Hooke’s law of elasticity up to the point where the elastic limit is reached."
16381,It then slips along some intermediate row by an amount equal to the width of one bubble.
16382,The elastic shear and slip can be repeated several times.
16383,The elastic limit is approximately reached when one side of the raft has been sheared by an amount equal to a bubble width past the other side.
16384,"This feature supports the basic assumption made by one of us in the calculation of the elastic limit of a metal (Bragg 1942a), in which it is supposed that each crystallite in a cold-worked metal only yields when the strain in it has reached such a value that energy is released by the slip."
16385," A calculation has been made by M. M. Nicolson of the forces between the bubbles, and will be published shortly."
16386,It shows two interesting points.
16387,The curve for the variation of potential energy with distance between centres is very similar to those which have been plotted for atoms.
16388,"It has a minimum for a distance between centres slightly less than a free bubble diameter, and rises sharply for smaller distances."
16389,"diameter, thus confirming the impression given by the model that the small bubbles behave as if they were much more rigid than the large ones."
16390," If the bubbles are allowed to accumulate in multiple layers on the surface, they form a mass of three-dimensional ‘crystals’ with one of the arrangements of closest packing."
16391,"Figure 15, plate 18, shows an oblique view of such a mass; its resemblance to a polished and etched metal surface is noticeable."
16392,"In figure 16, plate 20, a similar mass is seen viewed normally."
16393,"Figure 17d, plate 19, appears to show both the cubic and hexagonal succession of closely packed planes, but it is difficult to verify whether the left-hand side follows the true hexagonal close-packed structure because it is not certain that the assemblage had a depth of more than two layers at this point."
16394,"Many instances of twins, and of intercrystalline boundaries, can be seen in figure 16, plate 20."
16395," Figure 18, plate 21, shows several dislocations in a three-dimensional structure subjected to a bending strain."
16396,"cinematograph film has been made of the movements of the dislocations and grain boundaries when single crystal and polycrystalline rafts are sheared, compressed, or extended."
16397,"Moreover, if the soap solution is placed in a glass vessel with a flat bottom, the model lends itself to projection on a large scale by transmitted light."
16398,"Since a certain depth is required for producing the bubbles, and the solution is rather opaque, it is desirable to make the projection through a glass block resting on the bottom of the vessel and just submerged beneath the surface."
16399," In conclusion, we wish to express our thanks to Mr C. E. Harrold, of King’s College, Cambridge, who made for us some of the pipettes which were used to produce the bubbles."
16400,"Physicists always have a habit of taking the simplest example of any phenomenon and calling it “physics,” leaving the more complicated examples to become the concern of other fields—say of applied mathematics, electrical engineering, chemistry, or crystallography."
16401,Even solid-state physics is almost only half physics because it worries too much about special substances.
16402,So in these lectures we will be leaving out many interesting things.
16403,"For instance, one of the important properties of crystals—or of most substances—is that their electric polarizability is different in different directions."
16404,"If you apply a field in any direction, the atomic charges shift a little and produce a dipole moment, but the magnitude of the moment depends very much on the direction of the field."
16405,"That is, of course, quite a complication."
16406,"But in physics we usually start out by talking about the special case in which the polarizability is the same in all directions, to make life easier."
16407,We leave the other cases to some other field.
16408,"Therefore, for our later work, we will not need at all what we are going to talk about in this chapter."
16409,The mathematics of tensors is particularly useful for describing properties of substances which vary in direction—although that’s only one example of their use.
16410,"Since most of you are not going to become physicists, but are going to go into the real world, where things depend severely upon direction, sooner or later you will need to use tensors."
16411,"In order not to leave anything out, we are going to describe tensors, although not in great detail."
16412,We want the feeling that our treatment of physics is complete.
16413,"For example, our electrodynamics is complete—as complete as any electricity and magnetism course, even a graduate course."
16414,"Our mechanics is not complete, because we studied mechanics when you didn’t have a high level of mathematical sophistication, and we were not able to discuss subjects like the principle of least action, or Lagrangians, or Hamiltonians, and so on, which are more elegant ways of describing mechanics."
16415,"Except for general relativity, however, we do have the complete laws of mechanics."
16416,"Our electricity and magnetism is complete, and a lot of other things are quite complete."
16417,"The quantum mechanics, naturally, will not be—we have to leave something for the future."
16418,But you should at least know what a tensor is.
16419,We emphasized in Chapter 30 that the properties of crystalline substances are different in different directions—we say they are anisotropic.
16420,"The variation of the induced dipole moment with the direction of the applied electric field is only one example, the one we will use for our example of a tensor."
16421,31–1(a).
16422,The polarization is no longer in the same direction as the electric field.
16423,You can see how that might come about.
16424,"There may be charges which can move easily up and down, but which are rather stiff for sidewise motions."
16425,"The displacements are not in the direction of the external force, because there are asymmetric internal elastic forces."
16426,It is generally true that the induced polarization of a crystal is not in the direction of the electric field.
16427,Then the polarizations would be as shown in Fig.
16428,"31–1(b), instead of as in part (a)."
16429,We want now to treat the general case of an arbitrary orientation of a crystal with respect to the coordinate axes.
16430,(31.1) and (31.2).
16431,"(31.1), (31.2), and (31.3)."
16432,"It is fairly messy, but quite straightforward."
16433,When we talk about changing the axes we are assuming that the crystal stays put in space.
16434,"But if they are known for any one orientation of the crystal, they can be found for any other orientation by the transformation we have just described."
16435,"Many special notations have been invented for dealing with tensors, but each of them is convenient only for a limited class of problems."
16436,"Since we will be using tensors so little, we will not bother to adopt any such special notations or conventions."
16437,We want now to get some experience with tensors.
16438,Consider for a moment the atomic charges that are being displaced.
16439,"A tensor has then the property that when it is summed over one index (with a vector), it gives a new vector; and when it is summed over both indexes (with two vectors), it gives a scalar."
16440,"A vector—with one index—is a tensor of the first rank, and a scalar—with no index—is a tensor of zero rank."
16441,"It is possible to extend the ideas of a tensor to three or more indexes, and so to make tensors of ranks higher than two."
16442,The subscripts of the polarization tensor range over three possible values—they are tensors in three dimensions.
16443,"The mathematicians consider tensors in four, five, or more dimensions."
16444,(This is a physical property of a real crystal and not necessary for all tensors.)
16445,"The crystal is now back where it started, and the net work done on the polarization must be back to zero."
16446,So the polarization tensor is symmetric.
16447,This also means that the polarization tensor can be measured by just measuring the energy required to polarize the crystal in various directions.
16448,"The energy expression, Eq."
16449,"(31.8), has a nice geometric interpretation."
16450,31–2).
16451,"(It must be an ellipse, rather than a parabola or a hyperbola, because the energy for any field is always positive and finite.)"
16452,So such an “energy ellipse” is a nice way of “visualizing” the polarization tensor.
16453,31–3.
16454,The shape of this ellipsoid of constant energy uniquely characterizes the tensor polarizability.
16455,Now an ellipsoid has the nice property that it can always be described simply by giving the directions of three “principal axes” and the diameters of the ellipse along these axes.
16456,The “principal axes” are the directions of the longest and shortest diameters and the direction at right angles to both.
16457,31–3.
16458,"That is to say, no matter how complicated a crystal is, it is always possible to choose a set of axes (not necessarily the crystal axes) for which the polarization tensor has only three components."
16459,"With such a set of axes, Eq."
16460,The material is isotropic.
16461,The polarization tensor of Eq.
16462,The shape and orientation of the polarization ellipsoid can sometimes be related to the symmetry properties of the crystal.
16463,Now the ellipsoid of polarizability must share the internal geometric symmetries of the crystal.
16464,"For example, a triclinic crystal has low symmetry—the ellipsoid of polarizability will have unequal axes, and its orientation will not, in general, be aligned with the crystal axes."
16465,So the polarization tensor must be the same after such a rotation.
16466,That can happen only if one of the axes of the ellipsoid is in the same direction as the symmetry axis of the crystal.
16467,"Otherwise, the orientation and dimensions of the ellipsoid are unrestricted."
16468,"If we go to a tetragonal crystal, the ellipse must have the same symmetry, so it must have two equal diameters."
16469,"Finally, for a cubic crystal, all three diameters of the ellipsoid must be equal; it becomes a sphere, and the polarizability of the crystal is the same in all directions."
16470,There is a big game of figuring out the possible kinds of tensors for all the possible symmetries of a crystal.
16471,It is called a “group-theoretical” analysis.
16472,"But for the simple case of the polarizability tensor, it is relatively easy to see what the relations must be."
16473,There are many other examples of tensors appearing in physics.
16474,Another example of a physical tensor is the moment of inertia.
16475,"For instance, a rectangular block will have different moments about each of its three orthogonal axes."
16476,"For rotations about one of the axes of symmetry, they are parallel."
16477,31–4).
16478,The tensor of inertia for a rigid body can be worked out if the shape of the object is known.
16479,We need only to write down the total kinetic energy of all the particles in the body.
16480,"Let’s assume that the body is rotating about its center of mass, which we take to be at rest."
16481,"For a body of any shape whatever, we can find the ellipsoid of inertia and, therefore, the three principal axes."
16482,"Referred to these axes, the tensor will be diagonal, so for any object there are always three orthogonal axes for which the angular velocity and angular momentum are parallel."
16483,They are called the principal axes of inertia.
16484,We should point out that we have been using tensors of the second rank since Chapter 20 of Volume I.
16485,"In four dimensions, for instance, an antisymmetric tensor of the second rank has up to six nonzero terms and certainly cannot be replaced by a vector with four components."
16486,"By luck, however, they are also representable by vectors (really pseudo vectors), so our mathematics has been made easier for us."
16487,(31.20) is indeed a tensor.
16488,Likewise Eq.
16489,"(31.22) is a tensor, since the two terms on the right-hand side are tensors."
16490,The symmetric tensors we have described so far arose as coefficients in relating one vector to another.
16491,We would like to look now at a tensor which has a different physical significance—the tensor of stress.
16492,Suppose we have a solid object with various forces on it.
16493,"We say that there are various “stresses” inside, by which we mean that there are internal forces between neighboring parts of the material."
16494,We have talked a little about such stresses in a two-dimensional case when we considered the surface tension in a stretched diaphragm in Section 12–3.
16495,We will now see that the internal forces in the material of a three-dimensional body can be described in terms of a tensor.
16496,Consider a body of some elastic material—say a block of jello.
16497,"If we make a cut through the block, the material on each side of the cut will, in general, get displaced by the internal forces."
16498,"Before the cut was made, there must have been forces between the two parts of the block that kept the material in place; we can define the stresses in terms of these forces."
16499,You are already familiar with one kind of stress—the pressure in a static liquid.
16500,There the force is equal to the pressure times the area and is at right angles to the surface element.
16501,For solids—also for viscous liquids in motion—the force need not be normal to the surface; there are shear forces in addition to pressures (positive or negative).
16502,(By a “shear” force we mean the tangential components of the force across a surface.)
16503,All three components of the force must be taken into account.
16504,"Notice also that if we make our cut on a plane with some other orientation, the forces will be different."
16505,A complete description of the internal stress requires a tensor.
16506,31–6.
16507,"Again we resolve this force into three components, as shown in Fig."
16508,Suppose we want to know the force across a surface oriented at some arbitrary angle.
16509,31–8.
16510,"(This is a somewhat special case, but will illustrate well enough the general method.)"
16511,Now the stress forces on the little solid triangle in Fig.
16512,"31–8 are in equilibrium (at least in the limit of infinitesimal dimensions), so the total force on it must be zero."
16513,"Our assumption that the surface forces on the small triangular volume are in equilibrium neglects any other body forces that might be present, such as gravity or pseudo forces if our coordinate system is not an inertial frame."
16514,"So if we take the scale of the little wedge small enough, the body forces can always be neglected in comparison with the surface forces."
16515,Let’s now add up the forces on the little wedge.
16516,"Suppose we take a little cube, oriented with its faces parallel to our coordinate axes, and look at it in cross section, as shown in Fig."
16517,31–9.
16518,"If the cube is small, the stresses do not change appreciably from one side of the cube to the opposite side, so the force components are equal and opposite as shown."
16519,"Now there must be no torque on the cube, or it would start spinning."
16520,"For surfaces normal to these axes, the stresses are particularly simple—they correspond to pushes or pulls perpendicular to the surfaces."
16521,There are no shear forces along these faces.
16522,"For any stress, we can always choose our axes so that the shear components are zero."
16523,"If the ellipsoid is a sphere, there are only normal forces in any direction."
16524,This corresponds to a hydrostatic pressure (positive or negative).
16525,So the stress tensor is a field.
16526,This introduces us to a new beast.
16527,It is a tensor of the fourth rank.
16528,(31.27).
16529,"This number is, of course, reduced for crystals of higher symmetry."
16530,"For example, a cubic crystal has only three elastic constants, and an isotropic substance has only two."
16531,That the latter is true can be seen as follows.
16532,We will leave it for you to show that a cubic crystal needs only three.
16533,"As a final example, this time of a third-rank tensor, we have the piezoelectric effect."
16534,All the tensors we have looked at so far in this chapter relate to the three dimensions of space; they are defined to have a certain transformation property under spatial rotations.
16535,The components of such a four-tensor transform under a Lorentz transformation of the coordinates in a special way that we worked out.
16536,"(Although we did not do it that way, we could have considered the Lorentz transformation as a “rotation” in a four-dimensional “space” called Minkowski space; then the analogy with what we are doing here would have been clearer.)"
16537,But a force is equal to the time rate of change of a momentum.
16538,We will now try to find the physical meaning of these extra components.
16539,We know that the space components represent flow of momentum.
16540,We can get a clue on how to extend this to the time dimension by studying another kind of “flow”—the flow of electric charge.
16541,We have seen that the time component of this flow vector is the density of the stuff that is flowing.
16542,"As an example, we will discuss this tensor not in matter, but in a region of free space in which there is an electromagnetic field."
16543,"That is to say, we must admit stress or, to put it less mysteriously, flow of momentum in the electromagnetic field."
16544,We discussed this in Chapter 27 in connection with Eq.
16545,"(27.21), but did not work out the details."
16546,"We want now to discuss the phenomenon of the refraction of light—and also, therefore, the absorption of light—by dense materials."
16547,"In Chapter 31 of Volume I we discussed the theory of the index of refraction, but because of our limited mathematical abilities at that time, we had to restrict ourselves to finding the index only for materials of low density, like gases."
16548,"The physical principles that produced the index were, however, made clear."
16549,"The electric field of the light wave polarizes the molecules of the gas, producing oscillating dipole moments."
16550,The acceleration of the oscillating charges radiates new waves of the field.
16551,"This new field, interfering with the old field, produces a changed field which is equivalent to a phase shift of the original wave."
16552,"Because this phase shift is proportional to the thickness of the material, the effect is equivalent to having a different phase velocity in the material."
16553,"When we looked at the subject before, we neglected the complications that arise from such effects as the new wave changing the fields at the oscillating dipoles."
16554,"We assumed that the forces on the charges in the atoms came just from the incoming wave, whereas, in fact, their oscillations are driven not only by the incoming wave but also by the radiated waves of all the other atoms."
16555,"It would have been difficult for us at that time to include this effect, so we studied only the rarefied gas, where such effects are not important."
16556,"Now, however, we will find that it is very easy to treat the problem by the use of differential equations."
16557,"This method obscures the physical origin of the index (as coming from the re-radiated waves interfering with the original waves), but it makes the theory for dense materials much simpler."
16558,This chapter will bring together a large number of pieces from our earlier work.
16559,"We’ve taken up practically everything we will need, so there are relatively few really new ideas to be introduced."
16560,"Since you may need to refresh your memory about what we are going to need, we give in Table 32–1 a list of the equations we are going to use, together with a reference to the place where each can be found."
16561,"In most instances, we will not take the time to give the physical arguments again, but will just use the equations."
16562,We begin by recalling the machinery of the index of refraction for a gas.
16563,We use a model of an atom or molecule in which the electron is bound with a force proportional to its displacement (as though the electron were held in place by a spring).
16564,"We emphasized that this was not a legitimate classical model of an atom, but we will show later that the correct quantum mechanical theory gives results equivalent to this model (in simple cases)."
16565,"In our earlier treatment, we did not include the possibility of a damping force in the atomic oscillators, but we will do so now."
16566,"Such a force corresponds to a resistance to the motion, that is, to a force proportional to the velocity of the electron."
16567,(We are assuming an isotropic oscillator whose restoring force is the same in all directions.
16568,This was the way we computed the index in Chapter 31 of Volume I.
16569,"Now, however, we want to take a different approach."
16570,The quantum mechanical solution for the motions of electrons in atoms gives a similar answer except with the following modifications.
16571,"However, at low frequencies there can be a strong response."
16572,"Also, the proportionality constant is a complex number, which means that the polarization does not exactly follow the electric field, but may be shifted in phase to some extent."
16573,"At any rate, there is a polarization per unit volume whose magnitude is proportional to the strength of the electric field."
16574,"The existence of polarization in matter means that there are polarization charges and currents inside of the material, and these must be put into the complete Maxwell equations in order to find the fields."
16575,"We are going to solve Maxwell’s equations this time in a situation in which the charges and currents are not zero, as in a vacuum, but are given implicitly by the polarization vector."
16576,Our problem is now direct and simple.
16577,(32.9) and (32.10).
16578,(We assume that there are no other currents and charges in the material.)
16579,"Before we do this, we would like to make an historical note."
16580,Maxwell originally wrote his equations in a form which was different from the one we have been using.
16581,Because the equations were written in this different form for many years—and are still written that way by many people—we will explain the difference.
16582,"In the early days, the mechanism of the dielectric constant was not fully and clearly appreciated."
16583,"The nature of atoms was not understood, nor that there was a polarization of the material."
16584,They thought only in terms of charges that were not bound to atoms (such as the charges that flow in wires or are rubbed off surfaces).
16585,Maxwell and the other early workers also had a problem with magnetic materials (which we will take up soon).
16586,"Because they did not know about the circulating currents responsible for atomic magnetism, they used a current density that was missing still another part."
16587,Instead of Eq.
16588,You will find the equations written this way in many places.
16589,So there used to be all kinds of cheating in solving the equations.
16590,We think the right way is to keep the equations in terms of the fundamental quantities as we now understand them—and that’s how we have done it.
16591,We want now to find out what kind of electromagnetic waves can exist in a dielectric material in which there are no extra charges other than those bound in atoms.
16592,We can solve these equations as we have done before.
16593,We start by taking the curl of Eq.
16594,(32.20) can still have wave solutions.
16595,The exponent of Eq.
16596,(32.20).
16597,The Laplacian in Eq.
16598,(32.8).
16599,(We’ll come back to discuss this assumption later.)
16600,"(32.24), will satisfy the field equations."
16601,Using Eq.
16602,"Let’s compare this formula with what we obtained in our theory of the index of a gas (Chapter 31, Vol."
16603,I).
16604,"There, we got Eq."
16605,"(32.6), Eq."
16606,Thus our new method gives for a gas the same result we found earlier.
16607,Now you might think that Eq.
16608,(32.27) should give the index of refraction for dense materials also.
16609,"It needs to be modified, however, for several reasons."
16610,We considered a similar problem when we studied the static fields in dielectrics.
16611,(See Chapter 11.)
16612,You will remember that we estimated the field at a single atom by imagining that it sat in a spherical hole in the surrounding dielectric.
16613,"(Remember, however, that this result is only strictly true in isotropic materials—including the special case of a cubic crystal.)"
16614,"The same arguments will hold for the electric field in a wave, so long as the wavelength of the wave is much longer than the spacing between atoms."
16615,"(32.3); that is, Eq."
16616,So we should correct Eq.
16617,This is known as the Clausius-Mossotti equation.
16618,There is another complication in dense materials.
16619,"Because neighboring atoms are so close, there are strong interactions between them."
16620,"The internal modes of oscillation are, therefore, modified."
16621,"The natural frequencies of the atomic oscillations are spread out by the interactions, and they are usually quite heavily damped—the resistance coefficient becomes quite large."
16622,(32.7).
16623,One final complication.
16624,"If the dense material is a mixture of several components, each will contribute to the polarization."
16625,"(32.28), in ordered crystals—effects we discussed when analyzing ferroelectrics]."
16626,(32.7).
16627,Equation (32.34) completes our theory of the index of refraction.
16628,It has been done from first principles only for a few especially simple substances.
16629,"We want to look now at the consequences of our result, Eq."
16630,(32.33).
16631,What does that mean?
16632,Our plane wave of Eq.
16633,The imaginary part of the index represents the attenuation of the wave due to the energy losses in the atomic oscillators.
16634,Thus we have in Eq.
16635,"(32.33) not only the theory of the index of refraction of materials, but the theory of their absorption of light as well."
16636,There is another prediction of our theory of the index of refraction that we can check against experiment.
16637,Suppose we consider a mixture of two materials.
16638,"The index of the mixture is not the average of the two indexes, but should be given in terms of the sum of the two polarizabilities, as in Eq."
16639,(32.34).
16640,"If we ask about the index of, say, a sugar solution, the total polarizability is the sum of the polarizability of the water and that of the sugar."
16641,We can use this formula to test our theory against experiment by measuring the index for various concentrations of sucrose in water.
16642,"We are making several assumptions here, however."
16643,Our formula assumes that there is no chemical action when the sucrose is dissolved and that the disturbances to the individual atomic oscillators are not too different for various concentrations.
16644,So our result is certainly only approximate.
16645,"Anyway, let’s see how good it is."
16646,We have picked the example of a sugar solution because there is a good table of measurements of the index of refraction in the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics and also because sugar is a molecular crystal that goes into solution without ionizing or otherwise changing its chemical state.
16647,We give in the first three columns of Table 32–2 the data from the handbook.
16648,For pure sugar we have taken the measured index of sugar crystals.
16649,"The crystals are not isotropic, so the measured index is different along different directions."
16650,"They are not exactly equal, but pretty close."
16651,We can conclude that our ideas are fairly correct.
16652,"Even more, we find that the polarizability of the sugar molecule doesn’t seem to depend much on its surroundings—its polarizability is nearly the same in a dilute solution as it is in the crystal."
16653,"The theory we have worked out in this chapter for solid materials can also be applied to good conductors, like metals, with very little modification."
16654,In metals some of the electrons have no binding force holding them to any particular atom; it is these “free” electrons which are responsible for the conductivity.
16655,"There are other electrons which are bound, and the theory above is directly applicable to them."
16656,"Their influence, however, is usually swamped by the effects of the conduction electrons."
16657,We will consider now only the effects of the free electrons.
16658,If there is no restoring force on an electron—but still some resistance to its motion—its equation of motion differs from Eq.
16659,"The reason that we had to distinguish between the average field and the local field in a dielectric is that in an insulator each of the dipoles is fixed in position, so that it has a definite relationship to the position of the others."
16660,So the correction we made to Eq.
16661,(32.8) by using Eq.
16662,(32.28) should not be made for conduction electrons.
16663,Therefore the formula for the index of refraction for metals should look like Eq.
16664,In Chapter 43 of Volume I we discussed how the conductivity of a metal comes from the diffusion of the free electrons through the crystal.
16665,"The electrons go on a jagged path from one scattering to the next, and between scatterings they move freely except for an acceleration due to any average electric field (as shown in Fig."
16666,32–2).
16667,"Since there is no average acceleration, the drag force is equal to the applied force."
16668,This is just what we expect from Eq.
16669,Using Eqs.
16670,"(32.40) and (32.41), we can rewrite our formula for the index, Eq."
16671,"Our result, Eq."
16672,"(32.42), for the index of refraction for metals predicts quite different characteristics for wave propagation at different frequencies."
16673,Let’s first see what happens at very low frequencies.
16674,Referring to Eq.
16675,32–3.
16676,Now what do we mean by “low” frequencies?
16677,Looking at Eq.
16678,"(32.42), we see that it can be approximated by Eq."
16679,Let’s see what frequencies these correspond to for a typical metal like copper.
16680,).
16681,"We can see from this why in studying cavities (or waveguides) we needed to worry only about the fields inside the cavity, and not in the metal or outside the cavity."
16682,"Also, we see why the losses in a cavity are reduced by a thin plating of silver or gold."
16683,"The losses come from the current, which are appreciable only in a thin layer equal to the skin depth."
16684,Suppose we look now at the index of a metal like copper at high frequencies.
16685,This is also evident from Eq.
16686,(32.50).
16687,(32.50) or Eq.
16688,"You know, of course, that metals are reasonably transparent to x-rays."
16689,But some metals are even transparent in the ultraviolet.
16690,In Table 32–3 we give for several metals the experimental observed wavelength at which they begin to become transparent.
16691,"Considering that the experimental wavelength is not too well defined, the fit of the theory is fairly good."
16692,The plasma frequency came up in Chapter 7 as the natural frequency of density oscillations of the free electrons.
16693,"(A clump of electrons is repelled by electric forces, and the inertia of the electrons leads to an oscillation of density.)"
16694,(It’s an interesting and not accidental coincidence.)
16695,"Although we have been talking about wave propagation in metals, you appreciate by this time the universality of the phenomena of physics—that it doesn’t make any difference whether the free electrons are in a metal or whether they are in the plasma of the ionosphere of the earth, or in the atmosphere of a star."
16696,"We can see now why long radio waves are absorbed or reflected by the ionosphere, whereas short waves go right through."
16697,(Short waves must be used for communication with satellites.)
16698,We have talked about the high- and low-frequency extremes for wave propagation in metals.
16699,For the in-between frequencies the full-blown formula of Eq.
16700,(32.42) must be used.
16701,"In general, the index will have real and imaginary parts; the wave is attenuated as it propagates into the metal."
16702,"For very thin layers, metals are somewhat transparent even at optical frequencies."
16703,"As an example, special goggles for people who work around high-temperature furnaces are made by evaporating a thin layer of gold on glass."
16704,The visible light is transmitted fairly well—with a strong green tinge—but the infrared is strongly absorbed.
16705,The subject of this chapter is the reflection and refraction of light—or electromagnetic waves in general—at surfaces.
16706,We have already discussed the laws of reflection and refraction in Chapters 26 and 33 of Volume I. Here’s what we found out there:
16707,"Our earlier discussion is really about as far as anyone would normally need to go with the subject, but we are going to do it all over again a different way."
16708,Why?
16709,One reason is that we assumed before that the indexes were real (no absorption in the materials).
16710,But another reason is that you should know how to deal with what happens to waves at surfaces from the point of view of Maxwell’s equations.
16711,"We’ll get the same answers as before, but now from a straightforward solution of the wave problem, rather than by some clever arguments."
16712,"We want to emphasize that the amplitude of a surface reflection is not a property of the material, as is the index of refraction."
16713,"It is a “surface property,” one that depends precisely on how the surface is made."
16714,(There are all kinds of possibilities of interference here—like the colors of oil films.
16715,Suitable thickness can even reduce the reflected amplitude to zero for a given frequency; that’s how coated lenses are made.)
16716,The formulas we will derive are correct only if the change of index is sudden—within a distance very small compared with one wavelength.
16717,Our equations will work for light for highly polished surfaces.
16718,"In general, if the index changes gradually over a distance of several wavelengths, there is very little reflection at all."
16719,"First, we remind you about the convenient way of describing a sinusoidal plane wave we used in Chapter 34 of Volume I."
16720,(See Fig.
16721,33–2.)
16722,So Eq.
16723,(33.6) is a convenient representation of a wave in any direction.
16724,"So the phase of a wave is an invariant, and Eq."
16725,You can see why it is very convenient to use the form in Eq.
16726,(33.6) when working with differential equations—differentiations are replaced by multiplications.
16727,You can remember the sign in Eq.
16728,Then you will understand the optics of an anisotropic crystal.
16729,Then you will know whether you are up to the level of a graduate student of 1890.
16730,"In this chapter, however, we will consider only isotropic substances."
16731,"We know from experience that when a plane wave arrives at the boundary between two different materials—say, air and glass, or water and oil—there is a wave reflected and a wave transmitted."
16732,Suppose we assume no more than that and see what we can work out.
16733,33–3.
16734,We will let it come out of the mathematical machinery.)
16735,We know that one of Maxwell’s equations gives Eq.
16736,All we have done so far is to describe the three waves; our problem now is to work out the parameters of the reflected and transmitted waves in terms of those of the incident wave.
16737,How can we do that?
16738,"The three waves we have described satisfy Maxwell’s equations in the uniform material, but Maxwell’s equations must also be satisfied at the boundary between the two different materials."
16739,So we must now look at what happens right at the boundary.
16740,We will find that Maxwell’s equations demand that the three waves fit together in a certain way.
16741,33–4.
16742,the flux through the area is zero.
16743,This gives us one relation among the fields of the three waves.
16744,"The procedure of working out the consequences of Maxwell’s equations at the boundary is called “determining the boundary conditions.” Ordinarily, it is done by finding as many equations like Eq."
16745,"33–4, or by using little Gaussian surfaces that straddle the boundary."
16746,"Although that is a perfectly good way of proceeding, it gives the impression that the problem of dealing with a boundary is different for every different physical problem."
16747,"For example, in a problem of heat flow across a boundary, how are the temperatures on the two sides related?"
16748,"Well, you could argue, for one thing, that the heat flow to the boundary from one side would have to equal the flow away from the other side."
16749,"It is usually possible, and generally quite useful, to work out the boundary conditions by making such physical arguments."
16750,"There may be times, however, when in working on some problem you have only some equations, and you may not see right away what physical arguments to use."
16751,"So although we are at the moment interested only in an electromagnetic problem, where we can make the physical arguments, we want to show you a method that can be used for any problem—a general way of finding what happens at a boundary directly from the differential equations."
16752,"Although we usually think of the boundary as being sharply discontinuous, in reality it is not."
16753,The physical properties change very rapidly but not infinitely fast.
16754,"In this region, the differential equations must still be satisfied, and it is by following the differential equations in this region that we can arrive at the needed “boundary conditions.”"
16755,"Between the vacuum and the glass there is a smooth, but rapid, transition."
16756,33–5(a).
16757,"Suppose now we take the first of our equations, Eq."
16758,(33.21).
16759,33–5(b).
16760,"If we imagine squashing the boundary to an even thinner layer, the spike would get much higher."
16761,Now how can Eq.
16762,(33.21) be satisfied if there is a whopping big spike on the right-hand side?
16763,Only if there is an equally whopping big spike on the other side.
16764,Something on the left-hand side must also be big.
16765,We can rewrite Eq.
16766,"We have, in this way, one of our boundary conditions."
16767,(33.26) is true in general.
16768,Let’s now go through the rest of Maxwell’s equations and see what each of them tells us.
16769,We take next Eq.
16770,(33.22a).
16771,"Next, we look at Eq."
16772,(33.22b).
16773,Ah!
16774,Suppose it has a huge derivative.
16775,But wait a moment!
16776,"[If it did, there would be a spike on the left of Eq."
16777,"(33.22b) but none on the right, and the equation would be false.]"
16778,(33.20) by a line integral argument.
16779,We go on to Eq.
16780,(33.23).
16781,On to the last of Maxwell’s equations!
16782,"We want to emphasize, however, that we get this result only when the materials on both sides of the boundary are nonmagnetic—or rather, when we can neglect any magnetic effects of the materials."
16783,"This can usually be done for most materials, except ferromagnetic ones."
16784,(We will treat the magnetic properties of materials in some later chapters.)
16785,We have put them all together in Table 33–1.
16786,We can now use them to match the waves in the two regions.
16787,"We want to emphasize, however, that the idea we have just used will work in any physical situation in which you have differential equations and you want a solution that crosses a sharp boundary between two regions where some property changes."
16788,"For our present purposes, we could have easily derived the same equations by using arguments about the fluxes and circulations at the boundary."
16789,(You might see whether you can get the same result that way.)
16790,But now you have seen a method that will work in case you ever get stuck and don’t see any easy argument about the physics of what is happening at the boundary—you can just work with the equations.
16791,Now we are ready to apply our boundary conditions to the waves we wrote down in Section 33–2.
16792,A wave of any other polarization is just a linear combination of two such waves.
16793,"In other words, the reflected and transmitted intensities are different for different polarizations, and it is easiest to pick the two simplest cases and treat them separately."
16794,We will carry through the analysis for an incoming wave polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence and then just give you the result for the other.
16795,"We are cheating a little by taking the simplest case, but the principle is the same for both."
16796,33–6.
16797,(We are cutting a corner here on our original plan of getting everything from the equations.
16798,"This result would also come out of the boundary conditions, but we can save a lot of algebra by using the physical argument."
16799,"When you have some spare time, see if you can get the same result from the equations."
16800,It is clear that what we have said agrees with the equations; it is just that we have not shown that there are no other possibilities.)
16801,"Now our boundary conditions, Eqs."
16802,Which one do we use?
16803,"(Since each satisfies Maxwell’s equations, so does the sum.)"
16804,"For the polarization we are considering, Eqs."
16805,(33.26) and (33.28) give us no new information; only Eq.
16806,(33.27) is useful.
16807,That can happen only if all the oscillations have the same frequency.
16808,(It is impossible for three—or any number—of such terms with different frequencies to add to zero for all times.)
16809,"We should really have saved ourselves some trouble by putting that in at the beginning, but we wanted to show you that it can also be got out of the equations."
16810,"When you are doing a real problem, it is usually the best thing to put everything you know into the works right at the start and save yourself a lot of trouble."
16811,Now look at Eq.
16812,"The positive sign makes no sense; that would not give a reflected wave, but another incident wave, and we said at the start that we were solving the problem of only one incident wave."
16813,(See Fig.
16814,33–3.)
16815,"If the indexes are not real, the wave numbers are complex, and we have to use Eq."
16816,(33.45).
16817,"(33.46), and Snell’s law, Eq."
16818,"(33.47), would be true in general."
16819,"But then the “angles” also are complex numbers, thereby losing their simple geometrical interpretation as angles."
16820,"So far, we haven’t found anything new."
16821,We have just had the simple-minded delight of getting some obvious answers from a complicated mathematical machinery.
16822,Now we are ready to find the amplitudes of the waves which we have not yet known.
16823,We must use another of the boundary conditions.
16824,Let’s try Eq.
16825,(33.48) all over again!
16826,We’ve just wasted time getting something we already knew.
16827,We could try Eq.
16828,So there’s only one equation left: Eq.
16829,(33.48).
16830,(33.45) or Eq.
16831,We will discuss the consequences of this result in the next section.
16832,33–7.
16833,The algebra is straightforward but more complicated.
16834,Let’s see whether our results agree with those we got earlier.
16835,Equation (33.3) is the result we worked out in Chapter 33 of Volume I for the ratio of the intensity of the reflected wave to the intensity of the incident wave.
16836,"Then, however, we were considering only real indexes."
16837,(33.3).
16838,"Similarly, Eq."
16839,(33.53) is the same as Eq.
16840,(33.4).
16841,"We can, however, go back to Eq."
16842,We can now use our results to understand the interesting phenomenon of reflection from metals.
16843,Why is it that metals are shiny?
16844,"We saw in the last chapter that metals have an index of refraction which, for some frequencies, has a large imaginary part."
16845,Then Eq.
16846,"In other words, the imaginary part of their indexes is very large."
16847,But we have seen that a large imaginary part of the index means a strong absorption.
16848,"So there is a general rule that if any material gets to be a very good absorber at any frequency, the waves are strongly reflected at the surface and very little gets inside to be absorbed."
16849,You can see this effect with strong dyes.
16850,Pure crystals of the strongest dyes have a “metallic” shine.
16851,"Probably you have noticed that at the edge of a bottle of purple ink the dried dye will give a golden metallic reflection, or that dried red ink will sometimes give a greenish metallic reflection."
16852,"Red ink absorbs out the greens of transmitted light, so if the ink is very concentrated, it will exhibit a strong surface reflection for the frequencies of green light."
16853,You can easily show this effect by coating a glass plate with red ink and letting it dry.
16854,"If you direct a beam of white light at the back of the plate, as shown in Fig."
16855,"33–8, there will be a transmitted beam of red light and a reflected beam of green light."
16856,You know that there is total internal reflection.
16857,But how does that come about?
16858,Let’s go back to Eq.
16859,You know by now what that means!
16860,The “transmitted” wave (Eq.
16861,"Clearly, what we want here is the negative sign."
16862,Then the amplitude of the wave to the right of the boundary will go as shown in Fig.
16863,33–9.
16864,"When light is totally reflected from the inside of a glass-air surface, there are fields in the air, but they extend beyond the surface only a distance of the order of the wavelength of the light."
16865,"We can now see how to answer the following question: If a light wave in glass arrives at the surface at a large enough angle, it is reflected; if another piece of glass is brought up to the surface (so that the “surface” in effect disappears) the light is transmitted."
16866,Exactly when does this happen?
16867,Surely there must be continuous change from total reflection to no reflection!
16868,"The answer, of course, is that if the air gap is so small that the exponential tail of the wave in the air has an appreciable strength at the second piece of glass, it will shake the electrons there and generate a new wave, as shown in Fig."
16869,33–10.
16870,Some light will be transmitted.
16871,"(Clearly, our solution is incomplete; we should solve all the equations again for a thin layer of air between two regions of glass.)"
16872,Then the exponentially decreasing field extends several centimeters.
16873,A microwave apparatus that shows the effect is drawn in Fig.
16874,33–11.
16875,33–11(a).
16876,"If a gap of a few centimeters is left between the two prisms, as in part (c), there are both transmitted and reflected waves."
16877,In this chapter we are going to talk about the magnetic properties of materials.
16878,"The material which has the most striking magnetic properties is, of course, iron."
16879,"That kind of magnetism, called ferromagnetism, is sufficiently striking and complicated that we will discuss it in a special chapter."
16880,"However, all ordinary substances do show some magnetic effects, although very small ones—a thousand to a million times less than the effects in ferromagnetic materials."
16881,"Here we are going to describe ordinary magnetism, that is to say, the magnetism of substances other than the ferromagnetic ones."
16882,This small magnetism is of two kinds.
16883,Some materials are attracted toward magnetic fields; others are repelled.
16884,"Unlike the electrical effect in matter, which always causes dielectrics to be attracted, there are two signs to the magnetic effect."
16885,"These two signs can be easily shown with the help of a strong electromagnet which has one sharply pointed pole piece and one flat pole piece, as drawn in Fig."
16886,34-1.
16887,The magnetic field is much stronger near the pointed pole than near the flat pole.
16888,"If a small piece of material is fastened to a long string and suspended between the poles, there will, in general, be a small force on it."
16889,This small force can be seen by the slight displacement of the hanging material when the magnet is turned on.
16890,The few ferromagnetic materials are attracted very strongly toward the pointed pole; all other materials feel only a very weak force.
16891,Some are weakly attracted to the pointed pole; and some are weakly repelled.
16892,"The effect is most easily seen with a small cylinder of bismuth, which is repelled from the high-field region."
16893,Substances which are repelled in this way are called diamagnetic.
16894,"Bismuth is one of the strongest diamagnetic materials, but even with it, the effect is still quite weak."
16895,Diamagnetism is always very weak.
16896,"If a small piece of aluminum is suspended between the poles, there is also a weak force, but toward the pointed pole."
16897,Substances like aluminum are called paramagnetic.
16898,"(In such an experiment, eddy-current forces arise when the magnet is turned on and off, and these can give off strong impulses."
16899,You must be careful to look for the net displacement after the hanging object settles down.)
16900,We want now to describe briefly the mechanisms of these two effects.
16901,"First, in many substances the atoms have no permanent magnetic moments, or rather, all the magnets within each atom balance out so that the net moment of the atom is zero."
16902,"The electron spins and orbital motions all exactly balance out, so that any particular atom has no average magnetic moment."
16903,"In these circumstances, when you turn on a magnetic field little extra currents are generated inside the atom by induction."
16904,"According to Lenz’s law, these currents are in such a direction as to oppose the increasing field."
16905,So the induced magnetic moments of the atoms are directed opposite to the magnetic field.
16906,This is the mechanism of diamagnetism.
16907,Then there are some substances for which the atoms do have a permanent magnetic moment—in which the electron spins and orbits have a net circulating current that is not zero.
16908,"So besides the diamagnetic effect (which is always present), there is also the possibility of lining up the individual atomic magnetic moments."
16909,"In this case, the moments try to line up with the magnetic field (in the way the permanent dipoles of a dielectric are lined up by the electric field), and the induced magnetism tends to enhance the magnetic field."
16910,These are the paramagnetic substances.
16911,Paramagnetism is generally fairly weak because the lining-up forces are relatively small compared with the forces from the thermal motions which try to derange the order.
16912,It also follows that paramagnetism is usually sensitive to the temperature.
16913,(The paramagnetism arising from the spins of the electrons responsible for conduction in a metal constitutes an exception.
16914,We will not be discussing this phenomenon here.)
16915,"For ordinary paramagnetism, the lower the temperature, the stronger the effect."
16916,There is more lining-up at low temperatures when the deranging effects of the collisions are less.
16917,"Diamagnetism, on the other hand, is more or less independent of the temperature."
16918,"In any substance with built-in magnetic moments there is a diamagnetic as well as a paramagnetic effect, but the paramagnetic effect usually dominates."
16919,"In Chapter 11 we described a ferroelectric material, in which all the electric dipoles get lined up by their own mutual electric fields."
16920,"It is also possible to imagine the magnetic analog of ferroelectricity, in which all the atomic moments would line up and lock together."
16921,"If you make calculations of how this should happen, you will find that because the magnetic forces are so much smaller than the electric forces, thermal motions should knock out this alignment even at temperatures as low as a few tenths of a degree Kelvin."
16922,So it would be impossible at room temperature to have any permanent lining up of the magnets.
16923,"On the other hand, this is exactly what does happen in iron—it does get lined up."
16924,"There is an effective force between the magnetic moments of the different atoms of iron which is much, much greater than the direct magnetic interaction."
16925,It is an indirect effect which can be explained only by quantum mechanics.
16926,"It is about ten thousand times stronger than the direct magnetic interaction, and is what lines up the moments in ferromagnetic materials."
16927,We discuss this special interaction in a later chapter.
16928,"Now that we have tried to give you a qualitative explanation of diamagnetism and paramagnetism, we must correct ourselves and say that it is not possible to understand the magnetic effects of materials in any honest way from the point of view of classical physics."
16929,Such magnetic effects are a completely quantum-mechanical phenomenon.
16930,"It is, however, possible to make some phoney classical arguments and to get some idea of what is going on."
16931,We might put it this way.
16932,"You can make some classical arguments and get guesses as to the behavior of the material, but these arguments are not “legal” in any sense because it is absolutely essential that quantum mechanics be involved in every one of these magnetic phenomena."
16933,"On the other hand, there are situations, such as in a plasma or a region of space with many free electrons, where the electrons do obey the laws of classical mechanics."
16934,"And in those circumstances, some of the theorems from classical magnetism are worthwhile."
16935,"Also, the classical arguments are of some value for historical reasons."
16936,"The first few times that people were able to guess at the meaning and behavior of magnetic materials, they used classical arguments."
16937,"Finally, as we have already illustrated, classical mechanics can give us some useful guesses as to what might happen—even though the really honest way to study this subject would be to learn quantum mechanics first and then to understand the magnetism in terms of quantum mechanics."
16938,"On the other hand, we don’t want to wait until we learn quantum mechanics inside out to understand a simple thing like diamagnetism."
16939,"We will have to lean on the classical mechanics as kind of half showing what happens, realizing, however, that the arguments are really not correct."
16940,We therefore make a series of theorems about classical magnetism that will confuse you because they will prove different things.
16941,"Except for the last theorem, every one of them will be wrong."
16942,"Furthermore, they will all be wrong as a description of the physical world, because quantum mechanics is left out."
16943,"The first theorem we want to prove from classical mechanics is the following: If an electron is moving in a circular orbit (for example, revolving around a nucleus under the influence of a central force), there is a definite ratio between the magnetic moment and the angular momentum."
16944,The magnitude of the angular momentum is the mass of the electron times the velocity times the radius.
16945,(See Fig.
16946,34-2.)
16947,It is directed perpendicular to the plane of the orbit.
16948,The magnetic moment of the same orbit is the current times the area.
16949,(See Section 14-5.)
16950,"That’s what we would expect classically and, miraculously enough, it is also true quantum-mechanically."
16951,It’s one of those things.
16952,"However, if you keep going with the classical physics, you find other places where it gives the wrong answers, and it is a great game to try to remember which things are right and which things are wrong."
16953,We might as well give you immediately what is true in general in quantum mechanics.
16954,"First, Eq."
16955,"(34.4) is true for orbital motion, but that’s not the only magnetism that exists."
16956,"The electron also has a spin rotation about its own axis (something like the earth rotating on its axis), and as a result of that spin it has both an angular momentum and a magnetic moment."
16957,"In any atom there are, generally speaking, several electrons and some combination of spin and orbit rotations which builds up a total angular momentum and a total magnetic moment."
16958,"Although there is no classical reason why it should be so, it is always true in quantum mechanics that (for an isolated atom) the direction of the magnetic moment is exactly opposite to the direction of the angular momentum."
16959,"This formula does not, of course, tell us very much."
16960,"It says that the magnetic moment is parallel to the angular momentum, but can have any magnitude."
16961,The form of Eq.
16962,You might also be interested in what happens in nuclei.
16963,"In nuclei there are protons and neutrons which may move around in some kind of orbit and at the same time, like an electron, have an intrinsic spin."
16964,Again the magnetic moment is parallel to the angular momentum.
16965,(34.3) equal to the proton mass.
16966,"The neutron, in other words, is not exactly “neutral” in the magnetic sense."
16967,"It is like a little magnet, and it has the kind of magnetic moment that a rotating negative charge would have."
16968,One of the consequences of having the magnetic moment proportional to the angular momentum is that an atomic magnet placed in a magnetic field will precess.
16969,First we will argue classically.
16970,Therefore the torque due to the magnetic field will not cause the magnet to line up.
16971,"Instead, the magnet will precess, as we saw when we analyzed a gyroscope in Chapter 20 of Volume I."
16972,The angular momentum—and with it the magnetic moment—precesses about an axis parallel to the magnetic field.
16973,We can find the rate of precession by the same method we used in Chapter 20 of the first volume.
16974,"According to the classical theory, then, the electron orbits—and spins—in an atom should precess in a magnetic field."
16975,Is it also true quantum-mechanically?
16976,"It is essentially true, but the meaning of the “precession” is different."
16977,"In quantum mechanics one cannot talk about the direction of the angular momentum in the same sense as one does classically; nevertheless, there is a very close analogy—so close that we continue to call it “precession.” We will discuss it later when we talk about the quantum-mechanical point of view."
16978,Next we want to look at diamagnetism from the classical point of view.
16979,"It can be worked out in several ways, but one of the nice ways is the following."
16980,Suppose that we slowly turn on a magnetic field in the vicinity of an atom.
16981,As the magnetic field changes an electric field is generated by magnetic induction.
16982,34-4.
16983,We would like to write Eq.
16984,(34.16) a little differently.
16985,It is therefore usually more convenient to write Eq.
16986,This is diamagnetism of matter.
16987,It is this magnetic effect that is responsible for the small force on a piece of bismuth in a nonuniform magnetic field.
16988,(You could compute the force by working out the energy of the induced moments in the field and seeing how the energy changes as the material is moved into or out of the high-field region.)
16989,Classical mechanics cannot supply an answer.
16990,We must go back and start over with quantum mechanics.
16991,"In an atom we cannot really say where an electron is, but only know the probability that it will be at some place."
16992,"This equation, of course, is the moment for one electron."
16993,The total moment is given by the sum over all the electrons in the atom.
16994,"The surprising thing is that the classical argument and quantum mechanics give the same answer, although, as we shall see, the classical argument that gives Eq."
16995,(34.17) is not really valid in classical mechanics.
16996,The same diamagnetic effect occurs even when an atom already has a permanent moment.
16997,Then the system will precess in the magnetic field.
16998,"As the whole atom precesses, it takes up an additional small angular velocity, and that slow turning gives a small current which represents a correction to the magnetic moment."
16999,This is just the diamagnetic effect represented in another way.
17000,But we don’t really have to worry about that when we talk about paramagnetism.
17001,"If the diamagnetic effect is first computed, as we have done here, we don’t have to worry about the fact that there is an extra little current from the precession."
17002,That has already been included in the diamagnetic term.
17003,We can already conclude something from our results so far.
17004,"Thus, according to the classical theory, all systems of electrons would precess with the same angular velocity."
17005,(This is not true in quantum mechanics.)
17006,This result is related to a theorem in classical mechanics that we would now like to prove.
17007,Suppose we have a group of electrons which are all held together by attraction toward a central point—as the electrons are attracted by a nucleus.
17008,"The electrons will also be interacting with each other, and can, in general, have complicated motions."
17009,Suppose you have solved for the motions with no magnetic field and then want to know what the motions would be with a weak magnetic field.
17010,"There are, of course, many possible motions."
17011,"The point is that for every motion without the magnetic field there is a corresponding motion in the field, which is the original motion plus a uniform rotation."
17012,"We would like to show how the theorem can be proved, but we will let you work out the details."
17013,"Take, first, one electron in a central force field."
17014,"This is no longer an inertial system, so we have to put in the proper pseudo forces—the centrifugal and Coriolis forces we talked about in Chapter 19 of Volume I."
17015,(34.20) in comparison with the second (Coriolis).
17016,Then Eqs.
17017,(34.21) to that in Eq.
17018,(34.18).
17019,(34.21) to get the last term].
17020,"The motion of the electron is just the same as with no magnetic field—and, of course, no rotation."
17021,We have proved Larmor’s theorem for one electron.
17022,"The only thing we could ask you to improve on is to take the case of many electrons mutually interacting with each other, but all in the same central field, and prove the same theorem."
17023,"So no matter how complex an atom is, if it has a central field the theorem is true."
17024,"But that’s the end of the classical mechanics, because it isn’t true in fact that the motions precess in that way."
17025,Now we would like to demonstrate that according to classical mechanics there can be no diamagnetism and no paramagnetism at all.
17026,"It sounds crazy—first, we have proved that there are paramagnetism, diamagnetism, precessing orbits, and so on, and now we are going to prove that it is all wrong."
17027,"Yes!—We are going to prove that if you follow the classical mechanics far enough, there are no such magnetic effects—they all cancel out."
17028,"If you start a classical argument in a certain place and don’t go far enough, you can get any answer you want."
17029,But the only legitimate and correct proof shows that there is no magnetic effect whatever.
17030,"It is a consequence of classical mechanics that if you have any kind of system—a gas with electrons, protons, and whatever—kept in a box so that the whole thing can’t turn, there will be no magnetic effect."
17031,"It is possible to have a magnetic effect if you have an isolated system, like a star held together by itself, which can start rotating when you put on the magnetic field."
17032,"But if you have a piece of material that is held in place so that it can’t start spinning, then there will be no magnetic effects."
17033,What we mean by holding down the spin is summarized this way: At a given temperature we suppose that there is only one state of thermal equilibrium.
17034,"The theorem then says that if you turn on a magnetic field and wait for the system to get into thermal equilibrium, there will be no paramagnetism or diamagnetism—there will be no induced magnetic moment."
17035,Now what is the energy of motion?
17036,"So the energy of a system, whether it is in a magnetic field or not, is always given by the kinetic energy plus the potential energy."
17037,"Since the probability of any motion depends only on the energy—that is, on the velocity and position—it is the same whether or not there is a magnetic field."
17038,"For thermal equilibrium, therefore, the magnetic field has no effect."
17039,"If we have one system in a box, and then have another system in a second box, this time with a magnetic field, the probability of any particular velocity at any point in the first box is the same as in the second."
17040,"If the first box has no average circulating current (which it will not have if it is in equilibrium with the stationary walls), there is no average magnetic moment."
17041,"Since in the second box all the motions are the same, there is no average magnetic moment there either."
17042,"Hence, if the temperature is kept constant and thermal equilibrium is re-established after the field is turned on, there can be no magnetic moment induced by the field—according to classical mechanics."
17043,We can only get a satisfactory understanding of magnetic phenomena from quantum mechanics.
17044,"Unfortunately, we cannot assume that you have a thorough understanding of quantum mechanics, so this is hardly the place to discuss the matter."
17045,"On the other hand, we don’t always have to learn something first by learning the exact rules and then by learning how they are applied in different cases."
17046,Almost every subject that we have taken up in this course has been treated in a different way.
17047,"In the case of electricity, we wrote the Maxwell equations on “Page One” and then deduced all the consequences."
17048,That’s one way.
17049,"But we will not now try to begin a new “Page One,” writing the equations of quantum mechanics and deducing everything from them."
17050,"We will just have to tell you some of the consequences of quantum mechanics, before you learn where they come from."
17051,So here we go.
17052,We have already given you a relation between the magnetic moment and the angular momentum.
17053,That’s pleasant.
17054,But what do the magnetic moment and the angular momentum mean in quantum mechanics?
17055,"In quantum mechanics it turns out to be best to define things like magnetic moments in terms of the other concepts such as energy, in order to make sure that one knows what it means."
17056,"Therefore, the following definition has been taken in quantum mechanics: If we calculate the energy of a system in a magnetic field and we find that it is proportional to the field strength (for small field), the coefficient is called the component of magnetic moment in the direction of the field."
17057,"(We don’t have to get so elegant for our work now; we can still think of the magnetic moment in the ordinary, to some extent classical, sense.)"
17058,"Now we would like to discuss the idea of angular momentum in quantum mechanics—or rather, the characteristics of what, in quantum mechanics, is called angular momentum."
17059,"You see, when you go to new kinds of laws, you can’t just assume that each word is going to mean exactly the same thing."
17060,"You may think, say, “Oh, I know what angular momentum is."
17061,It’s that thing that is changed by a torque.” But what’s a torque?
17062,In quantum mechanics we have to have new definitions of old quantities.
17063,"It would, therefore, be legally best to call it by some other name such as “quantangular momentum,” or something like that, because it is the angular momentum as defined in quantum mechanics."
17064,"But if we can find a quantity in quantum mechanics which is identical to our old idea of angular momentum when the system becomes large enough, there is no use in inventing an extra word."
17065,We might as well just call it angular momentum.
17066,"With that understanding, this odd thing that we are about to describe is angular momentum."
17067,It is the thing which in a large system we recognize as angular momentum in classical mechanics.
17068,"First, we take a system in which angular momentum is conserved, such as an atom all by itself in empty space."
17069,"Now such a thing (like the earth spinning on its axis) could, in the ordinary sense, be spinning around any axis one wished to choose."
17070,"And for a given spin, there could be many different “states,” all of the same energy, each “state” corresponding to a particular direction of the axis of the angular momentum."
17071,"So in the classical theory, with a given angular momentum, there is an infinite number of possible states, all of the same energy."
17072,"It turns out in quantum mechanics, however, that several strange things happen."
17073,"First, the number of states in which such a system can exist is limited—there is only a finite number."
17074,"If the system is small, the finite number is very small, and if the system is large, the finite number gets very, very large."
17075,But that is not so.
17076,"Although it is quite mysterious, we ask you just to accept it for the moment."
17077,We will come back and discuss the point later.
17078,No!
17079,We would like to add one other fact.
17080,"All of the states are in fact single states, and each is just as good as any other."
17081,Each one has the same “weight” in the world.
17082,(We are assuming that nothing has been done to sort out a special sample.)
17083,"This fact has, incidentally, a simple classical analog."
17084,(You can easily work that out.)
17085,"From what we have so far, we can get another interesting and somewhat surprising conclusion."
17086,"This rule is commonly used, and usually gives the correct result, but not always."
17087,We can give the following argument to show why you might expect this rule to work.
17088,(There is no special distinction for any one of the directions.)
17089,"(34.25), together with Eq."
17090,Now we want to talk again about the magnetic moment.
17091,We have said that in quantum mechanics the magnetic moment of a particular atomic system can be written in terms of the angular momentum by Eq.
17092,An atomic magnet placed in an external magnetic field will have an extra magnetic energy which depends on the component of its magnetic moment along the field direction.
17093,"Therefore, the magnetic energy of an atomic system is not arbitrary; it can have only certain values."
17094,We can show these energies by an energy-level diagram like that drawn in Fig.
17095,34-5.
17096,That is what quantum mechanics says about the behavior of an atomic system in a magnetic field.
17097,The simplest “atomic” system is a single electron.
17098,The possible energies in a magnetic field are shown in Fig.
17099,34-6.
17100,Speaking loosely we say that the electron either has its spin “up” (along the field) or “down” (opposite the field).
17101,"For systems with higher spins, there are more states."
17102,We will use these quantum mechanical results to discuss the magnetic properties of materials in the next chapter.
17103,"In the last chapter we described how in quantum mechanics the angular momentum of a thing does not have an arbitrary direction, but its component along a given axis can take on only certain equally spaced, discrete values."
17104,It is a shocking and peculiar thing.
17105,You may think that perhaps we should not go into such things until your minds are more advanced and ready to accept this kind of an idea.
17106,"Actually, your minds will never become more advanced—in the sense of being able to accept such a thing easily."
17107,There isn’t any descriptive way of making it intelligible that isn’t so subtle and advanced in its own form that it is more complicated than the thing you were trying to explain.
17108,The behavior of matter on a small scale—as we have remarked many times—is different from anything that you are used to and is very strange indeed.
17109,"As we proceed with classical physics, it is a good idea to try to get a growing acquaintance with the behavior of things on a small scale, at first as a kind of experience without any deep understanding."
17110,"Understanding of these matters comes very slowly, if at all."
17111,"Of course, one does get better able to know what is going to happen in a quantum-mechanical situation—if that is what understanding means—but one never gets a comfortable feeling that these quantum-mechanical rules are “natural.” Of course they are, but they are not natural to our own experience at an ordinary level."
17112,We should explain that the attitude that we are going to take with regard to this rule about angular momentum is quite different from many of the other things we have talked about.
17113,"We are not going to try to “explain” it, but we must at least tell you what happens; it would be dishonest to describe the magnetic properties of materials without mentioning the fact that the classical description of magnetism—of angular momentum and magnetic moments—is incorrect."
17114,This is so no matter which axis you take.
17115,"The subtleties involved in that curious fact—that you can take any other axis and find that the component for it is also locked to the same set of values—we will leave to a later chapter, when you will experience the delight of seeing how this apparent paradox is ultimately resolved."
17116,We have also mentioned that every simple atomic system has a magnetic moment which has the same direction as the angular momentum.
17117,This is true not only for atoms and nuclei but also for the fundamental particles.
17118,"(For some particles, both are zero.)"
17119,"We must have the condition that the field should not be too great, otherwise it could disturb the internal motions of the system and the energy would not be a measure of the magnetic moment that was there before the field was turned on."
17120,(35.1).
17121,"But the moment we turn on the magnetic field, there is an additional energy of interaction which separates these states into four slightly different energy levels."
17122,35-1.
17123,(Remember that for any arrangement of electrons the magnetic moment is always directed opposite to the angular momentum.)
17124,You will notice from the diagrams that the “center of gravity” of the energy levels is the same with and without a magnetic field.
17125,Also notice that the spacings from one level to the next are always equal for a given particle in a given magnetic field.
17126,Using Eqs.
17127,The fact that the angular momentum is quantized is such a surprising thing that we will talk a little bit about it historically.
17128,It was a shock from the moment it was discovered (although it was expected theoretically).
17129,It was first observed in an experiment done in 1922 by Stern and Gerlach.
17130,"If you wish, you can consider the experiment of Stern-Gerlach as a direct justification for a belief in the quantization of angular momentum."
17131,Stern and Gerlach devised an experiment for measuring the magnetic moment of individual silver atoms.
17132,They produced a beam of silver atoms by evaporating silver in a hot oven and letting some of them come out through a series of small holes.
17133,"This beam was directed between the pole tips of a special magnet, as shown in Fig."
17134,35-2.
17135,Their idea was the following.
17136,Stern and Gerlach made their magnet with a very sharp edge on one of the pole tips in order to produce a very rapid variation of the magnetic field.
17137,"The beam of silver atoms was directed right along this sharp edge, so that the atoms would feel a vertical force in the inhomogeneous field."
17138,A silver atom with its magnetic moment directed horizontally would have no force on it and would go straight past the magnet.
17139,An atom whose magnetic moment was exactly vertical would have a force pulling it up toward the sharp edge of the magnet.
17140,An atom whose magnetic moment was pointed downward would feel a downward push.
17141,"Thus, as they left the magnet, the atoms would be spread out according to their vertical components of magnetic moment."
17142,"In the classical theory all angles are possible, so that when the silver atoms are collected by deposition on a glass plate, one should expect a smear of silver along a vertical line."
17143,The height of the line would be proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic moment.
17144,The abject failure of classical ideas was completely revealed when Stern and Gerlach saw what actually happened.
17145,They found on the glass plate two distinct spots.
17146,The silver atoms had formed two beams.
17147,That a beam of atoms whose spins would apparently be randomly oriented gets split up into two separate beams is most miraculous.
17148,How does the magnetic moment know that it is only allowed to take on certain components in the direction of the magnetic field?
17149,"Well, that was really the beginning of the discovery of the quantization of angular momentum, and instead of trying to give you a theoretical explanation, we will just say that you are stuck with the result of this experiment just as the physicists of that day had to accept the result when the experiment was done."
17150,It is an experimental fact that the energy of an atom in a magnetic field takes on a series of individual values.
17151,For each of these values the energy is proportional to the field strength.
17152,"So in a region where the field varies, the principle of virtual work tells us that the possible magnetic force on the atoms will have a set of separate values; the force is different for each state, so the beam of atoms is split into a small number of separate beams."
17153,"From a measurement of the deflection of the beams, one can find the strength of the magnetic moment."
17154,We would now like to describe an improved apparatus for the measurement of magnetic moments which was developed by I. I. Rabi and his collaborators.
17155,"In the Stern-Gerlach experiment the deflection of atoms is very small, and the measurement of the magnetic moment is not very precise."
17156,Rabi’s technique permits a fantastic precision in the measurement of the magnetic moments.
17157,The method is based on the fact that the original energy of the atoms in a magnetic field is split up into a finite number of energy levels.
17158,That the energy of an atom in the magnetic field can have only certain discrete energies is really not more surprising than the fact that atoms in general have only certain discrete energy levels—something we mentioned often in Volume I.
17159,Why should the same thing not hold for atoms in a magnetic field?
17160,It does.
17161,But it is the attempt to correlate this with the idea of an oriented magnetic moment that brings out some of the strange implications of quantum mechanics.
17162,"Only then, the energy differences are so small that the frequency does not correspond to light, but to microwaves or to radiofrequencies."
17163,"The transitions from the lower energy level to an upper energy level of an atom can also take place with the absorption of light or, in the case of atoms in a magnetic field, by the absorption of microwave energy."
17164,"Thus if we have an atom in a magnetic field, we can cause transitions from one state to another by applying an additional electromagnetic field of the proper frequency."
17165,(35.7).
17166,(35.4).
17167,"If the atom is tickled with the wrong frequency, the chance of causing a transition is very small."
17168,It is interesting that one comes to the same conclusion from a classical point of view.
17169,(See Fig.
17170,35-3.)
17171,The magnetic field produces a torque around a horizontal axis.
17172,"Such a torque you would think is trying to line up the magnet with the field, but it only causes the precession."
17173,In Fig.
17174,"For our precessing atom in a uniform magnetic field, how can we apply the kind of torque we want?"
17175,The answer is: with a weak magnetic field from the side.
17176,35-4(a).
17177,"Such a field works very well, but an alternating horizontal field is almost as good."
17178,It must jump suddenly from one value to another.
17179,We have made the comparison between the consequences of classical mechanics and quantum mechanics to give you some clue as to what might happen classically and how it is related to what actually happens in quantum mechanics.
17180,"You will notice, incidentally, that the expected resonant frequency is the same in both cases."
17181,"It happens that there isn’t any analog of this in the classical case, and also it doesn’t happen in the quantum theory either—at least not for the particular method of inducing the transitions that we have described."
17182,Now we are ready to describe Rabi’s method for measuring magnetic moments.
17183,A diagram of the apparatus is shown in Fig.
17184,35-5.
17185,There is an oven which gives out a stream of neutral atoms which passes down a line of three magnets.
17186,Atoms which start out from the oven along other paths will not get through the slit.
17187,"The detector may be made in various ways, depending on the atom being measured."
17188,"For example, for atoms of an alkali metal like sodium, the detector can be a thin, hot tungsten wire connected to a sensitive current meter."
17189,There is a current from the wire proportional to the number of sodium atoms arriving per second.
17190,35-5.
17191,35-6.
17192,"Such atomic-beam or, as they are usually called, “molecular” beam resonance experiments are a beautiful and delicate way of measuring the magnetic properties of atomic objects."
17193,We would like now to describe the phenomenon of the paramagnetism of bulk materials.
17194,"Suppose we have a substance whose atoms have permanent magnetic moments, for example a crystal like copper sulfate."
17195,In the crystal there are copper ions whose inner electron shells have a net angular momentum and a net magnetic moment.
17196,So the copper ion is an object which has a permanent magnetic moment.
17197,Let’s say just a word about which atoms have magnetic moments and which ones don’t.
17198,"Any atom, like sodium for instance, which has an odd number of electrons, will have a magnetic moment."
17199,Sodium has one electron in its unfilled shell.
17200,This electron gives the atom a spin and a magnetic moment.
17201,"Ordinarily, however, when compounds are formed the extra electrons in the outside shell are coupled together with other electrons whose spin directions are exactly opposite, so that all the angular momenta and magnetic moments of the valence electrons usually cancel out."
17202,"That’s why, in general, molecules do not have a magnetic moment."
17203,"Of course if you have a gas of sodium atoms, there is no such cancellation.1  Also, if you have what is called in chemistry a “free radical”—an object with an odd number of valence electrons—then the bonds are not completely satisfied, and there is a net angular momentum."
17204,In most bulk materials there is a net magnetic moment only if there are atoms present whose inner electron shell is not filled.
17205,Then there can be a net angular momentum and a magnetic moment.
17206,"Such atoms are found in the “transition element” part of the periodic table—for instance, chromium, manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, palladium, and platinum are elements of this kind."
17207,"Also, all of the rare earth elements have unfilled inner shells and permanent magnetic moments."
17208,"There are a couple of other strange things that also happen to have magnetic moments, such as liquid oxygen, but we will leave it to the chemistry department to explain the reason."
17209,"Now suppose that we have a box full of atoms or molecules with permanent moments—say a gas, or a liquid, or a crystal."
17210,We would like to know what happens if we apply an external magnetic field.
17211,"With no magnetic field, the atoms are kicked around by the thermal motions, and the moments wind up pointing in all directions."
17212,"But when there is a magnetic field, it acts to line up the little magnets; then there are more moments lying toward the field than away from it."
17213,The material is “magnetized.”
17214,The classical theory of paramagnetism is just like the theory of the dielectric constant we showed you in Chapter 11.
17215,(11.20).]
17216,We find that the induced magnetization—the magnetic moment per unit volume—is proportional to the magnetic field.
17217,This is the phenomenon of paramagnetism.
17218,You will see that the effect is stronger at lower temperatures and weaker at higher temperatures.
17219,"When we put a field on a substance, it develops, for small fields, a magnetic moment proportional to the field."
17220,Now we want to look at paramagnetism from the point of view of quantum mechanics.
17221,Using Eqs.
17222,35-7.
17223,"So at high fields, the magnetization saturates."
17224,We can see why that is; at high enough fields the moments are all lined up in the same direction.
17225,One must go to very low temperatures to see the saturation.
17226,(35.9).
17227,"(35.9), does indeed reproduce the correct quantum formula, Eq."
17228,(35.22).
17229,Most atoms have moments of roughly this size.
17230,It is called the Bohr magneton.
17231,The spin magnetic moment of the electron is almost exactly one Bohr magneton.
17232,There is a very interesting special application of paramagnetism.
17233,At very low temperatures it is possible to line up the atomic magnets in a strong field.
17234,It is then possible to get down to extremely low temperatures by a process called adiabatic demagnetization.
17235,"We can take a paramagnetic salt (for example, one containing a number of rare-earth atoms like praseodymium-ammonium-nitrate), and start by cooling it down with liquid helium to one or two degrees absolute in a strong magnetic field."
17236,"Most of the spins are lined up, and the magnetization is nearly saturated."
17237,"Let’s say, to make it easy, that the field is very powerful and the temperature is very low, so that nearly all the atoms are lined up."
17238,"Then you isolate the salt thermally (say, by removing the liquid helium and leaving a good vacuum) and turn off the magnetic field."
17239,The temperature of the salt goes way down.
17240,"Now if you were to turn off the field suddenly, the jiggling and shaking of the atoms in the crystal lattice would gradually knock all the spins out of alignment."
17241,Some of them would be up and some down.
17242,"But if there is no field (and disregarding the interactions between the atomic magnets, which will make only a slight error), it takes no energy to turn over the atomic magnets."
17243,"They could randomize their spins without any energy change and, therefore, without any temperature change."
17244,"Suppose, however, that while the atomic magnets are being flipped over by the thermal motion there is still some magnetic field present."
17245,Then it requires some work to flip them over opposite to the field—they must do work against the field.
17246,This takes energy from the thermal motions and lowers the temperature.
17247,"So if the strong magnetic field is not removed too rapidly, the temperature of the salt will decrease—it is cooled by the demagnetization."
17248,"From the quantum-mechanical view, when the field is strong all the atoms are in the lowest state, because the odds against any being in the upper state are impossibly big."
17249,"But as the field is lowered, it gets more and more likely that thermal fluctuations will knock an atom into the upper state."
17250,"So if the field is turned off slowly, the magnetic transitions can take energy out of the thermal vibrations of the crystal, cooling it off."
17251,It is possible in this way to go from a temperature of a few degrees absolute down to a temperature of a few thousandths of a degree.
17252,Would you like to make something even colder than that?
17253,It turns out that Nature has provided a way.
17254,We have already mentioned that there are also magnetic moments for the atomic nuclei.
17255,"Our formulas for paramagnetism work just as well for nuclei, except that the moments of nuclei are roughly a thousand times smaller."
17256,"That is good luck, because we can then use the adiabatic demagnetization of the nuclear magnetism to reach still lower temperatures."
17257,Thus it is possible to do two stages of magnetic cooling.
17258,First we use adiabatic demagnetization of paramagnetic ions to reach a few thousandths of a degree.
17259,Then we use the cold paramagnetic salt to cool some material which has a strong nuclear magnetism.
17260,"Finally, when we remove the magnetic field from this material, its temperature will go down to within a millionth of a degree of absolute zero—if we have done everything very carefully."
17261,We have said that atomic paramagnetism is very small and that nuclear magnetism is even a thousand times smaller.
17262,"Yet it is relatively easy to observe the nuclear magnetism by the phenomenon of “nuclear magnetic resonance.” Suppose we take a substance like water, in which all of the electron spins are exactly balanced so that their net magnetic moment is zero."
17263,"The molecules will still have a very, very tiny magnetic moment due to the nuclear magnetic moment of the hydrogen nuclei."
17264,"If the water is in thermal equilibrium, there will be slightly more protons in the lower energy states—with their moments directed parallel to the field."
17265,There is a small net magnetic moment per unit volume.
17266,(35.22)—is only about one-millionth as strong as typical atomic paramagnetism.
17267,(That’s why we have to pick a material with no atomic magnetism.)
17268,"It can still be observed, however, in the following way."
17269,Suppose we surround the water sample with a small coil that produces a small horizontal oscillating magnetic field.
17270,"Since there are slightly more protons in the lower state than in the upper one, there will be a net absorption of energy from the coil."
17271,"Although the effect is very small, the slight energy absorption can be seen with a sensitive electronic amplifier."
17272,A typical nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus is shown in Fig.
17273,35-8.
17274,A high-frequency oscillator drives a small coil placed between the poles of a large electromagnet.
17275,The circuit of the oscillator is arranged to give an additional output signal proportional to any change in the power being absorbed from the oscillator.
17276,This signal is fed to the vertical deflection amplifier of an oscilloscope.
17277,The horizontal sweep of the oscilloscope is triggered once during each cycle of the field-wobbling frequency.
17278,"(More usually, the horizontal deflection is made to follow in proportion to the wobbling field.)"
17279,"Before the water sample is placed inside the high-frequency coil, the power drawn from the oscillator is some value."
17280,(It doesn’t change with the magnetic field.)
17281,"When a small bottle of water is placed in the coil, however, a signal appears on the oscilloscope, as shown in the figure."
17282,We see a picture of the power being absorbed by the flipping over of the protons!
17283,What one does is to adjust the main magnet current until the resonance signal appears on the oscilloscope.
17284,It turns out that this is now the most convenient way to make an accurate measurement of the strength of a magnetic field.
17285,"But now that this has been done, a proton resonance apparatus like that of the figure can be used as a “proton resonance magnetometer.”"
17286,We should say a word about the shape of the signal.
17287,"If we were to wobble the magnetic field very slowly, we would expect to see a normal resonance curve."
17288,There would be some absorption at nearby frequencies because all the protons are not in exactly the same field—and different fields mean slightly different resonant frequencies.
17289,"One might wonder, incidentally, whether at the resonance frequency we should see any signal at all."
17290,Shouldn’t we expect the high-frequency field to equalize the populations of the two states—so that there should be no signal except when the water is first put in?
17291,"If we sit at the resonance, the power being absorbed by the nuclei is just what is being lost to the thermal motions."
17292,"There is, however, relatively little “thermal contact” between the proton magnetic moments and the atomic motions."
17293,The protons are relatively isolated down in the center of the electron distributions.
17294,"So in pure water, the resonance signal is, in fact, usually too small to be seen."
17295,"To increase the absorption, it is necessary to increase the “thermal contact.” This is usually done by adding a little iron oxide to the water."
17296,"The iron atoms are like small magnets; as they jiggle around in their thermal dance, they make tiny jiggling magnetic fields at the protons."
17297,These varying fields “couple” the proton magnets to the atomic vibrations and tend to establish thermal equilibrium.
17298,It is through this “coupling” that protons in the higher energy states can lose their energy so that they are again capable of absorbing energy from the oscillator.
17299,In practice the output signal of a nuclear resonance apparatus does not look like a normal resonance curve.
17300,It is usually a more complicated signal with oscillations—like the one drawn in the figure.
17301,Such signal shapes appear because of the changing fields.
17302,"The explanation should be given in terms of quantum mechanics, but it can be shown that in such experiments the classical ideas of precessing moments always give the correct answer."
17303,"Classically, we would say that when we arrive at resonance we start driving a lot of the precessing nuclear magnets synchronously."
17304,"In so doing, we make them precess together."
17305,"But because the magnetic field is increasing with time, the precession frequency is increasing also, and the induced voltage is soon at a frequency a little higher than the oscillator frequency."
17306,"As the induced emf goes alternately in phase and out of phase with the oscillator, the “absorbed” power goes alternately positive and negative."
17307,So on the oscilloscope we see the beat note between the proton frequency and the oscillator frequency.
17308,"Because the proton frequencies are not all identical (different protons are in slightly different fields) and also possibly because of the disturbance from the iron oxide in the water, the freely precessing moments soon get out of phase, and the beat signal disappears."
17309,These phenomena of magnetic resonance have been put to use in many ways as tools for finding out new things about matter—especially in chemistry and nuclear physics.
17310,It goes without saying that the numerical values of the magnetic moments of nuclei tell us something about their structure.
17311,"In chemistry, much has been learned from the structure (or shape) of the resonances."
17312,"Because of magnetic fields produced by nearby nuclei, the exact position of a nuclear resonance is shifted somewhat, depending on the environment in which any particular nucleus finds itself."
17313,Measuring these shifts helps determine which atoms are near which other ones and helps to elucidate the details of the structure of molecules.
17314,Equally important is the electron spin resonance of free radicals.
17315,"Although not present to any very large extent in equilibrium, such radicals are often intermediate states of chemical reactions."
17316,A measurement of an electron spin resonance is a delicate test for the presence of free radicals and is often the key to understanding the mechanism of certain chemical reactions.
17317,In this chapter we will discuss some materials in which the net effect of the magnetic moments in the material is much greater than in the case of paramagnetism or diamagnetism.
17318,The phenomenon is called ferromagnetism.
17319,In paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials the induced magnetic moments are usually so weak that we don’t have to worry about the additional fields produced by the magnetic moments.
17320,"For ferromagnetic materials, however, the magnetic moments induced by applied magnetic fields are quite enormous and have a great effect on the fields themselves."
17321,"In fact, the induced moments are so strong that they are often the dominant effect in producing the observed fields."
17322,So one of the things we will have to worry about is the mathematical theory of large induced magnetic moments.
17323,"That is, of course, just a technical question."
17324,"The real problem is, why are the magnetic moments so strong—how does it all work?"
17325,We will come to that question in a little while.
17326,Finding the magnetic fields of ferromagnetic materials is something like the problem of finding the electrostatic field in the presence of dielectrics.
17327,"(36.2), of course, is useful only if we know some relation between them."
17328,"We have seen that the theory which relates the induced electric dipole moment to the field was a relatively complicated business and can really only be applied to certain simple situations, and even then as an approximation."
17329,We would like to remind you of one of the approximate ideas we used.
17330,"To find the induced dipole moment of an atom inside a dielectric, it is necessary to know the electric field that acts on an individual atom."
17331,We made the approximation—which is not too bad in many cases—that the field on the atom is the same as it would be at the center of the small hole which would be left if we took out the atom (keeping the dipole moments of all the neighboring atoms the same).
17332,You will also remember that the electric field in a hole in a polarized dielectric depends on the shape of the hole.
17333,We summarize our earlier results in Fig.
17334,36–1.
17335,Now we have to discuss the analog of all this for the case of magnetism.
17336,"The trouble is, of course, that there isn’t any such thing as a “magnetic charge” in the physical world."
17337,Then we could make a complete analogy with the electrostatic case and use all our old equations from electrostatics.
17338,People have often done something like that.
17339,"In fact, historically, people even believed that the analogy was right."
17340,"It is therefore nicer from a physical point of view to describe things realistically in terms of the atomic currents, rather than in terms of a density of some mythical “magnetic poles.” Incidentally, these currents are sometimes called “Ampèrian” currents, because Ampère first suggested that the magnetism of matter came from circulating atomic currents."
17341,"The actual microscopic current density in magnetized matter is, of course, very complicated."
17342,Its value depends on where you look in the atom—it’s large in some places and small in others; it goes one way in one part of the atom and the opposite way in another part (just as the microscopic electric field varies enormously inside a dielectric).
17343,"In many practical problems, however, we are interested only in the fields outside of the matter or in the average magnetic field inside of the matter—where we mean an average taken over many, many atoms."
17344,It is usually most convenient to separate the currents into three parts.
17345,In Chapter 32 we made a distinction between the currents which flow freely on conductors and the ones which are due to the back and forth motions of the bound charges in dielectrics.
17346,Now we want to go further.
17347,"The last term will generally refer to currents in conductors, but it may also include other currents—for example the currents from charges moving freely through empty space."
17348,Let’s see if we can understand why this is so.
17349,"First, let’s take the case of a cylindrical rod which has a uniform magnetization parallel to its axis."
17350,"Physically, we know that such a uniform magnetization really means a uniform density of atomic circulating currents everywhere inside the material."
17351,Suppose we try to imagine what the actual currents would look like in a cross section of the material.
17352,We would expect to see currents something like those shown in Fig.
17353,36–2.
17354,"Each atomic current goes around and around in a little circle, with all the circulating currents going around in the same direction."
17355,Now what is the effective current of such a thing?
17356,"Well, in most of the bar there is no effect at all, because right next to each current there is another current going in the opposite direction."
17357,If we imagine a small surface—but one still quite a bit larger than a single atom—such as is indicated in Fig.
17358,There is no net current anywhere inside the material.
17359,"Note, however, that at the surface of the material there are atomic currents which are not cancelled by neighboring currents going the other way."
17360,At the surface there is a net current always going in the same direction around the rod.
17361,Now you see why we said earlier that a uniformly magnetized rod is equivalent to a long solenoid carrying an electric current.
17362,How does this view fit with Eq.
17363,(36.7)?
17364,This agrees with our geometric picture.
17365,"So, right at the surface there are terrific gradients which, according to (36.7), will give a high current density."
17366,36–2.
17367,Writing out the components of Eq.
17368,This agrees with our picture of a surface current going around the bar.
17369,Now we want to find the current density for a more complicated case in which the magnetization varies from point to point in a material.
17370,"It is easy to see qualitatively that if the magnetization is different in two neighboring regions, there will not be a perfect cancellation of the circulating currents so that there will be a net current in the volume of the material."
17371,It is this effect that we want to work out quantitatively.
17372,36–3).
17373,"Now let’s consider a small rectangular block inside of a magnetized material, as sketched in Fig."
17374,36–4.
17375,We take the block so small that we can consider that the magnetization is uniform inside it.
17376,We can find the magnitude of these currents from Eq.
17377,(36.9).
17378,"Now suppose that we imagine two such little blocks next to each other, as shown in Fig."
17379,36–5.
17380,Now on the surface between the two blocks there will be two contributions to the total current.
17381,36–6.
17382,(36.7).
17383,"Next, we want to insert the current as written in Eq."
17384,(36.10) into Maxwell’s equations.
17385,Now we have to give you a warning.
17386,"With this definition, Eq."
17387,"But if you are going to be an engineer and work on the design of transformers, magnets, and such, you will have to watch out."
17388,(36.14) rather than our definition of Eq.
17389,You’ll have to be careful to figure out which convention they are using.
17390,One way to tell is by the units they use.
17391,You can see that this also agrees with Eq.
17392,"But a “turn” is really a dimensionless number, so that doesn’t need to confuse you."
17393,There is one more horrible thing.
17394,We have summarized the confusion about magnetic units in Table 36–1.
17395,"Suppose we have a torus (a donut) of iron wrapped with a coil of copper wire, as shown in Fig."
17396,36–7(a).
17397,What is the magnetic field?
17398,36–7(b).
17399,(36.16) is satisfied.
17400,"Next, we write Eq."
17401,36–7(b).
17402,This surface is cut once by each turn of the winding.
17403,But there isn’t any such equation!
17404,"There is, of course, Eq."
17405,"All is not lost, though."
17406,We can get solutions in certain simple cases.
17407,"If we start out with unmagnetized iron—let’s say with iron that has been annealed at high temperatures—then in the simple geometry of the torus, all the iron will have the same magnetic history."
17408,We say that the iron saturates.
17409,"With the scales of our figure, the curve appears to become horizontal."
17410,36–8—which is the so-called magnetization curve—is highly nonlinear.
17411,But it’s worse than that.
17412,Even with no magnetizing current there is a magnetic field in the iron—it has become permanently magnetized.
17413,The loop made by repeated oscillation of the fields is called a hysteresis loop of the iron.
17414,"Naturally, the magnetization and hysteresis curves are different for different substances."
17415,"The shape of the curves depends critically on the chemical composition of the material, and also on the details of its preparation and subsequent physical treatment."
17416,We will discuss some of the physical explanations for these complications in the next chapter.
17417,"One of the most important applications of magnetic materials is in electrical circuits—for example, in transformers, electric motors, and so on."
17418,"One reason is that with iron we can control where the magnetic fields go, and also get much larger fields for a given electric current."
17419,"For example, the typical “toroidal” inductance is made very much like the object shown in Fig."
17420,36–7.
17421,"For a given inductance, it can be much smaller in volume and use much less copper than an equivalent “air-core” inductance."
17422,"For a given inductance, we get a much smaller resistance in the winding, so the inductance is more nearly “ideal”—particularly for low frequencies."
17423,"It is very easy to understand, qualitatively, how such an inductance works."
17424,(36.20).
17425,"Physically, what happens is that a small current in the coil, which would ordinarily produce a small magnetic field, causes the little “slave” magnets in the iron to line up and produce a tremendously greater “magnetic” current than the external current in the winding."
17426,It is as if we had a lot more current going through the coil than we really have.
17427,"When we reverse the current, all the little magnets flip over—all those internal currents reverse—and we get a much higher induced emf than we would get without the iron."
17428,"If we want to calculate the inductance, we can do so through the energy—as described in Section 17–8."
17429,From Eq.
17430,An interesting feature is involved here.
17431,"When we use alternating currents, the iron is driven around a hysteresis loop."
17432,It is the area enclosed inside the hysteresis curve.
17433,"Thus, the driving source delivers a certain net energy each cycle—an energy proportional to the area inside the hysteresis loop."
17434,"And that energy is “lost.” It is lost from the electromagnetic goings on, but turns up as heat in the iron."
17435,It is called the hysteresis loss.
17436,"To keep such energy losses small, we would like the hysteresis loop to be as narrow as possible."
17437,One way to decrease the area of the loop is to reduce the maximum field that is reached during each cycle.
17438,"For smaller maximum fields, we get a hysteresis curve like the one shown in Fig."
17439,36–9.
17440,"Also, special materials are designed to have a very narrow loop."
17441,The so-called transformer irons—which are iron alloys with a small amount of silicon—have been developed to have this property.
17442,It is called the permeability of the iron.
17443,(It is also sometimes called the “relative permeability.”) The permeability of ordinary irons is typically several thousand.
17444,There are special alloys alike “supermalloy” which can have permeabilities as high as a million.
17445,"(You will remember that we spoke in Chapter 50, Vol."
17446,"I, about the generation of harmonics in nonlinear systems.)"
17447,"For such purposes, Eq."
17448,(36.23) is a useful approximation.
17449,"On the other hand, if you want to generate harmonics, you may use an inductance which is intentionally operated in a highly nonlinear way."
17450,A “transformer” is often made by putting two coils on the same torus—or core—of a magnetic material.
17451,"(For the larger transformers, the core is made with rectangular proportions for convenience.)"
17452,"Then a varying current in the “primary” winding causes the magnetic field in the core to change, which induces an emf in the “secondary” winding."
17453,"Since the flux through each turn of both windings is the same, the emf’s in the two windings are in the same ratio as the number of turns on each."
17454,A voltage applied to the primary is transformed to a different voltage at the secondary.
17455,"Since a certain net current around the core is needed to produce the required change in the magnetic field, the algebraic sum of the currents in the two windings will be fixed and equal to the required “magnetizing” current."
17456,"If the current drawn from the secondary increases, the primary current must increase in proportion—there is a “transformation” of currents as well as voltage."
17457,Now let’s discuss a practical situation which is a little more complicated.
17458,Suppose we have an electromagnet of the rather standard form shown in Fig.
17459,"36–10—there is a “C-shaped” yoke of iron, with a coil of many turns of wire wrapped around the yoke."
17460,They will look more or less as shown in Fig.
17461,36–11(a).
17462,"They tend to spread out somewhat in the gap, but if the gap is narrow, this will be a small effect."
17463,This follows from Eq.
17464,(36.16).
17465,"36–11(b), which has one face in the gap and the other in the iron."
17466,We can again use Eq.
17467,36–11(b).
17468,"However, let’s do the general case, in which the magnetization curve of the iron is one like that shown in Fig."
17469,36–8.
17470,What we want is the simultaneous solution of this functional relationship together with Eq.
17471,(36.27).
17472,We can find it by plotting a graph of Eq.
17473,"(36.27) on the same graph with the magnetization curve, as is done in Fig."
17474,36–12.
17475,"Where the two curves intersect, we have our solution."
17476,36–12.
17477,Different currents just shift the line horizontally.
17478,From Fig.
17479,"36–12, we see that for a given current there are several different solutions, depending on how you got there."
17480,The field in the gap will depend on what you have done in the past.
17481,There are still various possible solutions.
17482,"You can take the coil off, and you have a permanent magnet."
17483,"You can see that for a good permanent magnet, you would want a material with a wide hysteresis loop."
17484,"Special alloys, such as Alnico V, have very wide loops."
17485,We now turn to the question of why it is that in ferromagnetic materials a small magnetic field produces such a large magnetization.
17486,The magnetization of ferromagnetic materials like iron and nickel comes from the magnetic moment of the electrons in the inner shell of the atom.
17487,(It is easy to extend the arguments to iron.)
17488,"In the ferromagnetic case, there is a complication."
17489,"Instead, we must do as we did in the case of dielectrics—we have to find the local field acting at a single atom."
17490,For an exact calculation we should add up the fields at the atom in question contributed by all of the other atoms in the crystal lattice.
17491,"But as we did for dielectrics, we will make the approximation that the field at an atom is the same as we would find in a small spherical hole in the material—assuming that the moments of the atoms in the neighborhood are not changed by the presence of the hole."
17492,"We can, however, make use of the results of Chapter 11 if we make a careful comparison of the equations of Chapter 11 with the equations for ferromagnetism in this chapter."
17493,Let’s put together the corresponding equations.
17494,This purely algebraic correspondence has led to some confusion in the past.
17495,"So although the equations are analogous, the physics is not analogous."
17496,"However, that doesn’t need to stop us from using the principle that the same equations have the same solutions."
17497,We can use our earlier results for the electric field inside of holes of various shapes in dielectrics—summarized in Fig.
17498,"It is, of course, possible to get these results in a more physical way, by using the Maxwell equations directly."
17499,"For example, Eq."
17500,(You use a Gaussian surface that is half in the material and half out.)
17501,"Similarly, you can get Eq."
17502,(36.33) by using a line integral along a curve that goes up inside the hole and returns through the material.
17503,We will leave it for you to show that Eq.
17504,(36.35) can also be obtained by considering the effects of the surface currents on the boundary of the spherical cavity.
17505,In finding the equilibrium magnetization from Eq.
17506,"Also, we will take all the fields in the same direction so that we won’t need to worry about the vector directions."
17507,If we were now to substitute Eq.
17508,(36.36) into Eq.
17509,Let’s put the problem in a generalized form by writing Eq.
17510,36–13.
17511,36–13.
17512,We have solved the problem.
17513,Let’s look at how the solutions will go for various circumstances.
17514,36–14.
17515,You will notice from Eq.
17516,It turns out that only the upper solution is stable—as you can see by considering small variations about these solutions.
17517,"According to these ideas, then, a magnetic material should magnetize itself spontaneously at sufficiently low temperatures."
17518,"In short, when the thermal motions are small enough, the coupling between the atomic magnets causes them all to line up parallel to each other—we have a permanently magnetized material analogous to the ferroelectrics we discussed in Chapter 11."
17519,We can see from Fig.
17520,36–14 how things will go if we shift our straight lines a little to the right.
17521,Then the results are just what we had in Chapter 35.
17522,We can check our theoretical picture with the experimental data for nickel.
17523,(36.39).
17524,Our theory of ferromagnetism fails completely.
17525,It turns out that one gets similar values for other ferromagnetic materials like iron.
17526,"To see what this means, let’s go back to Eq."
17527,(36.36).
17528,"Even if our model of a spherical hole were not very good, we would still expect some reduction."
17529,"Instead, to explain the phenomenon of ferromagnetism, we have to imagine that the magnetization of the field enhances the local field by some large factor—like one thousand or more."
17530,There doesn’t seem to be any reasonable way to manufacture such tremendous fields at an atom—nor even fields of the proper sign!
17531,"Clearly, our “magnetic” theory of ferromagnetism is a dismal failure."
17532,"We must conclude, then, that ferromagnetism has to do with some nonmagnetic interaction between the spinning electrons in neighboring atoms."
17533,This interaction must generate a strong tendency for all of the nearby spins to line up in one direction.
17534,We will see later that it has to do with quantum mechanics and the Pauli exclusion principle.
17535,36–14.
17536,36–15.
17537,This curve should be the same for all ferromagnetic materials for which the atomic moment comes from a single electron.
17538,The curves for other materials are only slightly different.
17539,"As the temperature is increased, the magnetization decreases, falling to zero at the Curie temperature."
17540,The points in Fig.
17541,36–15 are the experimental observations for nickel.
17542,They fit the theoretical curve fairly well.
17543,"Even though we don’t understand the basic mechanism, the general features of the theory seem to be correct."
17544,"Finally, there is one more disturbing discrepancy in our attempt to understand ferromagnetism."
17545,But that’s not what we found when we measured the magnetization curve for iron.
17546,It only became permanently magnetized after we had “magnetized” it.
17547,"According to the ideas just discussed, it would magnetize itself!"
17548,What is wrong?
17549,"Well, it turns out that if you look at a small enough crystal of iron or nickel, it is indeed completely magnetized!"
17550,"But in large pieces of iron, there are many small regions or “domains” that are magnetized in different directions, so that on a large scale the average magnetization appears to be zero."
17551,The consequences of this domain structure are that gross properties of large pieces of material are quite different from the microscopic properties that we have really been treating.
17552,We will take up in the next lecture the story of the practical behavior of bulk magnetic materials.
17553,In this chapter we will discuss the behavior and peculiarities of ferromagnetic materials and of other strange magnetic materials.
17554,"Before proceeding to study magnetic materials, however, we will review very quickly some of the things about the general theory of magnets that we learned in the last chapter."
17555,We emphasize that this is not supposed to represent the actual currents.
17556,"When the magnetization is uniform the currents do not really cancel out precisely; that is, the whirling currents of one electron in one atom and the whirling currents of an electron in another atom do not overlap in such a way that the sum is exactly zero."
17557,Even within a single atom the distribution of magnetism is not smooth.
17558,"For instance, in an iron atom the magnetization is distributed in a more or less spherical shell, not too close to the nucleus and not too far away."
17559,"Thus, magnetism in matter is quite a complicated thing in its details; it is very irregular."
17560,"However, we are obliged now to ignore this detailed complexity and discuss phenomena from a gross, average point of view."
17561,"In the last chapter, we also discovered that a ferromagnetic material has the following interesting property: above a certain temperature it is not strongly magnetic, whereas below this temperature it becomes magnetic."
17562,This fact is easily demonstrated.
17563,A piece of nickel wire at room temperature is attracted by a magnet.
17564,"However, if we heat it above its Curie temperature with a gas flame, it becomes nonmagnetic and is not attracted toward the magnet—even when brought quite close to the magnet."
17565,"If we let it lie near the magnet while it cools off, at the instant its temperature falls below the critical temperature it is suddenly attracted again by the magnet!"
17566,The general theory of ferromagnetism that we will use supposes that the spin of the electron is responsible for the magnetization.
17567,"The electron spin can be pointed either “up” or “down.” Because the electron has a negative charge, when its spin is “up” it has a negative moment, and when its spin is “down” it has a positive moment."
17568,"In iron, if the moment of a nearby atom is “up,” there is a very strong tendency that the moment of the one next to it will also be “up.” That is what makes iron, cobalt, and nickel so strongly magnetic—the moments all want to be parallel."
17569,The first question we have to discuss is why.
17570,"Soon after the development of quantum mechanics, it was noticed that there is a very strong apparent force—not a magnetic force or any other kind of actual force, but only an apparent force—trying to line the spins of nearby electrons opposite to one another."
17571,These forces are closely related to chemical valence forces.
17572,"There is a principle in quantum mechanics—called the exclusion principle—that two electrons cannot occupy exactly the same state, that they cannot be in exactly the same condition as to location and spin orientation.1 For example, if they are at the same point, the only alternative is to have their spins opposite."
17573,"So, if there is a region of space between atoms where electrons like to congregate (as in a chemical bond) and we want to put another electron on top of one already there, the only way to do it is to have the spin of the second one pointed opposite to the spin of the first one."
17574,"To have the spins parallel is against the law, unless the electrons stay away from each other."
17575,This has the effect that a pair of parallel-spin electrons near to each other have much more energy than a pair of opposite-spin electrons; the net effect is as though there were a force trying to turn the spin over.
17576,"Sometimes this spin-turning force is called the exchange force, but that only makes it more mysterious—it is not a very good term."
17577,It is just because of the exclusion principle that electrons have a tendency to make their spins opposite.
17578,"In fact, that is the explanation of the lack of magnetism in almost all substances!"
17579,The spins of the free electrons on the outside of the atoms have tremendous tendency to balance in opposite directions.
17580,The problem is to explain why for materials like iron it is just the reverse of what we should expect.
17581,"When it was clear that quantum mechanics could supply a tremendous spin-orientating force—even if, apparently, of the wrong sign—it was suggested that ferromagnetism might have its origin in this same force, that due to the complexities of iron and the large number of electrons involved, the sign of the interaction energy would come out the other way around."
17582,The most recent calculations of the energy between the two electron spins in iron—assuming that the interaction is a direct one between the two electrons in neighboring atoms—still give the wrong sign.
17583,The present understanding of this is again to assume that the complexity of the situation is somehow responsible and to hope that the next man who makes the calculation with a more complicated situation will get the right answer!
17584,"It is believed that the up-spin of one of the electrons in the inside shell, which is making the magnetism, tends to make the conduction electrons which fly around the outside have the opposite spin."
17585,One might expect this to happen because the conduction electrons come into the same region as the “magnetic” electrons.
17586,"Since they move around, they can carry their prejudice for being upside down over to the next atom; that is, one “magnetic” electron tries to force the conduction electrons to be opposite, and the conduction electron then makes the next “magnetic” electron opposite to it."
17587,The double interaction is equivalent to an interaction which tries to line up the two “magnetic” electrons.
17588,"In other words, the tendency to make parallel spins is the result of an intermediary that tends to some extent to be opposite to both."
17589,"This mechanism does not require that the conduction electrons be completely “upside down.” They could just have a slight prejudice to be down, just enough to load the “magnetic” odds the other way."
17590,This is the mechanism that the people who have calculated such things now believe is responsible for ferromagnetism.
17591,"In short, we don’t thoroughly understand it."
17592,"Now let us continue with the theory, and then come back later to discuss a certain error involved in the way we have set it up."
17593,"If the magnetic moment of a certain electron is “up,” energy comes both from the external field and also from the tendency of the spins to be parallel."
17594,"Since the energy is lower when the spins are parallel, the effect is sometimes thought of as due to an “effective internal field.” But remember, it is not due to a true magnetic force; it is an interaction that is more complicated."
17595,"In any case, we take Eqs."
17596,(37.1) as the formulas for the energies of the two spin states of a “magnetic” electron.
17597,Now we would like to calculate the internal energy of the material.
17598,Now this is not quite correct.
17599,"(When we consider the energy of one electron in the field of the rest and then the energy of a second electron in the field of the rest, we have counted part of the first energy once more.)"
17600,"In the last chapter we discovered an interesting thing—that below a certain temperature the material finds a solution to the equations in which the magnetic moment is not zero, even with no external magnetizing field."
17601,37–1.
17602,"The dashed curve marked “cobalt, nickel” shows the experimental results for crystals of these elements."
17603,The theory and experiment are in reasonably good agreement.
17604,The figure also shows the result of the classical theory in which the calculation is carried out assuming that the atomic magnets can have all possible orientations in space.
17605,You can see that this assumption gives a prediction that is not even close to the experimental facts.
17606,Even the quantum theory deviates from the observed behavior at both high and low temperatures.
17607,The reason for the deviations is that we have made a rather sloppy approximation in the theory: We have assumed that the energy of an atom depends upon the mean magnetization of its neighboring atoms.
17608,"In other words, for each one that is “up” in the neighborhood of a given atom, there will be a contribution of energy due to that quantum mechanical alignment effect."
17609,But how many are there pointed “up”?
17610,A particular atom somewhere might find all its neighbors “up.” Then its energy will be larger than the average.
17611,"Another one might find some up and some down, perhaps averaging to zero, and it would have no energy from that term, and so on."
17612,"What we ought to do is to use some more complicated kind of average, because the atoms in different places have different environments, and the numbers up and down are different for different ones."
17613,"Instead of just taking one atom subjected to the average influence, we should take each one in its actual situation, compute its energy, and find the average energy."
17614,But how do we find out how many are “up” and how many are “down” in the neighborhood?
17615,"That is, of course, just what we are trying to calculate—the number “up” and “down”—so we have a very complicated interconnected problem of correlations, a problem which has never been solved."
17616,"It is an intriguing and exciting one which has existed for years and on which some of the greatest names in physics have written papers, but even they have not completely solved it."
17617,"It is often easy to calculate small departures from some simple, idealized situation, so it is fairly well understood why there are deviations from the simple theory at low temperature."
17618,It is also understood physically that for statistical reasons the magnetization should deviate at high temperatures.
17619,But the exact behavior near the Curie point has never been thoroughly figured out.
17620,That’s an interesting problem to work out some day if you want a problem that has never been solved.
17621,In the last chapter we laid the groundwork necessary for calculating the thermodynamic properties of ferromagnetic materials.
17622,"These are, naturally, related to the internal energy of the crystal, which includes interactions of the various spins, given by Eq."
17623,(37.3).
17624,"37–1, as drawn in Fig."
17625,37–2(a).
17626,If we were to measure then the specific heat of such a material we would obtain a curve which is the derivative of 37–2(a).
17627,It is shown in Fig.
17628,37–2(b).
17629,The sharp drop is due to the change in slope of the magnetic energy and is reached right at the Curie point.
17630,So without any magnetic measurements at all we could have discovered that something was going on inside of iron or nickel by measuring this thermodynamic property.
17631,"However, both experiment and improved theory (with fluctuations included) suggest that this simple curve is wrong and that the true situation is really more complicated."
17632,The curve goes higher at the peak and falls to zero somewhat slowly.
17633,"Even if the temperature is high enough to randomize the spins on the average, there are still local regions where there is a certain amount of polarization, and in these regions the spins still have a little extra energy of interaction—which only dies out slowly as things get more and more random with further increases in temperature."
17634,So the actual curve looks like Fig.
17635,37–2(c).
17636,One of the challenges of theoretical physics today is to find an exact theoretical description of the character of the specific heat near the Curie transition—an intriguing problem which has not yet been solved.
17637,"Naturally, this problem is very closely related to the shape of the magnetization curve in the same region."
17638,"Now we want to describe some experiments, other than thermodynamic ones, which show that there is something right about our interpretation of magnetism."
17639,We can check this by an experiment.
17640,Suppose we suspend a bar magnet by a thin fiber and then surround it by a coil so that we can reverse the magnetic field without touching the magnet or putting any torque on it.
17641,"This is a very difficult experiment because the magnetic forces are so enormous that any irregularities, any lopsidedness, or any lack of perfection in the iron will produce accidental torques."
17642,"However, the experiment has been done under careful conditions in which such accidental torques are minimized."
17643,"By means of the magnetic field from a coil that surrounds the bar, we turn all the atomic magnets over at once."
17644,When we do this we also change the angular momenta of all the spins from “up” to “down” (see Fig.
17645,37–3).
17646,"If angular momentum is to be conserved when the spins all turn over, the rest of the bar must have an opposite change in angular momentum."
17647,The whole magnet will start to spin.
17648,"And sure enough, when we do the experiment, we find a slight turning of the magnet."
17649,"Actually, our calculations assume that the atomic magnets are due purely to the electron spin, but there is, in addition, some orbital motion also in most materials."
17650,The orbital motion is not completely free of the lattice and does not contribute much more than a few percent to the magnetism.
17651,"Thus, a slight discrepancy with the gyromagnetic measurements is quite understandable."
17652,We have concluded from our theoretical analysis that a ferromagnetic material should spontaneously become magnetized below a certain temperature so that all the magnetism would be in the same direction.
17653,But we know that this is not true for an ordinary piece of unmagnetized iron.
17654,Why isn’t all iron magnetized?
17655,We can explain it with the help of Fig.
17656,37–4.
17657,Suppose the iron were all a big single crystal of the shape shown in Fig.
17658,37–4(a) and spontaneously magnetized all in one direction.
17659,"Then there would be a considerable external magnetic field, which would have a lot of energy."
17660,"We can reduce that field energy if we arrange that one side of the block is magnetized “up” and the other side magnetized “down,” as in Fig."
17661,37–4(b).
17662,"Then, of course, the fields outside the iron would extend over less volume, so there would be less energy there."
17663,"Ah, but wait!"
17664,In the layer between the two regions we have up-spinning electrons adjacent to down-spinning electrons.
17665,But ferromagnetism appears only in those materials for which the energy is reduced if the electrons are parallel rather than opposite.
17666,"So, we have added some extra energy along the dotted line in Fig."
17667,37–4(b); this energy is sometimes called wall energy.
17668,A region having only one direction of magnetization is called a domain.
17669,"At the interface—the “wall”—between two domains, where we have atoms on opposite sides which are spinning in different directions, there is an energy per unit area of the wall."
17670,"We have described it as though two adjacent atoms were spinning exactly opposite, but it turns out that nature adjusts things so that the transition is more gradual."
17671,But we don’t need to worry about such fine details at this point.
17672,Now the question is: When is it better or worse to make a wall?
17673,The answer is that it depends on the size of the domains.
17674,Suppose that we were to scale up a block so that the whole thing was twice as big.
17675,"The volume in the space outside filled with a given magnetic field strength would be eight times bigger, and the energy in the magnetic field, which is proportional to the volume, would also be eight times greater."
17676,"But the surface area between two domains, which will give the wall energy, would be only four times as big."
17677,"Therefore, if the piece of iron is big enough, it will pay to split it into more domains."
17678,This is why only the very tiny crystals can have but a single domain.
17679,"Any large object—one more than about a hundredth of a millimeter in size—will have at least one domain wall; and any ordinary, “centimeter-size” object will be split into many domains, as shown in the figure."
17680,Splitting into domains goes on until the energy needed to put in one extra wall is as large as the energy decrease in the magnetic field outside the crystal.
17681,"Actually nature has discovered still another way to lower the energy: It is not necessary to have the field go outside at all, if a little triangular region is magnetized sideways, as in Fig."
17682,37–4(d).3 Then with the arrangement of Fig.
17683,"37–4(d) we see that there is no external field, but instead only a little more domain wall."
17684,But that introduces a new kind of problem.
17685,"It turns out that when a single crystal of iron is magnetized, it changes its length in the direction of magnetization, so an “ideal” cube with its magnetization, say, “up,” is no longer a perfect cube."
17686,The “vertical” dimension will be different from the “horizontal” dimension.
17687,This effect is called magnetostriction.
17688,"Because of such geometric changes, the little triangular pieces of Fig."
17689,"37–4(d) do not, so to speak, “fit” into the available space anymore—the crystal has got too long one way and too short the other way."
17690,"Of course, it does fit, really, but only by being squashed in; and this involves some mechanical stresses."
17691,"So, this arrangement also introduces an extra energy."
17692,It is the balance of all these various energies which determines how the domains finally arrange themselves in their complicated fashion in a piece of unmagnetized iron.
17693,"Now, what happens when we put on an external magnetic field?"
17694,"To take a simple case, consider a crystal whose domains are as shown in Fig."
17695,37–4(d).
17696,"If we apply an external magnetic field in the upward direction, in what manner does the crystal become magnetized?"
17697,"First, the middle domain wall can move over sideways (to the right) and reduce the energy."
17698,"It moves over so that the region which is “up” becomes bigger than the region which is “down.” There are more elementary magnets lined up with the field, and this gives a lower energy."
17699,"So, for a piece of iron in weak fields—at the very beginning of magnetization—the domain walls begin to move and eat into the regions which are magnetized opposite to the field."
17700,"As the field continues to increase, a whole crystal shifts gradually into a single large domain which the external field helps to keep lined up."
17701,In a strong field the crystal “likes” to be all one way just because its energy in the applied field is reduced—it is no longer merely the crystal’s own external field which matters.
17702,What if the geometry is not so simple?
17703,"We might think that domains would reform themselves with their magnetization parallel to the field, and then as before, they could all grow into one domain."
17704,"But this is not easy for the iron to do, for the energy needed to magnetize a crystal depends on the direction of magnetization relative to the crystal axis."
17705,"Therefore, if we apply a magnetic field in such a direction, what happens first is that the domains which point along one of the preferred directions which is near to the applied field grow until the magnetization is all along one of these directions."
17706,"Then with much stronger fields, the magnetization is gradually pulled around parallel to the field, as sketched in Fig."
17707,37–5.
17708,In Fig.
17709,37–6 are shown some observations of the magnetization curves of single crystals of iron.
17710,"To understand them, we must first explain something about the notation that is used in describing directions in a crystal."
17711,There are many ways in which a crystal can be sliced so as to produce a face which is a plane of atoms.
17712,Everyone who has driven past an orchard or vineyard knows this—it is fascinating to watch.
17713,"If you look one way, you see lines of trees—if you look another way, you see different lines of trees, and so on."
17714,"In a similar way, a crystal has definite families of planes that hold many atoms, and the planes have this important characteristic (we consider a cubic crystal to make it easier): If we observe where the planes intersect the three coordinate axes—we find that the reciprocals of the three distances from the origin are in the ratio of simple whole numbers."
17715,These three whole numbers are taken as the definition of the planes.
17716,"For example, in Fig."
17717,The direction perpendicular to such a plane (in a cubic crystal) is given the same set of numbers.
17718,37–7(c).
17719,Returning now to Fig.
17720,"37–6, we see the magnetization curves of a single crystal of iron for various directions."
17721,"First, note that for very tiny fields—so weak that it is hard to see them on the scale at all—the magnetization increases extremely rapidly to quite large values."
17722,What happened is that the domains which were already there are very easily removed.
17723,Only a small field is required to make the domain walls move and eat up all of the “wrong-way” domains.
17724,"Single crystals of iron are enormously permeable (magnetic sense), much more so than ordinary polycrystalline iron."
17725,A perfect crystal magnetizes extremely easily.
17726,Why is it curved at all?
17727,Why doesn’t it just go right up to saturation?
17728,We are not sure.
17729,You might study that some day.
17730,We do understand why it is flat for high fields.
17731,We turn on a little bit of field and the magnetization leaps up as the domains grow.
17732,"Then as we increase the field some more, we find that it takes quite a lot of field to get up to saturation, because now the magnetization is turning away from an “easy” direction."
17733,"Figure 37–8 shows the corresponding situation for two other materials, nickel and cobalt."
17734,Nickel is different from iron.
17735,"Cobalt has a hexagonal crystal form, and people have botched up the system of nomenclature for this case."
17736,"They want to have three axes on the bottom of the hexagon and one perpendicular to these, so they have used four indices."
17737,We see that crystals of different metals behave in different ways.
17738,"Now we must discuss a polycrystalline material, such as an ordinary piece of iron."
17739,"Inside such materials there are many, many little crystals with their crystalline axes pointing every which way."
17740,These are not the same as domains.
17741,"Remember that the domains were all part of a single crystal, but in a piece of iron there are many different crystals with axes at different orientations, as shown in Fig."
17742,37–9.
17743,"Within each of these crystals, there will also generally be some domains."
17744,"When we apply a small magnetic field to a piece of polycrystalline material, what happens is that the domain walls begin to move, and the domains which have a favorable direction of easy magnetization grow larger."
17745,"This growth is reversible so long as the field stays very small—if we turn the field off, the magnetization will return to zero."
17746,37–10.
17747,"In every small crystal of the material, there are strains and dislocations; there are impurities, dirt, and imperfections."
17748,"And at all but the smallest fields, the domain wall, in moving, gets stuck on these."
17749,"There is an interaction energy between the domain wall and a dislocation, or a grain boundary, or an impurity."
17750,"So when the wall gets to one of them, it gets stuck; it sticks there at a certain field."
17751,"But then if the field is raised some more, the wall suddenly snaps past."
17752,So the motion of the domain wall is not smooth the way it is in a perfect crystal—it gets hung up every once in a while and moves in jerks.
17753,"If we were to look at the magnetization on a microscopic scale, we would see something like the insert of Fig."
17754,37–10.
17755,Now the important thing is that these jerks in the magnetization can cause an energy loss.
17756,"In the first place, when a boundary finally slips past an impediment, it moves very quickly to the next one, since the field is already above what would be required for the unimpeded motion."
17757,The rapid motion means that there are rapidly changing magnetic fields which produce eddy currents in the crystal.
17758,These currents lose energy in heating the metal.
17759,"A second effect is that when a domain suddenly changes, part of the crystal changes its dimensions from the magnetostriction."
17760,Each sudden shift of a domain wall sets up a little sound wave that carries away energy.
17761,"Because of such effects, the second part of magnetization curve is irreversible, and there is energy being lost."
17762,"This is the origin of the hysteresis effect, because to move a boundary wall forward—snap—and then to move it backward—snap—produces a different result."
17763,"It’s like “jerky” friction, and it takes energy."
17764,"Eventually, for high enough fields, when we have moved all the domain walls and magnetized each crystal in its best direction, there are still some crystallites which happen to have their easy directions of magnetization not in the direction of our external magnetic field."
17765,Then it takes a lot of extra field to turn those magnetic moments around.
17766,"The magnetization does not come sharply to its saturation value, because in the last part of the curve the atomic magnets are turning in the strong field."
17767,"So we see why the magnetization curve of an ordinary polycrystalline materials, such as the one shown in Fig."
17768,"37–10, rises a little bit and reversibly at first, then rises irreversibly, and then curves over slowly."
17769,"Of course, there is no sharp break-point between the three regions—they blend smoothly, one into the other."
17770,It is not hard to show that the magnetization process in the middle part of the magnetization curve is jerky—that the domain walls jerk and snap as they shift.
17771,"All you need is a coil of wire—with many thousands of turns—connected to an amplifier and a loudspeaker, as shown in Fig."
17772,37–11.
17773,"If you put a few silicon steel sheets (of the type used in transformers) at the center of the coil and bring a bar magnet slowly near the stack, the sudden changes in magnetization will produce impulses of emf in the coil, which are heard as distinct clicks in the loudspeaker."
17774,As you move the magnet nearer to the iron you will hear a whole rush of clicks that sound something like the noise of sand grains falling over each other as a can of sand is tilted.
17775,"The domain walls are jumping, snapping, and jiggling as the field is increased."
17776,This phenomenon is called the Barkhausen effect.
17777,"As you move the magnet even closer to the iron sheets, the noise grows louder and louder for a while but then there is relatively little noise when the magnet gets very close."
17778,Why?
17779,Because nearly all the domain walls have moved as far as they can go.
17780,"Any greater field is merely turning the magnetization in each domain, which is a smooth process."
17781,"If you now withdraw the magnet, so as to come back on the downward branch of the hysteresis loop, the domains all try to get back to low energy again, and you hear another rush of backward-going jerks."
17782,"You can also note that if you bring the magnet to a given place and move it back and forth a little bit, there is relatively little noise."
17783,"It is again like tilting a can of sand—once the grains shift into place, small movements of the can don’t disturb them."
17784,In the iron the small variations in the magnetic field aren’t enough to move any boundaries over any of the “humps.”
17785,Now we would like to talk about the various kinds of magnetic materials that there are in the technical world and to consider some of the problems involved in designing magnetic materials for different purposes.
17786,"First, the term “the magnetic properties of iron,” which one often hears, is a misnomer—there is no such thing."
17787,“Iron” is not a well-defined material—the properties of iron depend critically on the amount of impurities and also on how the iron is formed.
17788,"You can appreciate that the magnetic properties will depend on how easily the domain walls move and that this is a gross property, not a property of the individual atoms."
17789,So practical ferromagnetism is not really a property of an iron atom—it is a property of solid iron in a certain form.
17790,"For example, iron can take on two different crystalline forms."
17791,"Of course, at that temperature the body-centered cubic structure is already past the Curie point."
17792,"Because its crystal structure is different, it has completely different magnetic properties."
17793,"Most kinds of stainless steel are not magnetic to any appreciable degree, although there are some kinds which are somewhat magnetic—it depends on the composition of the alloy."
17794,"Even when such an alloy is magnetic, it is not ferromagnetic like ordinary iron—even though it is mostly just iron."
17795,We would like now to describe a few of the special materials which have been developed for their particular magnetic properties.
17796,"First, if we want to make a permanent magnet, we would like material with an enormously wide hysteresis loop so that, when we turn the current off and come down to zero magnetizing field, the magnetization will remain large."
17797,For such materials the domain boundaries should be “frozen” in place as much as possible.
17798,(The rather complex composition of this alloy is indicative of the kind of detailed effort that has gone into making good magnets.
17799,What patience it takes to mix five things together and test them until you find the most ideal substance!)
17800,"When Alnico solidifies, there is a “second phase” which precipitates out, making many tiny grains and very high internal strains."
17801,"In this material, the domain boundaries have a hard time moving at all."
17802,"In addition to having a precise composition, Alnico is mechanically “worked” in a way that makes the crystals appear in the form of long grains along the direction in which the magnetization is going to be."
17803,Then the magnetization will have a natural tendency to be lined up in these directions and will be held there from the anisotropic effects.
17804,"Furthermore, the material is even cooled in an external magnetic field when it is manufactured, so that the grains will grow with the right crystal orientation."
17805,The hysteresis loop of Alnico V is shown in Fig.
17806,37–12.
17807,36–8.
17808,Let’s turn now to a different kind of material.
17809,"For building transformers and motors, we want a material which is magnetically “soft”—one in which the magnetism is easily changed so that an enormous amount of magnetization results from a very small applied field."
17810,"To arrange this, we need pure, well-annealed material which will have very few dislocations and impurities so that the domain walls can move easily."
17811,It would also be nice if we could make the anisotropy small.
17812,"Then, even if a grain of the material sits at the wrong angle with respect to the field, it will still magnetize easily."
17813,In addition—possibly by luck or maybe because of some physical relationship between the anisotropy and the magnetostriction effects—it turns out that the magnetostriction of iron and nickel has the opposite sign.
17814,They are called the permalloys.
17815,"Permalloys are useful for high-quality transformers (at low signal levels), but they would be no good at all for permanent magnets."
17816,Permalloys must be very carefully made and handled.
17817,The magnetic properties of a piece of permalloy are drastically changed if it is stressed beyond its elastic limit—it mustn’t be bent.
17818,"Then, its permeability is reduced because of the dislocations, slip bands, and so on, which are produced by the mechanical deformations."
17819,The domain boundaries are no longer easy to move.
17820,"The high permeability can, however, be restored by annealing at high temperatures."
17821,It is often convenient to have some numbers to characterize the various magnetic materials.
17822,37–12.
17823,In Table 37–1 we list these numbers for a few magnetic materials.
17824,We would now like to discuss some of the more exotic magnetic materials.
17825,There are many elements in the periodic table which have incomplete inner electron shells and hence have atomic magnetic moments.
17826,"For instance, right next to the ferromagnetic elements iron, nickel, and cobalt you will find chromium and manganese."
17827,Why aren’t they ferromagnetic?
17828,(37.1) has the opposite sign for these elements.
17829,"In the chromium lattice, for example, the spins of the chromium atoms alternate atom by atom, as shown in Fig."
17830,37–13(b).
17831,"So chromium is “magnetic” from its own point of view, but it is not technically interesting because there are no external magnetic effects."
17832,"Chromium, then, is an example of a material in which quantum mechanical effects make the spins alternate."
17833,Such a material is called antiferromagnetic.
17834,The alignment in antiferromagnetic materials is also temperature dependent.
17835,"Below a critical temperature, all the spins are lined up in the alternating array, but when the material is heated above a certain temperature—which is again called the Curie temperature—the spins suddenly become random."
17836,"There is, internally, a sudden transition."
17837,This transition can be seen in the specific heat curve.
17838,Also it shows up in some special “magnetic” effects.
17839,"For instance, the existence of the alternating spins can be verified by scattering neutrons from a crystal of chromium."
17840,"Because a neutron itself has a spin (and a magnetic moment), it has a different amplitude to be scattered, depending on whether its spin is parallel or opposite to the spin of the scatterer."
17841,"Thus, we get a different interference pattern when the spins in a crystal are alternating than we do when they have a random distribution."
17842,"There is another kind of substance in which quantum mechanical effects make the electron spins alternate, but which is nevertheless ferromagnetic—that is, the crystal has a permanent net magnetization."
17843,The idea behind such materials is shown in Fig.
17844,37–14.
17845,"The figure shows the crystal structure of spinel, a magnesium-aluminum oxide, which—as it is shown—is not magnetic."
17846,The oxide has two kinds of metal atoms: magnesium and aluminum.
17847,"Now if we replace the magnesium and the aluminum by two magnetic elements like iron and zinc, or by zinc and manganese—in other words, if we put in magnetic atoms instead of the nonmagnetic ones—an interesting thing happens."
17848,"37–13(c), and there can be a net magnetization in the material."
17849,The material will then be ferromagnetic—although somewhat weak.
17850,Such materials are called ferrites.
17851,They do not have as high a saturation magnetization as iron—for obvious reasons—so they are only useful for smaller fields.
17852,But they have a very important difference—they are insulators; the ferrites are ferromagnetic insulators.
17853,"In high-frequency fields, they will have very small eddy currents and so can be used, for example, in microwave systems."
17854,"The microwave fields will be able to get inside such an insulating material, whereas they would be kept out by the eddy currents in a conductor like iron."
17855,There is another class of magnetic materials which has only recently been discovered—members of the family of the orthosilicates called garnets.
17856,"They are again crystals in which the lattice contains two kinds of metallic atoms, and we have again a situation in which two kinds of atoms can be substituted almost at will."
17857,Among the many compounds of interest there is one which is completely ferromagnetic.
17858,"It has yttrium and iron in the garnet structure, and the reason it is ferromagnetic is very curious."
17859,"Here again quantum mechanics is making the neighboring spins opposite, so that there is a locked-in system of spins with the electron spins of the iron one way and the electron spins of the yttrium the opposite way."
17860,But the yttrium atom is complicated.
17861,It is a rare-earth element and gets a large contribution to its magnetic moment from orbital motion of the electrons.
17862,"For yttrium, the orbital motion contribution is opposite that of the spin and also is bigger."
17863,"Thus, although quantum mechanics, working through the exclusion principle, makes the spins of the yttrium opposite those of the iron, it makes the total magnetic moment of the yttrium atom parallel to the iron because of the orbital effect—as sketched in Fig."
17864,37–13(d).
17865,The compound is therefore a regular ferromagnet.
17866,Another interesting example of ferromagnetism occurs in some of the rare-earth elements.
17867,It has to do with a still more peculiar arrangement of the spins.
17868,"The material is not ferromagnetic in the sense that the spins are all parallel, nor is it antiferromagnetic in the sense that every atom is opposite."
17869,In these crystals all of the spins in one layer are parallel and lie in the plane of the layer.
17870,"In the next layer all spins are again parallel to each other, but point in a somewhat different direction."
17871,"In the following layer they are in still another direction, and so on."
17872,The result is that the local magnetization vector varies in the form of a spiral—the magnetic moments of the successive layers rotate as we proceed along a line perpendicular to the layers.
17873,It is interesting to try to analyze what happens when a field is applied to such a spiral—all the twistings and turnings that must go on in all those atomic magnets.
17874,(Some people like to amuse themselves with the theory of these things!)
17875,"Not only are there cases of “flat” spirals, but there are also cases in which the directions the magnetic moments of successive layers map out a cone, so that it has a spiral component and also a uniform ferromagnetic component in one direction!"
17876,"The magnetic properties of materials, worked out on a more advanced level than we have been able to do here, have fascinated physicists of all kinds."
17877,"In the first place, there are those practical people who love to work out ways of making things in a better way—they love to design better and more interesting magnetic materials."
17878,"The discovery of things like ferrites, or their application, immediately delights people who like to see clever new ways of doing things."
17879,"Besides this, there are those who find a fascination in the terrible complexity that nature can produce using a few basic laws."
17880,"Starting with one and the same general idea, nature goes from the ferromagnetism of iron and its domains, to the antiferromagnetism of chromium, to the magnetism of ferrites and garnets, to the spiral structure of the rare earth elements, and on, and on."
17881,It is fascinating to discover experimentally all the strange things that go on in these special substances.
17882,"Then, to the theoretical physicists, ferromagnetism presents a number of very interesting, unsolved, and beautiful challenges."
17883,One challenge is to understand why it exists at all.
17884,Another is to predict the statistics of the interacting spins in an ideal lattice.
17885,"Even neglecting any possible extraneous complications, this problem has, so far, defied full understanding."
17886,"The reason that it is so interesting is that it is such an easily stated problem: Given a lot of electron spins in a regular lattice, interacting with such-and-such a law, what do they do?"
17887,"It is simply stated, but it has defied complete analysis for years."
17888,"Although it has been analyzed rather carefully for temperatures not too close to the Curie point, the theory of the sudden transition at the Curie point still needs to be completed."
17889,"Finally, the whole subject of the system of spinning atomic magnets—in ferromagnetic, or in paramagnetic materials and in nuclear magnetism, has also been a fascinating thing to advanced students in physics."
17890,"The system of spins can be pushed on and pulled on with external magnetic fields, so one can do many tricks with resonances, with relaxation effects, with spin-echoes, and with other effects."
17891,It serves as a prototype of many complicated thermodynamic systems.
17892,"But in paramagnetic materials the situation is often fairly simple, and people have been delighted both to do experiments and to explain the phenomena theoretically."
17893,We now close our study of electricity and magnetism.
17894,"In the first chapter, we spoke of the great strides that have been made since the early Greek observation of the strange behaviors of amber and of lodestone."
17895,"Yet in all our long and involved discussion we have never explained why it is that when we rub a piece of amber we get a charge on it, nor have we explained why a lodestone is magnetized!"
17896,"You may say, “Oh, we just didn’t get the right sign.”  No, it is worse than that."
17897,"Even if we did get the right sign, we would still have the question: Why is the piece of lodestone in the ground magnetized?"
17898,"There is the earth’s magnetic field, of course, but where does the earth’s field come from?"
17899,Nobody really knows—there have only been some good guesses.
17900,"So you see, this physics of ours is a lot of fakery—we start out with the phenomena of lodestone and amber, and we end up not understanding either of them very well."
17901,But we have learned a tremendous amount of very exciting and very practical information in the process!
17902,The subject of elasticity deals with the behavior of those substances which have the property of recovering their size and shape when the forces producing deformations are removed.
17903,We find this elastic property to some extent in all solid bodies.
17904,"If we had the time to deal with the subject at length, we would want to look into many things: the behavior of materials, the general laws of elasticity, the general theory of elasticity, the atomic machinery that determine the elastic properties, and finally the limitations of elastic laws when the forces become so great that plastic flow and fracture occur."
17905,"It would take more time than we have to cover all these subjects in detail, so we will have to leave out some things."
17906,"For example, we will not discuss plasticity or the limitations of the elastic laws."
17907,(We touched on these subjects briefly when we were talking about dislocations in metals.)
17908,"Also, we will not be able to discuss the internal mechanisms of elasticity—so our treatment will not have the completeness we have tried to achieve in the earlier chapters."
17909,Our aim is mainly to give you an acquaintance with some of the ways of dealing with such practical problems as the bending of beams.
17910,"When you push on a piece of material, it “gives”—the material is deformed."
17911,"If the force is small enough, the relative displacements of the various points in the material are proportional to the force—we say the behavior is elastic."
17912,We will discuss only the elastic behavior.
17913,"First, we will write down the fundamental laws of elasticity, and then we will apply them to a number of different situations."
17914,38–1.
17915,We will suppose in all cases that the change in length is a small fraction of the original length.
17916,"As a matter of fact, for materials like wood and steel, the material will break if the change in length is more than a few percent of the original length."
17917,We can figure out how by the following argument.
17918,Suppose that we put two blocks side by side.
17919,"The force per unit area is called the stress, and the stretch per unit length—the fractional stretch—is called the strain."
17920,There is another part to Hooke’s law: When you stretch a block of material in one direction it contracts at right angles to the stretch.
17921,"In crystalline materials the stretches and contractions can be different in different directions, so there can be many more elastic constants."
17922,As usual there are different ways of describing things—some people like to describe the elastic properties of materials by different constants.
17923,The last general law we need is the principle of superposition.
17924,"Since the two laws (38.4) and (38.5) are linear in the forces and in the displacements, superposition will work."
17925,"If you have one set of forces and get some displacements, and then you add a new set of forces and get some additional displacements, the resulting displacements will be the sum of the ones you would get with the two sets of forces acting independently."
17926,Now we have all the general principles—the superposition principle and Eqs.
17927,(38.4) and (38.5)—and that’s all there is to elasticity.
17928,But that is like saying that once you have Newton’s laws that’s all there is to mechanics.
17929,"Or, given Maxwell’s equations, that’s all there is to electricity."
17930,"It is, of course, true that with these principles you have a great deal, because with your present mathematical ability you could go a long way."
17931,"We will, however, work out a few special applications."
17932,As our first example let’s find out what happens to a rectangular block under uniform hydrostatic pressure.
17933,Let’s put a block under water in a pressure tank.
17934,Then there will be a force acting inward on every face of the block proportional to the area (see Fig.
17935,38–2).
17936,"Since the hydrostatic pressure is uniform, the stress (force per unit area) on each face of the block is the same."
17937,We will work out first the change in the length.
17938,The change in length of the block can be thought of as the sum of changes in length that would occur in the three independent problems which are sketched in Fig.
17939,38–3.
17940,Problem 1.
17941,Problem 2.
17942,Problem 3.
17943,The change in the volume under hydrostatic pressure is also of some interest.
17944,(38.9).
17945,We can also see from Eq.
17946,That would allow us to get mechanical energy out of any old block—it would mean that the block was in unstable equilibrium.
17947,If it started to expand it would continue by itself with a release of energy.
17948,Now we want to consider what happens when you put a “shear” strain on something.
17949,By shear strain we mean the kind of distortion shown in Fig.
17950,38–4.
17951,"As a preliminary to this, let us look at the strains in a cube of material subjected to the forces shown in Fig."
17952,38–5.
17953,"Again we can break it up into two problems: the vertical pushes, and the horizontal pulls."
17954,Now suppose we have the same cube and subject it to the shearing forces shown in Fig.
17955,38–6(a).
17956,Note that all the forces have to be equal if there are to be no net torques and the cube is to be in equilibrium.
17957,(Similar forces must also exist in Fig.
17958,"38–4, since the block is in equilibrium."
17959,They are provided through the “glue” that holds the block to the table.)
17960,The cube is then said to be in a state of pure shear.
17961,The internal stresses and strains are the same as we would find in the larger block of material with the forces shown in Fig.
17962,38–6(b).
17963,But this is the problem we have already solved.
17964,The change in length of the diagonal is given by Eq.
17965,38–7.
17966,Using Eq.
17967,From Eq.
17968,"As a last example of the type of situation where the stresses are uniform through the material, let’s consider the problem of a block which is stretched, while it is at the same time constrained so that no lateral contraction can take place."
17969,"(Technically, it’s a little easier to compress it while keeping the sides from bulging out—but it’s the same problem.)"
17970,What happens?
17971,"Well, there must be sideways forces which keep it from changing its thickness—forces we don’t know off-hand but will have to calculate."
17972,"It’s the same kind of problem we have already done, only with a little different algebra."
17973,"We imagine forces on all three sides, as shown in Fig."
17974,"38–8; we calculate the changes in dimensions, and we choose the transverse forces to make the width and height remain constant."
17975,As you can most easily see from Eq.
17976,It is harder to stretch the block when the sides are held—which also means that a block is stronger when the sides are held than when they are not.
17977,Let’s now turn our attention to an example which is more complicated because different parts of the material are stressed by different amounts.
17978,"We consider a twisted rod such as you would find in a drive shaft of some machinery, or in a quartz fiber suspension used in a delicate instrument."
17979,"As you probably know from experiments with the torsion pendulum, the torque on a twisted rod is proportional to the angle—the constant of proportionality obviously depending upon the length of the rod, on the radius of the rod, and on the properties of the material."
17980,The question is: In what way?
17981,We are now in a position to answer this question; it’s just a matter of working out some geometry.
17982,Fig.
17983,"If we want to relate the strains to what we already know, we can think of the rod as being made up of many cylindrical shells and work out separately what happens to each shell."
17984,38–9(b).
17985,"Now if we look at a piece of this cylinder that was originally a small square, we see that it has been distorted into a parallelogram."
17986,"Before leaving the subject of torsion, let us apply what we have just learned to an interesting problem: torsional waves."
17987,"If you take a long rod and suddenly twist one end, a wave of twist works it way along the rod, as sketched in Fig."
17988,38–10(a).
17989,That’s a little more exciting than a steady twist—let’s see whether we can work out what happens.
17990,"When the torsion along the rod is not uniform, we should replace Eq."
17991,38–10(b).
17992,Differentiating Eq.
17993,The effect of this net torque is to give an angular acceleration to the little slice of the rod.
17994,"We worked out in Chapter 19, Vol."
17995,The speed does not depend upon the diameter of the rod.
17996,Torsional waves are a special example of shear waves.
17997,"In general, shear waves are those in which the strains do not change the volume of any part of the material."
17998,"In torsional waves, we have a particular distribution of such shear stresses—namely, distributed on a circle."
17999,"But for any arrangement of shear stresses, waves will propagate with the same speed—the one given in Eq."
18000,(38.32).
18001,"For example, the seismologists find such shear waves travelling in the interior of the earth."
18002,We can have another kind of a wave in the elastic world inside a solid material.
18003,"If you push something, you can start “longitudinal” waves—also called “compressional” waves."
18004,They are like the sound waves in air or in water—the displacements are in the same direction as the wave propagation.
18005,"(At the surfaces of an elastic body there can also be other types of waves—called “Rayleigh waves” or “Love waves.”  In them, the strains are neither purely longitudinal nor purely transverse."
18006,We will not have time to study them.)
18007,"While we’re on the subject of waves, what is the velocity of the pure compressional waves in a large solid body like the earth?"
18008,"We say “large” because the speed of sound in a thick body is different from what it is, for instance, along a thin rod."
18009,By a “thick” body we mean one in which the transverse dimensions are much larger than the wavelength of the sound.
18010,"Then, when we push on the object, it cannot expand sideways—it can only compress in one dimension."
18011,"Fortunately, we have already worked out the special case of the compression of a constrained elastic material."
18012,"We have also worked out in Chapter 47, Vol."
18013,"I, the speed of sound waves in a gas."
18014,(38.20).
18015,One of the most precise ways of measuring the elastic constants of a substance is by measuring the density of the material and the speeds of the two kinds of waves.
18016,"It is, incidentally, by measuring the difference in the arrival times of the two kinds of waves from an earthquake that a seismologist can estimate—even from the signals at only one station—the distance to the quake."
18017,We want now to look at another practical matter—the bending of a rod or a beam.
18018,What are the forces when we bend a bar of some arbitrary cross section?
18019,"We will work it out thinking of a bar with a circular cross section, but our answer will be good for any shape."
18020,"To save time, however, we will cut some corners, so our theory we will work out is only approximate."
18021,Our results will be correct only when the radius of the bend is much larger than the thickness of the beam.
18022,Suppose you grab the two ends of a straight bar and bend it into some curve like the one shown in Fig.
18023,38–11.
18024,What goes on inside the bar?
18025,"Well, if it is curved, that means that the material on the inside of the curve is compressed and the material on the outside is stretched."
18026,There is some surface which goes along more or less parallel to the axis of the bar that is neither stretched nor compressed.
18027,This is called the neutral surface.
18028,You would expect this surface to be near the “middle” of the cross section.
18029,"It can be shown (but we won’t do it here) that, for small bending of simple beams, the neutral surface goes through the “center of gravity” of the cross section."
18030,This is true only for “pure” bending—if you are not stretching or compressing the beam at the same time.
18031,"For pure bending, then, a thin transverse slice of the bar is distorted as shown in Fig."
18032,38–12(a).
18033,"The material below the neutral surface has a compressional strain which is proportional to the distance from the neutral surface; and the material above is stretched, also in proportion to its distance from the neutral surface."
18034,Now let’s look at the forces that would produce such a strain.
18035,The forces acting on the little segment drawn in Fig.
18036,38–12 are shown in the figure.
18037,"If we think of any transverse cut, the forces acting across it are one way above the neutral surface and the other way below."
18038,We can compute the total moment by integrating the force times the distance from the neutral surface for one of the faces of the segment of Fig.
18039,"In other words, if you want the stiffest possible beam with a given amount of, say, aluminum, you want to put as much of it as possible as far as you can from the neutral surface, to make a large moment of inertia."
18040,"You can’t carry this to an extreme, however, because then the thing will not curve as we have supposed—it will buckle or twist and become weaker again."
18041,But now you see why structural beams are made in the form of an I or an H—as shown in Fig.
18042,38–13.
18043,38–14.
18044,(By “cantilevered” we simply mean that the beam is supported in such a way that both the position and the slope are fixed at one end—it is stuck into a cement wall.)
18045,What is the shape of the beam?
18046,We’ll work it out only for small deflections.
18047,We will also assume that the beam is long in comparison with its cross section.
18048,(You can put in the beam weight yourself if you want.)
18049,That is the shape of the beam.
18050,"In deriving our approximate beam theory, we have assumed that the cross section of the beam did not change when the beam was bent."
18051,"When the thickness of the beam is small compared to the radius of curvature, the cross section changes very little and our result is O.K."
18052,"In general, however, this effect cannot be neglected, as you can easily demonstrate for yourselves by bending a soft-rubber eraser in your fingers."
18053,"If the cross section was originally rectangular, you will find that when it is bent it bulges at the bottom (see Fig."
18054,38–15).
18055,"This happens because when we compress the bottom, the material expands sideways—as described by Poisson’s ratio."
18056,"Rubber is easy to bend or stretch, but it is somewhat like a liquid in that it’s hard to change the volume—as shows up nicely when you bend the eraser."
18057,"We want now to use our beam theory to understand the theory of the “buckling” of beams, or columns, or rods."
18058,Consider the situation sketched in Fig.
18059,38–16 in which a rod that would normally be straight is held in its bent shape by two opposite forces that push on the ends of the rod.
18060,We would like to calculate the shape of the rod and the magnitude of the forces on the ends.
18061,"So for small deflections, the curve of such a bent beam is a sine curve."
18062,"If the bending is small, this is just twice the unbent length of the rod."
18063,"We have, then, the following thing physically."
18064,"(38.46), there will be no bending at all."
18065,Another place where the buckling force is most important is in space rockets.
18066,"On one hand, the rocket must be able to hold its own weight on the launching pad and endure the stresses during acceleration; on the other hand, it is important to keep the weight of the structure to a minimum, so that the payload and fuel capacity may be made as large as possible."
18067,Actually a beam will not necessarily collapse completely when the force exceeds the Euler force.
18068,(38.38) that we have neglected.
18069,"To find the forces for a large bending of the beam, we have to go back to the exact equation, Eq."
18070,"Equation (38.44) has a rather simple geometrical property.2 It’s a little complicated to work out, but rather interesting."
18071,See Fig.
18072,38–17.
18073,(38.45).
18074,Everything is O.K.]
18075,Now it may or may not delight you to know that Eq.
18076,"We learned way back in Chapter 9, Vol."
18077,In the last chapter we talked about the distortions of particular elastic objects.
18078,In this chapter we want to look at what can happen in general inside an elastic material.
18079,We would like to be able to describe the conditions of stress and strain inside some big glob of jello which is twisted and squashed in some complicated way.
18080,"To do this, we need to be able to describe the local strain at every point in an elastic body; we can do it by giving a set of six numbers—which are the components of a symmetric tensor—for each point."
18081,"Earlier, we spoke of the stress tensor (Chapter 31); now we need the tensor of strain."
18082,Imagine that we start with the material initially unstrained and watch the motion of a small speck of “dirt” embedded in the material when the strain is applied.
18083,39–1.
18084,Let’s look first at a simple situation in which the strain is constant over the material—so we have what is called a homogeneous strain.
18085,"Suppose, for instance, that we have a block of material and we stretch it uniformly."
18086,39–2.
18087,(You will see shortly why we use a double subscript.)
18088,We need to be able to describe also the shear-type strains.
18089,Suppose we imagine a little cube marked out in the initially undisturbed jello.
18090,"When the jello is pushed out of shape, this cube may get changed into a parallelogram, as sketched in Fig."
18091,39–4.
18092,There is no strain at all—just a rotation in space.
18093,There is no distortion of the material; the relative positions of all the atoms are not changed at all.
18094,We must somehow make our definitions so that pure rotations are not included in our definitions of a shear strain.
18095,You remember (see Chapter 31) that the general characteristic of a tensor is that the terms transform like the products of the components of two vectors.
18096,"When the strains are not homogeneous, any piece of the jello may also get somewhat twisted—there will be a local rotation."
18097,"Now that we have described the strains, we want to relate them to the internal forces—the stresses in the material."
18098,"For each small piece of the material, we assume Hooke’s law holds and write that the stresses are proportional to the strains."
18099,They are constants if the material itself is homogeneous.
18100,We can call it the tensor of elasticity.
18101,"There will be all kinds of distortion, and the thing will settle down with some twisted shape."
18102,What are the displacements?
18103,You can see that it is a complicated problem.
18104,"If you knew the strains, you could find the stresses from Eq."
18105,(39.12)—or vice versa.
18106,But the stresses and strains you end up with at any point depend on what happens in all the rest of the material.
18107,The easiest way to get at the problem is by thinking of the energy.
18108,"Now when a body is in equilibrium, this internal energy must be at a minimum."
18109,In Chapter 19 we gave some of the general ideas of the calculus of variations that are used in tackling minimization problems like this.
18110,We cannot go into the problem in any more detail here.
18111,What we are mainly interested in now is what we can say about the general properties of the tensor of elasticity.
18112,"There are, however, usually many fewer than this."
18113,Let’s look at the special case of a cubic crystal.
18114,Now a cubic crystal has certain symmetries.
18115,"(39.15), the energy wouldn’t change."
18116,A cubic crystal has the property that it is symmetric under a reflection about any plane perpendicular to one of the axes.
18117,This can happen only if both are zero.
18118,"It is zero only when there is one, or three."
18119,"For an isotropic—that is, noncrystalline—material, the symmetry is still higher."
18120,"“That’s easy,” you say."
18121,It’s just Hooke’s law.
18122,Comparing Eq.
18123,(39.20) with Eq.
18124,(39.19) is indeed true.
18125,"You also see that the elastic properties of an isotropic material are completely given by two constants, as we said in the last chapter."
18126,We have pointed out that for an elastic body in equilibrium the internal stresses adjust themselves to make the energy a minimum.
18127,Now we take a look at what happens when the internal forces are not in equilibrium.
18128,See Fig.
18129,39–5.
18130,We can think of this force as being made up of two parts.
18131,When the piece is not in equilibrium—if it is moving—the sum of the internal and external forces is equal to the mass times the acceleration.
18132,We can now combine Eqs.
18133,We have a surface integral related to a volume integral—and that reminds us of something we learned in electricity.
18134,"In other words, we can change Eq."
18135,The theory of the motions inside a solid works this way.
18136,From the strains we can get the stresses from Eq.
18137,(39.12).
18138,(39.31).
18139,"Putting everything together, we get the horrible equation of motion for an elastic solid."
18140,We will just write down the results that come out for an isotropic material.
18141,Adding it would add nothing new.
18142,We have proved once more that isotropic material has only two elastic constants.
18143,For materials whose elastic properties are everywhere the same we can see what the general solutions look like in the following way.
18144,"You will remember that any vector field can be written as the sum of two vectors: one whose divergence is zero, and the other whose curl is zero."
18145,In a similar way—by taking the curl of Eq.
18146,"If we wished to know the static stresses in an isotropic material, we could, in principle, find them by solving Eq."
18147,This is somewhat more difficult to do than the corresponding problems in electromagnetism.
18148,"It is more difficult, first, because the equations are a little more difficult to handle, and second, because the shape of the elastic bodies we are likely to be interested in are usually much more complicated."
18149,"In electromagnetism, we are often interested in solving Maxwell’s equations around relatively simple geometric shapes such as cylinders, spheres, and so on, since these are convenient shapes for electrical devices."
18150,"In elasticity, the objects we would like to analyze may have quite complicated shapes—like a crane hook, or an automobile crankshaft, or the rotor of a gas turbine."
18151,"Such problems can sometimes be worked out approximately by numerical methods, using the minimum energy principle we mentioned earlier."
18152,"Another way is to use a model of the object and measure the internal strains experimentally, using polarized light."
18153,"It works this way: When a transparent isotropic material—for example, a clear plastic like lucite—is put under stress, it becomes birefringent."
18154,"If you put polarized light through it, the plane of polarization will be rotated by an amount related to the stress: by measuring the rotation, you can measure the stress."
18155,Figure 39–6 shows how such a setup might look.
18156,Figure 39–7 is a photograph of a photoelastic model of a complicated shape under stress.
18157,"In all that has been said so far, we have assumed that stress is proportional to strain; in general, that is not true."
18158,Figure 39–8 shows a typical stress-strain curve for a ductile material.
18159,"For small strains, the stress is proportional to the strain."
18160,"Eventually, however, after a certain point, the relationship between stress and strain begins to deviate from a straight line."
18161,For many materials—the ones we would call “brittle”—the object breaks for strains only a little above the point where the curve starts to bend over.
18162,"In general, there are other complications in the stress-strain relationship."
18163,"For example, if you strain an object, the stresses may be high at first, but decrease slowly with time."
18164,"Also if you go to high stresses, but still not to the “breaking” point, when you lower the strain the stress will return along a different curve."
18165,The stress at which a material will break varies widely from one material to another.
18166,Some materials will break when the maximum tensile stress reaches a certain value.
18167,Other materials will fail when the maximum shear stress reaches a certain value.
18168,Chalk is an example of a material which is much weaker in tension than in shear.
18169,"If you pull on the ends of a piece of blackboard chalk, the chalk will break perpendicular to the direction of the applied stress, as shown in Fig."
18170,39–9(a).
18171,It breaks perpendicular to the applied force because it is only a bunch of particles packed together which are easily pulled apart.
18172,"The material is, however, much harder to shear, because the particles get in each other’s way."
18173,Now you will remember that when we had a rod in torsion there was a shear all around it.
18174,A photograph of a piece of chalk broken in this way is shown in Fig.
18175,39–9(b).
18176,The chalk breaks where the material is in maximum tension.
18177,Other materials behave in strange and complicated ways.
18178,"The more complicated the materials are, the more interesting their behavior."
18179,"If we take a sheet of “Saran-Wrap” and crumple it up into a ball and throw it on the table, it slowly unfolds itself and returns toward its original flat form."
18180,"At first sight, we might be tempted to think that it is inertia which prevents it from returning to its original form."
18181,"However, a simple calculation shows that the inertia is several orders of magnitude too small to account for the effect."
18182,"There appear to be two important competing effects: “something” inside the material “remembers” the shape it had initially and “tries” to get back there, but something else “prefers” the new shape and “resists” the return to the old shape."
18183,"We will not attempt to describe the mechanism at play in the Saran plastic, but you can get an idea of how such an effect might come about from the following model."
18184,"Suppose you imagine a material made of long, flexible, but strong, fibers mixed together with some hollow cells filled with a viscous liquid."
18185,Imagine also that there are narrow pathways from one cell to the next so the liquid can leak slowly from a cell to its neighbor.
18186,"When we crumple a sheet of this stuff, we distort the long fibers, squeezing the liquid out of the cells in one place and forcing it into other cells which are being stretched."
18187,"When we let go, the long fibers try to return to their original shape."
18188,"But to do this, they have to force the liquid back to its original location—which will happen relatively slowly because of the viscosity."
18189,The forces we apply in crumpling the sheet are much larger than the forces exerted by the fibers.
18190,"We can crumple the sheet quickly, but it will return more slowly."
18191,"It is undoubtedly a combination of large stiff molecules and smaller, movable ones in the Saran-Wrap that is responsible for its behavior."
18192,This idea also fits with the fact that the material returns more quickly to its original shape when it’s warmed up than when it’s cold—the heat increases the mobility (decreases the viscosity) of the smaller molecules.
18193,"Although we have been discussing how Hooke’s law breaks down, the remarkable thing is perhaps not that Hooke’s law breaks down for large strains but that it should be so generally true."
18194,We can get some idea of why this might be by looking at the strain energy in a material.
18195,To say that the stress is proportional to the strain is the same thing as saying that the strain energy varies as the square of the strain.
18196,"There is, however, no reason why this should be true for compressions and tensions.]"
18197,The thing we have not explained is why materials usually break soon after the higher-order terms become significant.
18198,"As our last topic on elasticity we would like to show how one could try to calculate the elastic constants of a material, starting with some knowledge of the properties of the atoms which make up the material."
18199,We will take only the simple case of an ionic cubic crystal like sodium chloride.
18200,"When a crystal is strained, its volume or its shape is changed."
18201,Such changes result in an increase in the potential energy of the crystal.
18202,"To calculate the change in strain energy, we have to know where each atom goes."
18203,"In complicated crystals, the atoms will rearrange themselves in the lattice in very complicated ways to make the total energy as small as possible."
18204,This makes the computation of the strain energy rather difficult.
18205,"In the case of a simple cubic crystal, however, it is easy to see what will happen."
18206,The distortions inside the crystal will be geometrically similar to the distortions of the outside boundaries of the crystal.
18207,We can calculate the elastic constants for a cubic crystal in the following way.
18208,"First, we assume some force law between each pair of atoms in the crystal."
18209,"Then, we calculate the change in the internal energy of the crystal when it is distorted from its equilibrium shape."
18210,This gives us a relation between the energy and the strains which is quadratic in all the strains.
18211,Comparing the energy obtained this way with Eq.
18212,"For our example we will assume a simple force law: that the force between neighboring atoms is a central force, by which we mean that it acts along the line between the two atoms."
18213,"We would expect the forces in ionic crystals to be like this, since they are just primarily Coulomb forces."
18214,"(The forces of covalent bonds are usually more complicated, since they can exert a sideways push on a nearby atom; we will leave out this complication.)"
18215,We are also going to include only the forces between each atom and its nearest and next-nearest neighbors.
18216,"In other words, we will make an approximation which neglects all forces beyond the next-nearest neighbor."
18217,39–10(a).
18218,"Since we are only interested in the elastic coefficients which apply to small strains, and therefore only want the terms in the energy which vary quadratically with the strains, we can imagine that the force between each atom pair varies linearly with the displacements."
18219,"We can then imagine that each pair of atoms is joined by a linear spring, as drawn in Fig."
18220,39–10(b).
18221,(We could come back later and make them different after we have seen how the calculations go.)
18222,"If we pick one atom as our origin, the displacement of every other atom is given by equations like Eq."
18223,39–11.
18224,(39.45).
18225,(39.13).
18226,"The energy we have calculated is the energy associated with one atom, or rather, it is twice the energy per atom, since one-half of the energy of each spring should be assigned to each of the two atoms it joins."
18227,(39.13).
18228,(39.13).
18229,"It turns out—as you can perhaps see from the way the calculations went—that these terms are always equal for a cubic crystal, no matter how many force terms are taken into account, provided only that the forces act along the line joining each pair of atoms—that is, so long as the forces between atoms are like springs and don’t have a sideways part such as you might get from a cantilevered beam (and you do get in covalent bonds)."
18230,We can check this conclusion with the experimental measurements of the elastic constants.
18231,"The reason is that in metals like sodium and potassium the interatomic forces are not along the line joining the atoms, as we assumed in our model."
18232,"Diamond does not obey the law either, because the forces in diamond are covalent forces and have some directional properties—the bonds would prefer to be at the tetrahedral angle."
18233,"The subject of the flow of fluids, and particularly of water, fascinates everybody."
18234,"We can all remember, as children, playing in the bathtub or in mud puddles with the strange stuff."
18235,"As we get older, we watch streams, waterfalls, and whirlpools, and we are fascinated by this substance which seems almost alive relative to solids."
18236,The behavior of fluids is in many ways very unexpected and interesting—it is the subject of this chapter and the next.
18237,The efforts of a child trying to dam a small stream flowing in the street and his surprise at the strange way the water works its way out has its analog in our attempts over the years to understand the flow of fluids.
18238,We have tried to dam the water up—in our understanding—by getting the laws and the equations that describe the flow.
18239,We will describe these attempts in this chapter.
18240,"In the next chapter, we will describe the unique way in which water has broken through the dam and escaped our attempts to understand it."
18241,We suppose that the elementary properties of water are already known to you.
18242,The main property that distinguishes a fluid from a solid is that a fluid cannot maintain a shear stress for any length of time.
18243,"If a shear is applied to a fluid, it will move under the shear."
18244,Thicker liquids like honey move less easily than fluids like air or water.
18245,The measure of the ease with which a fluid yields is its viscosity.
18246,In this chapter we will consider only situations in which the viscous effects can be ignored.
18247,The effects of viscosity will be taken up in the next chapter.
18248,"We begin by considering hydrostatics, the theory of liquids at rest."
18249,"When liquids are at rest, there are no shear forces (even for viscous liquids)."
18250,"The law of hydrostatics, therefore, is that the stresses are always normal to any surface inside the fluid."
18251,The normal force per unit area is called the pressure.
18252,From the fact that there is no shear in a static fluid it follows that the pressure stress is the same in all directions (Fig.
18253,40-1).
18254,"We will let you entertain yourself by proving that if there is no shear on any plane in a fluid, the pressure must be the same in any direction."
18255,The pressure in a fluid may vary from place to place.
18256,"For example, in a static fluid at the earth’s surface the pressure will vary with height because of the weight of the fluid."
18257,"This relation is familiar to you, but we will now derive a more general result of which it is a special case."
18258,"If we take a small cube of water, what is the net force on it from the pressure?"
18259,"Since the pressure at any place is the same in all directions, there can be a net force per unit volume only because the pressure varies from one point to another."
18260,If there are other forces in addition—such as gravity—then the pressure must balance them to give equilibrium.
18261,"In general, it has no solution."
18262,"If the density varies in space in an arbitrary way, there is no way for the forces to be in balance, and the fluid cannot be in static equilibrium."
18263,Convection currents will start up.
18264,"However, we will leave the subject of hydrostatics because it is not nearly so interesting as the situation when fluids are in motion."
18265,"First, we will discuss fluid motions in a purely abstract, theoretical way and then consider special examples."
18266,"To describe the motion of a fluid, we must give its properties at every point."
18267,"For example, at different places, the water (let us call the fluid “water”) is moving with different velocities."
18268,"To specify the character of the flow, therefore, we must give the three components of velocity at every point and for any time."
18269,"If we can find the equations that determine the velocity, then we would know how the liquid moves at all times."
18270,"The velocity, however, is not the only property that the fluid has which varies from point to point."
18271,We have just discussed the variation of the pressure from point to point.
18272,And there are still other variables.
18273,There may also be a variation of density from point to point.
18274,"There may be a temperature which varies from point to point, or a magnetic field, and so on."
18275,So the number of fields needed to describe the complete situation will depend on how complicated the problem is.
18276,"There are interesting phenomena when currents and magnetism play a dominant part in determining the behavior of the fluid; the subject is called magnetohydrodynamics, and great attention is being paid to it at the present time."
18277,"However, we are not going to consider these more complicated situations because there are already interesting phenomena at a lower level of complexity, and even the more elementary level will be complicated enough."
18278,"We will take the situation where there is no magnetic field and no conductivity, and we will not worry about the temperature because we will suppose that the density and pressure determine in a unique manner the temperature at any point."
18279,"As a matter of fact, we will reduce the complexity of our work by making the assumption that the density is a constant—we imagine that the fluid is essentially incompressible."
18280,"Putting it another way, we are supposing that the variations of pressure are so small that the changes in density produced thereby are negligible."
18281,"If that is not the case, we would encounter phenomena additional to the ones we will be discussing here—for example, the propagation of sound or of shock waves."
18282,"We can say that if the velocities of flow are much less than the speed of a sound wave in the fluid, we do not have to worry about variations in density."
18283,The escape that water makes in our attempts to understand it is not related to the approximation of constant density.
18284,The complications that do permit the escape will be discussed in the next chapter.
18285,In the general theory of fluids one must begin with an equation of state for the fluid which connects the pressure to the density.
18286,"The next relation expresses the conservation of matter—if matter flows away from a point, there must be a decrease in the amount left behind."
18287,We have had a similar relation in electricity.
18288,We also know from electricity that the divergence of such a quantity gives the rate of decrease of the density per unit time.
18289,(The hydrodynamic equations are often closely analogous to the electrodynamic equations; that’s why we studied electrodynamics first.
18290,Some people argue the other way; they think that one should study hydrodynamics first so that it will be easier to understand electricity afterwards.
18291,But electrodynamics is really much easier than hydrodynamics.)
18292,We will get our next equation from Newton’s law which tells us how the velocity changes because of the forces.
18293,The mass of an element of volume of the fluid times its acceleration must be equal to the force on the element.
18294,Then there are the “external” forces which act at a distance—like gravity or electricity.
18295,"Then there is another “internal” force per unit volume, which is due to the fact that in a flowing fluid there can also be a shearing stress."
18296,"When we drop the viscosity term, we will be making an approximation which describes some ideal stuff rather than real water."
18297,"John von Neumann was well aware of the tremendous difference between what happens when you don’t have the viscous terms and when you do, and he was also aware that, during most of the development of hydrodynamics until about 1900, almost the main interest was in solving beautiful mathematical problems with this approximation which had almost nothing to do with real fluids."
18298,He characterized the theorist who made such analyses as a man who studied “dry water.” Such analyses leave out an essential property of the fluid.
18299,It is because we are leaving this property out of our calculations in this chapter that we have given it the title “The Flow of Dry Water.”  We are postponing a discussion of real water to the next chapter.
18300,(40.4) everything we need except an expression for the acceleration.
18301,It is not—and for a rather subtle reason.
18302,What we need is how fast the velocity changes for a particular piece of fluid.
18303,Imagine that we mark one of the drops of water with a colored speck so we can watch it.
18304,If the drop is moving along some path as sketched in Fig.
18305,"As an example, water flowing in a circle at a constant speed is accelerating even though the velocity at a given point is not changing."
18306,"The reason is, of course, that the velocity of a particular piece of water which is initially at one point on the circle has a different direction a moment later; there is a centripetal acceleration."
18307,The rest of our theory is just mathematical—finding solutions of the equation of motion we get by putting the acceleration (40.5) into Eq.
18308,(40.4).
18309,(40.6) and (40.8) are equivalent by checking that the components of the two sides of the equation are equal—and making use of (40.7).
18310,"If the vorticity is zero everywhere, we say that the flow is irrotational."
18311,We have already defined in Section 3-5 a thing called the circulation of a vector field.
18312,Try to see if you can prove that.
18313,"If we are interested only in the velocity field, we can eliminate the pressure from our equations."
18314,Taking the curl of both sides of Eq.
18315,Using Eq.
18316,You see how these equations contain all the machinery for calculating the flow.
18317,"Note, however, that this procedure gives the velocity field only; we have lost all information about the pressure."
18318,We point out one special consequence of our equation.
18319,We have a solution to the equation; the flow is permanently irrotational.
18320,"If a flow was started with zero rotation, it would always have zero rotation."
18321,We will come back to them and look at some special problems later.
18322,"Now we want to return to the equation of motion, Eq."
18323,"(40.8), but limit ourselves to situations in which the flow is “steady.” By steady flow we mean that at any one place in the fluid the velocity never changes."
18324,The fluid at any point is always replaced by new fluid moving in exactly the same way.
18325,"In the same way that we drew “field lines” in magnetostatics, we can now draw lines which are always tangent to the fluid velocity as shown in Fig."
18326,40-5.
18327,These lines are called streamlines.
18328,"For steady flow, they are evidently the actual paths of fluid particles."
18329,"(In unsteady flow the streamline pattern changes in time, and the streamline pattern at any instant does not represent the path of a fluid particle.)"
18330,A steady flow does not mean that nothing is happening—atoms in the fluid are moving and changing their velocities.
18331,"Now in steady flow all displacements are along streamlines, so Eq."
18332,The constant may in general be different for different streamlines; all we know is that the left-hand side of Eq.
18333,(40.13) is the same all along a given streamline.
18334,(40.13) except that now the constant has the same value throughout the fluid.
18335,The theorem of Bernoulli is in fact nothing more than a statement of the conservation of energy.
18336,A conservation theorem such as this gives us a lot of information about a flow without our actually having to solve the detailed equations.
18337,Bernoulli’s theorem is so important and so simple that we would like to show you how it can be derived in a way that is different from the formal calculations we have just used.
18338,Imagine a bundle of adjacent streamlines which form a stream tube as sketched in Fig.
18339,40-6.
18340,"Since the walls of the tube consist of streamlines, no fluid flows out through the wall."
18341,40-6(b)].
18342,Now we calculate the work done by the fluid pressure.
18343,"The internal energy might correspond, for example, to the thermal energy in a compressible fluid, or to chemical energy."
18344,All these quantities can vary from point to point.
18345,"If the fluid is incompressible, the internal energy term is the same on both sides, and we get again that Eq."
18346,(40.14) holds along any streamline.
18347,We consider now some simple examples in which the Bernoulli integral gives us a description of the flow.
18348,"Suppose we have water flowing out of a hole near the bottom of a tank, as drawn in Fig."
18349,40-7.
18350,(We could make a more accurate calculation if we wished.)
18351,"Now we write our Bernoulli equation for a streamline, such as the one shown in the figure."
18352,"It is not too surprising, since the water at the exit gains kinetic energy at the expense of the potential energy of the water at the top."
18353,"Do not get the idea, however, that you can figure out the rate that the fluid flows out of the tank by multiplying this velocity by the area of the hole."
18354,The fluid velocities as the jet leaves the hole are not all parallel to each other but have components inward toward the center of the stream—the jet is converging.
18355,"After the jet has gone a little way, the contraction stops and the velocities do become parallel."
18356,So the total flow is the velocity times the area at that point.
18357,"The reduced effective area of the discharge varies for different shapes of discharge tubes, and experimental contractions are available as tables of efflux coefficients."
18358,"If the discharge tube is re-entrant, as shown in Fig."
18359,We will give just a hint of how the proof goes.
18360,"We have used the conservation of energy to get the velocity, Eq."
18361,"(40.18), but there is also momentum conservation to consider."
18362,"Since there is an outflow of momentum in the discharge jet, there must be a force applied over the cross section of the discharge tube."
18363,Where does the force come from?
18364,The force must come from the pressure on the walls.
18365,"As long as the efflux hole is small and away from the walls, the fluid velocity near the walls of the tank will be very small."
18366,"Therefore, the pressure on every face is almost exactly the same as the static pressure in a fluid at rest—from Eq."
18367,(40.14).
18368,"Then the static pressure at any point on the side of the tank must be matched by an equal pressure at the point on the opposite wall, except at the points on the wall opposite the charge tube."
18369,We cannot use this method for a discharge hole like that shown in Fig.
18370,"40-7, however, because the velocity increase along the wall right near the discharge area gives a pressure fall which we are not able to calculate."
18371,"Let’s look at another example—a horizontal pipe with changing cross section, as shown in Fig."
18372,"40-9, with water flowing in one end and out the other."
18373,"The conservation of energy, namely Bernoulli’s formula, says that the pressure is lower in the constricted area where the velocity is higher."
18374,We can easily demonstrate this effect by measuring the pressure at different cross sections with small vertical columns of water attached to the flow tube through holes small enough so that they do not disturb the flow.
18375,The pressure is then measured by the height of water in these vertical columns.
18376,The pressure is found to be less at the constriction than it is on either side.
18377,"If the area beyond the constriction comes back to the same value it had before the constriction, the pressure rises again."
18378,"Bernoulli’s formula would predict that the pressure downstream of the constriction should be the same as it was upstream, but actually it is noticeably less."
18379,"The reason that our prediction is wrong is that we have neglected the frictional, viscous forces which cause a pressure drop along the tube."
18380,Despite this pressure drop the pressure is definitely lower at the constriction (because of the increased speed) than it is on either side of it—as predicted by Bernoulli.
18381,So the water accelerates in going from the wide to the narrow part.
18382,The force that gives this acceleration comes from the drop in pressure.
18383,We can check our results with another simple demonstration.
18384,Suppose we have on a tank a discharge tube which throws a jet of water upward as shown in Fig.
18385,40-10.
18386,"Experimentally, it falls somewhat short."
18387,"Our prediction is roughly right, but again viscous friction which has not been included in our energy conservation formula has resulted in a loss of energy."
18388,Have you ever held two pieces of paper close together and tried to blow them apart?
18389,Try it!
18390,They come together.
18391,"The reason, of course, is that the air has a higher speed going through the constricted space between the sheets than it does when it gets outside."
18392,"The pressure between the sheets is lower than atmospheric pressure, so they come together rather than separating."
18393,"The divergence of the electric field is zero when there are no charges, and the curl of the electrostatic field is always zero."
18394,"The curl of the magnetostatic field is zero if there are no currents, and the divergence of the magnetic field is always zero."
18395,"Therefore, Eqs."
18396,"As a matter of fact, we have already solved the problem of the flow of a fluid past a sphere, as an electrostatic analogy, in Section 12-5."
18397,The electrostatic analog is a uniform electric field plus a dipole field.
18398,The dipole field is so adjusted that the flow velocity normal to the surface of the sphere is zero.
18399,The same problem for the flow past a cylinder can be worked out in a similar way by using a suitable line dipole with a uniform flow field.
18400,This solution holds for a situation in which the fluid velocity at large distances is constant—both in magnitude and direction.
18401,The solution is sketched in Fig.
18402,40-11(a).
18403,There is another solution for the flow around a cylinder when the conditions are such that the fluid at large distances moves in circles around the cylinder.
18404,"The flow is, then, circular everywhere, as in Fig."
18405,40-11(b).
18406,How can there be circulation without a curl?
18407,We saw the same thing when we found the magnetic field around a wire.
18408,The velocity field in an irrotational circulation around a cylinder is precisely the same as the magnetic field around a wire.
18409,There is a nice demonstration of a fluid circulating around a hole.
18410,You take a transparent cylindrical tank with a drain hole in the center of the bottom.
18411,"You fill it with water, stir up some circulation with a stick, and pull the drain plug."
18412,You get the pretty effect shown in Fig.
18413,40-12.
18414,(You’ve seen a similar thing many times in the bathtub!)
18415,"From the theory, we can calculate the shape of the inner surface of the water."
18416,As a particle of the water moves inward it picks up speed.
18417,From Eq.
18418,"The air-water surface is all at atmospheric pressure, so it must have—from Eq."
18419,"An interesting point—which is not true in general but is true for incompressible, irrotational flow—is that if we have one solution and a second solution, then the sum is also a solution."
18420,This is true because the equations in (40.19) are linear.
18421,"The complete equations of hydrodynamics, Eqs."
18422,"(40.9), (40.10), and (40.11), are not linear, which makes a vast difference."
18423,"For the irrotational flow about the cylinder, however, we can superpose the flow of Fig."
18424,40-11(a) on the flow of Fig.
18425,40-11(b) and get the new flow pattern shown in Fig.
18426,40-11(c).
18427,This flow is of special interest.
18428,The flow velocity is higher on the upper side of the cylinder than on the lower side.
18429,The pressures are therefore lower on the upper side than on the lower side.
18430,"So when we have a combination of a circulation around a cylinder and a net horizontal flow, there is a net vertical force on the cylinder—it is called a lift force."
18431,"Of course, if there is no circulation, there is no net force on any body according to our theory of “dry” water."
18432,We have already written down the general equations for the flow of an incompressible fluid when there may be vorticity.
18433,"First, imagine that in the fluid we were to draw vortex lines rather than streamlines."
18434,Now Helmholtz described III in words by the following statement: the vortex lines move with the fluid.
18435,"This means that if you were to mark the fluid particles along some vortex lines—by coloring them with ink, for example—then as the fluid moves and carries those particles along, they will always mark the new positions of the vortex lines."
18436,"In whatever way the atoms of the liquid move, the vortex lines move with them."
18437,That is one way to describe the laws.
18438,It also suggests a method for solving any problems.
18439,If we are given the flow pattern at one instant we can in principle calculate it for all subsequent times.
18440,We have the general solution for nonviscous flow.
18441,"We would like to show how Helmholtz’s statement—and, therefore, III—can be at least partly understood."
18442,It is really just the law of conservation of angular momentum applied to the fluid.
18443,"Suppose we imagine a small cylinder of the liquid whose axis is parallel to the vortex lines, as in Fig."
18444,40-13(a).
18445,"At some time later, this same piece of fluid will be somewhere else."
18446,Generally it will occupy a cylinder with a different diameter and be in a different place.
18447,"It may also have a different orientation, say as in Fig."
18448,40-13(b).
18449,"If, however, the diameter has decreased as shown in Fig."
18450,"40-13, the length will have increased to keep the volume constant (since we are assuming an incompressible fluid)."
18451,"Also, since the vortex lines are stuck with the material, their density will go up as the cross-sectional area goes down."
18452,"Now notice that with zero viscosity all the forces on the surface of the cylindrical volume (or any volume, for that matter) are perpendicular to the surface."
18453,"The pressure forces can cause the volume to be moved from place to place, or can cause it to change shape; but with no tangential forces the magnitude of the angular momentum of the material inside cannot change."
18454,(40.21).
18455,Helmholtz’s statement—which is equivalent to III—is just a consequence of the fact that in the absence of viscosity the angular momentum of an element of the fluid cannot change.
18456,There is a nice demonstration of a moving vortex which is made with the simple apparatus of Fig.
18457,40-14.
18458,"If you give a sharp blow on the rubber diaphragm with your hand, a vortex ring is projected out of the hole."
18459,"By the delay in the effect, you can tell that “something” is travelling at a finite speed."
18460,You can see better what is going on if you first blow some smoke into the box.
18461,Then you see the vortex as a beautiful round “smoke ring.”
18462,"The smoke ring is a torus-shaped bundle of vortex lines, as shown in  Fig."
18463,40-15(a).
18464,"We can understand the forward motion of the ring in the following way: The circulating velocity around the bottom of the ring extends up to the top of the ring, having there a forward motion."
18465,We must now mention a serious difficulty.
18466,We have already noted that Eq.
18467,"Yet, in our simple demonstration with the drum, we can generate a vortex ring starting with air which was initially at rest."
18468,"Also, we all know that we can start some vorticity in a lake with a paddle."
18469,"Clearly, we must go to a theory of “wet” water to get a complete understanding of the behavior of a fluid."
18470,Another feature of the dry water theory which is incorrect is the supposition we make regarding the flow at the boundary between it and the surface of a solid.
18471,When we discussed the flow past a cylinder—as in Fig.
18472,"40-11, for example—we permitted the fluid to slide along the surface of the solid."
18473,"In our theory, the velocity at a solid surface could have any value depending on how it got started, and we did not consider any “friction” between the fluid and the solid."
18474,"It is an experimental fact, however, that the velocity of a real fluid always goes to zero at the surface of a solid object."
18475,"Therefore, our solution for the cylinder, with or without circulation, is wrong—as is our result regarding the generation of vorticity."
18476,We will tell you about the more correct theories in the next chapter.
18477,"In the last chapter we discussed the behavior of water, disregarding the phenomenon of viscosity."
18478,"Now we would like to discuss the phenomena of the flow of fluids, including the effects of viscosity."
18479,We want to look at the real behavior of fluids.
18480,We will describe qualitatively the actual behavior of the fluids under various different circumstances so that you will get some feel for the subject.
18481,"Although you will see some complicated equations and hear about some complicated things, it is not our purpose that you should learn all these things."
18482,"This is, in a sense, a “cultural” chapter which will give you some idea of the way the world is."
18483,"There is only one item which is worth learning, and that is the simple definition of viscosity which we will come to in a moment."
18484,The rest is only for your entertainment.
18485,But in real fluids it is almost never true that we can neglect the internal friction that we call viscosity; most of the interesting things that happen come from it in one way or another.
18486,"For example, we saw that in “dry” water the circulation never changes—if there is none to start out with, there will never be any."
18487,"Yet, circulation in fluids is an everyday occurrence."
18488,We must fix up our theory.
18489,We begin with an important experimental fact.
18490,When we worked out the flow of “dry” water around or past a cylinder—the so-called “potential flow”—we had no reason not to permit the water to have a velocity tangent to the surface; only the normal component had to be zero.
18491,We took no account of the possibility that there might be a shear force between the liquid and the solid.
18492,"It turns out—although it is not at all self-evident—that in all circumstances where it has been experimentally checked, the velocity of a fluid is exactly zero at the surface of a solid."
18493,"You have noticed, no doubt, that the blade of a fan will collect a thin layer of dust—and that it is still there after the fan has been churning up the air."
18494,You can see the same effect even on the great fan of a wind tunnel.
18495,Why isn’t the dust blown off by the air?
18496,"In spite of the fact that the fan blade is moving at high speed through the air, the speed of the air relative to the fan blade goes to zero right at the surface."
18497,"So the very smallest dust particles are not disturbed.1 We must modify the theory to agree with the experimental fact that in all ordinary fluids, the molecules next to a solid surface have zero velocity (relative to the surface).2"
18498,We originally characterized a liquid by the fact that if you put a shearing stress on it—no matter how small—it would give way.
18499,It flows.
18500,"In static situations, there are no shear stresses."
18501,But before equilibrium is reached—as long as you still push on it—there can be shear forces.
18502,Viscosity describes these shear forces which exist in a moving fluid.
18503,"To get a measure of the shear forces during the motion of a fluid, we consider the following kind of experiment."
18504,"Suppose that we have two solid plane surfaces with water between them, as in Fig."
18505,"If we have a more complicated situation, we can always consider a little, flat, rectangular cell in the water with its faces parallel to the flow, as in Fig."
18506,41–2.
18507,"As an example of the application of these ideas, we consider the motion of a fluid between two coaxial cylinders."
18508,See Fig.
18509,41–3.
18510,"We might ask, what is the velocity distribution between the cylinders?"
18511,The stress we have calculated is the tangential shear which is the same all around the cylinder.
18512,"If we want the torque, we can get it from Eqs."
18513,One standard apparatus for measuring the coefficients of viscosity is built this way.
18514,"One cylinder—say the outer one—is on pivots but is held stationary by a spring balance which measures the torque on it, while the inner one is rotated at a constant angular velocity."
18515,The coefficient of viscosity is then determined from Eq.
18516,(41.11).
18517,We now go to a general theory of viscous flow—at least in the most general form known to man.
18518,"However, in the general case of a compressible fluid there is another term in the stress which depends on other derivatives of the velocity."
18519,So it has to do with internal forces during compression.
18520,"So two constants are required to describe the liquid, just as we had two constants to describe a homogeneous elastic solid."
18521,(41.1) to get the equation of motion for a real fluid.
18522,The force on a small cubical volume element of a fluid is the resultant of the forces on all the six faces.
18523,"Taking them two at a time, we will get differences that depend on the derivatives of the stresses, and, therefore, on the second derivatives of the velocity."
18524,This is nice because it will get us back to a vector equation.
18525,"Then, the viscous force per unit volume contains only second derivatives of the velocity."
18526,"That is all that many people use; however, if you should want to calculate the absorption of sound in a fluid, you would need the second term."
18527,We can now complete our general equation of motion for a real fluid.
18528,Substituting Eq.
18529,(41.15) into Eq.
18530,But that’s the way nature is.
18531,"To see what the new term means, let’s look at the incompressible fluid case."
18532,"Then, if we take the curl of Eq."
18533,(40.9) except for the new term on the right-hand side.
18534,"When the right-hand side was zero, we had the Helmholtz theorem that the vorticity stays with the fluid."
18535,"Now, we have the rather complicated nonzero term on the right-hand side which, however, has straightforward physical consequences."
18536,"If there is a large gradient in the vorticity, it will spread out into the neighboring fluid."
18537,This is the term that causes the smoke ring to get thicker as it goes along.
18538,"Also, it shows up nicely if you send a “clean” vortex (a “smokeless” ring made by the apparatus described in the last chapter) through a cloud of smoke."
18539,"When it comes out of the cloud, it will have picked up some smoke, and you will see a hollow shell of a smoke ring."
18540,We will now describe the changes which are made in the character of fluid flow as a consequence of the new viscosity term.
18541,We will look at two problems in some detail.
18542,The first of these is the flow of a fluid past a cylinder—a flow which we tried to calculate in the previous chapter using the theory for nonviscous flow.
18543,It turns out that the viscous equations can be solved by man today only for a few special cases.
18544,So some of what we will tell you is based on experimental measurements—assuming that the experimental model satisfies Eq.
18545,(41.17).
18546,The flow should be given by Eq.
18547,"However, that is not the case."
18548,All the different possible solutions correspond to different values of one parameter.
18549,This is the most important general thing we can say about viscous flow.
18550,That reduces the number of independent parameters to three.
18551,"With our new variables, the derivatives in Eq."
18552,What this all means physically is very interesting.
18553,This is an important proposition because it means that we can determine what the behavior of the flow of air past an airplane wing will be without having to build an airplane and try it.
18554,"We can, instead, make a model and make measurements using a velocity that gives the same Reynolds number."
18555,"This is the principle which allows us to apply the results of “wind-tunnel” measurements on small-scale airplanes, or “model-basin” results on scale model boats, to the full-scale objects."
18556,"Remember, however, that we can only do this provided the compressibility of the fluid can be neglected."
18557,"Otherwise, a new quantity enters—the speed of sound."
18558,This latter ratio is called the Mach number.
18559,"So, for velocities near the speed of sound or above, the flows are the same in two situations if both the Mach number and the Reynolds number are the same for both situations."
18560,Let’s go back to the problem of low-speed (nearly incompressible) flow over the cylinder.
18561,We will give a qualitative description of the flow of a real fluid.
18562,"There are many things we might want to know about such a flow—for instance, what is the drag force on the cylinder?"
18563,The drag force on a cylinder is plotted in Fig.
18564,We will now describe the nature of flow for the different ranges of the Reynolds number.
18565,"First, when the Reynolds number is very small, the flow is quite steady; that is, the velocity is constant at any place, and the flow goes around the cylinder."
18566,"The actual distribution of the flow lines is, however, not like it is in potential flow."
18567,They are solutions of a somewhat different equation.
18568,He also solved the same problem for a sphere.
18569,"This is a very useful formula because it tells the speed at which tiny grains of dirt (or other particles which can be approximated as spheres) move through a fluid under a given force—as, for instance, in a centrifuge, or in sedimentation, or diffusion."
18570,41–5.
18571,"There is a circulation behind the sphere, as shown in Fig."
18572,41–6(b).
18573,It is still an open question as to whether there is always a circulation there even at the smallest Reynolds number or whether things suddenly change at a certain Reynolds number.
18574,It used to be thought that the circulation grew continuously.
18575,There is a pair of vortices behind the cylinder.
18576,There is suddenly a complete change in the character of the motion.
18577,What happens is that one of the vortices behind the cylinder gets so long that it breaks off and travels downstream with the fluid.
18578,Then the fluid curls around behind the cylinder and makes a new vortex.
18579,"The vortices peel off alternately on each side, so an instantaneous view of the flow looks roughly as sketched in Fig."
18580,41–6(c).
18581,We show a photograph of such a flow in Fig.
18582,41–7.
18583,The difference between the two flows in Fig.
18584,41–6(c) and 41–6(b) or 41–6(a) is almost a complete difference in regime.
18585,In Fig.
18586,"41–6(a) or (b), the velocity is constant, whereas in Fig."
18587,"41–6(c), the velocity at any point varies with time."
18588,41–4 by a dashed line.
18589,"For these higher Reynolds numbers, the flow varies with time but in a regular, cyclic fashion."
18590,We can get a physical idea of how these vortices are produced.
18591,We know that the fluid velocity must be zero at the surface of the cylinder and that it also increases rapidly away from that surface.
18592,Vorticity is created by this large local variation in fluid velocity.
18593,"Now when the main stream velocity is low enough, there is sufficient time for this vorticity to diffuse out of the thin region near the solid surface where it is produced and to grow into a large region of vorticity."
18594,"As the velocity gets higher and higher, there is less and less time for the vorticity to diffuse into a larger region of fluid."
18595,"By the time we reach a Reynolds number of several hundred, the vorticity begins to fill in a thin band, as shown in Fig."
18596,41–6(d).
18597,In this layer the flow is chaotic and irregular.
18598,"In the turbulent region, the velocities are very irregular and “noisy”; also the flow is no longer two-dimensional but twists and turns in all three dimensions."
18599,There is still a regular alternating motion superimposed on the turbulent one.
18600,The flow is as shown in Fig.
18601,"41–6(e), and we have what is called a “turbulent boundary layer.” Also, there is a drastic change in the drag force; it drops by a large factor, as shown in Fig."
18602,41–4.
18603,"In this speed region, the drag force actually decreases with increasing speed."
18604,There seems to be little evidence of periodicity.
18605,What happens for still larger Reynolds numbers?
18606,"As we increase the speed further, the wake increases in size again and the drag increases."
18607,"The details are as yet not entirely clear, and are still being studied experimentally."
18608,We would like to point out that none of the flows we have described are anything like the potential flow solution we found in the preceding chapter.
18609,"This is, at first sight, quite surprising."
18610,"(41.23), we get rid of the right-hand side and get just the equations of the last chapter."
18611,The answer is very interesting.
18612,Note that the right-hand term of Eq.
18613,It is a higher derivative than any other derivative in the equation.
18614,"You may be wondering, “What is the fine-grain turbulence and how does it maintain itself?"
18615,How can the vorticity which is made somewhere at the edge of the cylinder generate so much noise in the background?” The answer is again interesting.
18616,Vorticity has a tendency to amplify itself.
18617,This pulls the lines closer together and mixes them all up.
18618,Lines that were simple before will get knotted and pulled close together.
18619,They will be longer and tighter together.
18620,"The strength of the vorticity will increase and its irregularities—the pluses and minuses—will, in general, increase."
18621,So the magnitude of vorticity in three dimensions increases as we twist the fluid about.
18622,"You might well ask, “When is the potential flow a satisfactory theory at all?” In the first place, it is satisfactory outside the turbulent region where the vorticity has not entered appreciably by diffusion."
18623,"By making special streamlined bodies, we can keep the turbulent region as small as possible; the flow around airplane wings—which are carefully designed—is almost entirely true potential flow."
18624,It is possible to demonstrate that the complex and shifting character of the flow past a cylinder is not special but that the great variety of flow possibilities occurs generally.
18625,"We have worked out in Section 41–1 a solution for the viscous flow between two cylinders, and we can compare the results with what actually happens."
18626,"If we take two concentric cylinders with an oil in the space between them and put a fine aluminum powder as a suspension in the oil, the flow is easy to see."
18627,"Now if we turn the outer cylinder slowly, nothing unexpected happens; see Fig."
18628,41–8(a).
18629,"Alternatively, if we turn the inner cylinder slowly, nothing very striking occurs."
18630,"However, if we turn the inner cylinder at a higher rate, we get a surprise."
18631,"The fluid breaks into horizontal bands, as indicated in Fig."
18632,41–8(b).
18633,"When the outer cylinder rotates at a similar rate with the inner one at rest, no such effect occurs."
18634,How can it be that there is a difference between rotating the inner or the out cylinder?
18635,We can get the answer by looking at the cross sections shown in Fig.
18636,41–9.
18637,"When the inner layers of the fluid are moving more rapidly than the outer ones, they tend to move outward—the centrifugal force is larger than the pressure holding them in place."
18638,A whole layer cannot move out uniformly because the outer layers are in the way.
18639,"It must break into cells and circulate, as shown in Fig."
18640,41–9(b).
18641,It is like the convection currents in a room which has hot air at the bottom.
18642,"When the inner cylinder is at rest and the outer cylinder has a high velocity, the centrifugal forces build up a pressure gradient which keeps everything in equilibrium—see Fig."
18643,41–9(c) (as in a room with hot air at the top).
18644,Now let’s speed up the inner cylinder.
18645,"At first, the number of bands increases."
18646,"Then suddenly you see the bands become wavy, as in Fig."
18647,"41–8(c), and the waves travel around the cylinder."
18648,The speed of these waves is easily measured.
18649,And no one knows why!
18650,There’s a challenge.
18651,"In fact, the whole mechanism of the wave formation is not very well understood; yet it is steady laminar flow."
18652,If we now start rotating the outer cylinder also—but in the opposite direction—the flow pattern starts to break up.
18653,"We get wavy regions alternating with apparently quiet regions, as sketched in Fig."
18654,"41–8(d), making a spiral pattern."
18655,"In these “quiet” regions, however, we can see that the flow is really quite irregular; it is, in fact completely turbulent."
18656,The wavy regions also begin to show irregular turbulent flow.
18657,"If the cylinders are rotated still more rapidly, the whole flow becomes chaotically turbulent."
18658,"With our rotating cylinders, we can see many of the effects which occur in the flow past a cylinder: first, there is a steady flow; second, a flow sets in which varies in time but in a regular, smooth way; finally, the flow becomes completely irregular."
18659,You have all seen the same effects in the column of smoke rising from a cigarette in quiet air.
18660,"There is a smooth steady column followed by a series of twistings as the stream of smoke begins to break up, ending finally in an irregular churning cloud of smoke."
18661,The main lesson to be learned from all of this is that a tremendous variety of behavior is hidden in the simple set of equations in (41.23).
18662,We have no reason to think that there are any terms missing from these equations.
18663,"The only difficulty is that we do not have the mathematical power today to analyze them except for very small Reynolds numbers—that is, in the completely viscous case."
18664,That we have written an equation does not remove from the flow of fluids its charm or mystery or its surprise.
18665,"If such variety is possible in a simple equation with only one parameter, how much more is possible with more complex equations!"
18666,"Perhaps the fundamental equation that describes the swirling nebulae and the condensing, revolving, and exploding stars and galaxies is just a simple equation for the hydrodynamic behavior of nearly pure hydrogen gas."
18667,"Often, people in some unjustified fear of physics say you can’t write an equation for life."
18668,"Well, perhaps we can."
18669,"Unaware of the scope of simple equations, man has often concluded that nothing short of God, not mere equations, is required to explain the complexities of the world."
18670,We have written the equations of water flow.
18671,"From experiment, we find a set of concepts and approximations to use to discuss the solution—vortex streets, turbulent wakes, boundary layers."
18672,"When we have similar equations in a less familiar situation, and one for which we cannot yet experiment, we try to solve the equations in a primitive, halting, and confused way to try to determine what new qualitative features may come out, or what new qualitative forms are a consequence of the equations."
18673,"Our equations for the sun, for example, as a ball of hydrogen gas, describe a sun without sunspots, without the rice-grain structure of the surface, without prominences, without coronas."
18674,"Yet, all of these are really in the equations; we just haven’t found the way to get them out."
18675,There are those who are going to be disappointed when no life is found on other planets.
18676,"Not I—I want to be reminded and delighted and surprised once again, through interplanetary exploration, with the infinite variety and novelty of phenomena that can be generated from such simple principles."
18677,The test of science is its ability to predict.
18678,"Had you never visited the earth, could you predict the thunderstorms, the volcanos, the ocean waves, the auroras, and the colorful sunset?"
18679,"A salutary lesson it will be when we learn of all that goes on on each of those dead planets—those eight or ten balls, each agglomerated from the same dust cloud and each obeying exactly the same laws of physics."
18680,The next great era of awakening of human intellect may well produce a method of understanding the qualitative content of equations.
18681,Today we cannot.
18682,Today we cannot see that the water flow equations contain such things as the barber pole structure of turbulence that one sees between rotating cylinders.
18683,"Today we cannot see whether Schrödinger’s equation contains frogs, musical composers, or morality—or whether it does not."
18684,"We cannot say whether something beyond it like God is needed, or not."
18685,And so we can all hold strong opinions either way.
18686,"According to Newton everything attracts everything else with a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance from it, and objects respond to forces with accelerations proportional to the forces."
18687,They are Newton’s laws of universal gravitation and of motion.
18688,"As you know, they account for the motions of balls, planets, satellites, galaxies, and so forth."
18689,Einstein had a different interpretation of the law of gravitation.
18690,"According to him, space and time—which must be put together as space-time—are curved near heavy masses."
18691,And it is the attempt of things to go along “straight lines” in this curved space-time which makes them move the way they do.
18692,Now that is a complex idea—very complex.
18693,It is the idea we want to explain in this chapter.
18694,Our subject has three parts.
18695,One involves the effects of gravitation.
18696,Another involves the ideas of space-time which we already studied.
18697,The third involves the idea of curved space-time.
18698,We will simplify our subject in the beginning by not worrying about gravity and by leaving out the time—discussing just curved space.
18699,"We will talk later about the other parts, but we will concentrate now on the idea of curved space—what is meant by curved space, and, more specifically, what is meant by curved space in this application of Einstein."
18700,Now even that much turns out to be somewhat difficult in three dimensions.
18701,So we will first reduce the problem still further and talk about what is meant by the words “curved space” in two dimensions.
18702,In order to understand this idea of curved space in two dimensions you really have to appreciate the limited point of view of the character who lives in such a space.
18703,"Suppose we imagine a bug with no eyes who lives on a plane, as shown in Fig."
18704,42–1.
18705,"He can move only on the plane, and he has no way of knowing that there is anyway to discover any “outside world.” (He hasn’t got your imagination.)"
18706,"We are, of course, going to argue by analogy."
18707,"We live in a three-dimensional world, and we don’t have any imagination about going off our three-dimensional world in a new direction; so we have to think the thing out by analogy."
18708,"It is as though we were bugs living on a plane, and there was a space in another direction."
18709,"That’s why we will first work with the bug, remembering that he must live on his surface and can’t get out."
18710,"As another example of a bug living in two dimensions, let’s imagine one who lives on a sphere."
18711,"We imagine that he can walk around on the surface of the sphere, as in Fig."
18712,"42–2 but that he can’t look “up,” or “down,” or “out.”"
18713,Now we want to consider still a third kind of creature.
18714,"He is also a bug like the others, and also lives on a plane, as our first bug did, but this time the plane is peculiar."
18715,The temperature is different at different places.
18716,"Also, the bug and any rulers he uses are all made of the same material which expands when it is heated."
18717,Whenever he puts a ruler somewhere to measure something the ruler expands immediately to the proper length for the temperature at that place.
18718,"Wherever he puts any object—himself, a ruler, a triangle, or anything—the thing stretches itself because of the thermal expansion."
18719,"Everything is longer in the hot places than it is in the cold places, and everything has the same coefficient of expansion."
18720,"We will call the home of our third bug a “hot plate,” although we will particularly want to think of a special kind of hot plate that is cold in the center and gets hotter as we go out toward the edges (Fig."
18721,42–3).
18722,Now we are going to imagine that our bugs begin to study geometry.
18723,"Although we imagine that they are blind so that they can’t see any “outside” world, they can do a lot with their legs and feelers."
18724,"They can draw lines, and they can make rulers, and measure off lengths."
18725,"First, let’s suppose that they start with the simplest idea in geometry."
18726,They learn how to make a straight line—defined as the shortest line between two points.
18727,Our first bug—see Fig.
18728,42–4—learns to make very good lines.
18729,But what happens to the bug on the sphere?
18730,"He draws his straight line as the shortest distance—for him—between two points, as in Fig."
18731,42–5.
18732,"It may look like a curve to us, but he has no way of getting off the sphere and finding out that there is “really” a shorter line."
18733,He just knows that if he tries any other path in his world it is always longer than his straight line.
18734,So we will let him have his straight line as the shortest arc between two points.
18735,"(It is, of course an arc of a great circle.)"
18736,"Finally, our third bug—the one in Fig."
18737,42–3—will also draw “straight lines” that look like curves to us.
18738,42–6 would be on a curve like the one shown.
18739,Why?
18740,So for him the line is straight—he has no way of knowing that there could be someone out in a strange three-dimensional world who would call a different line “straight.”
18741,We think you get the idea now that all the rest of the analysis will always be from the point of view of the creatures on the particular surfaces and not from our point of view.
18742,With that in mind let’s see what the rest of their geometries looks like.
18743,Let’s assume that the bugs have all learned how to make two lines intersect at right angles.
18744,(You can figure out how they could do it.)
18745,Then our first bug (the one on the normal plane) finds an interesting fact.
18746,42–7(a).
18747,It is a property of his world—one of the facts of his “geometry.”
18748,Then he discovers another interesting thing.
18749,See Fig.
18750,42–7(b).
18751,Then he invents the circle.
18752,What’s a circle?
18753,"A circle is made this way: You rush off on straight lines in many many directions from a single point, and lay out a lot of dots that are all the same distance from that point."
18754,See Fig.
18755,42–7(c).
18756,(We have to be careful how we define these things because we’ve got to be able to make the analogs for the other fellows.)
18757,"Of course, its equivalent to the curve you can make by swinging a ruler around a point."
18758,"Anyway, our bug learns how to make circles."
18759,Then one day he thinks of measuring the distance around a circle.
18760,Now let’s see what our other bugs have been finding out about their geometries.
18761,"First, what happens to the bug on the sphere when he tries to make a “square”?"
18762,"If he follows the prescription we gave above, he would probably think that the result was hardly worth the trouble."
18763,He gets a figure like the one shown in Fig.
18764,42–8.
18765,It doesn’t work out to a closed figure at all.
18766,Get a sphere and try it.
18767,A similar thing would happen to our friend on the hot plate.
18768,If he lays out four straight lines of equal length—as measured with his expanding rulers—joined by right angles he gets a picture like the one in Fig.
18769,42–9.
18770,"Now suppose that our bugs had each had their own Euclid who had told them what geometry “should” be like, and that they had checked him out roughly by making crude measurements on a small scale."
18771,Then as they tried to make accurate squares on a larger scale they would discover that something was wrong.
18772,"The point is, that just by geometrical measurements they would discover that something was the matter with their space."
18773,We define a curved space to be a space in which the geometry is not what we expect for a plane.
18774,The geometry of the bugs on the sphere or on the hot plate is the geometry of a curved space.
18775,The rules of Euclidean geometry fail.
18776,And it isn’t necessary to be able to lift yourself out of the plane in order to find out that the world that you live in is curved.
18777,It isn’t necessary to circumnavigate the globe in order to find out that it is a ball.
18778,You can find out that you live on a ball by laying out a square.
18779,"If the square is very small you will need a lot of accuracy, but if the square is large the measurement can be done more crudely."
18780,Let’s take the case of a triangle on a plane.
18781,Our friend on the sphere can find triangles that are very peculiar.
18782,"He can, for example, find triangles which have three right angles."
18783,Yes indeed!
18784,One is shown in Fig.
18785,42–10.
18786,Suppose our bug starts at the north pole and makes a straight line all the way down to the equator.
18787,Then he makes a right angle and another perfect straight line the same length.
18788,Then he does it again.
18789,"For the very special length he has chosen he gets right back to his starting point, and also meets the first line with a right angle."
18790,As the triangle gets bigger the discrepancy goes up.
18791,The bugs on the hot plate would discover similar difficulties with their triangles.
18792,Let’s look next at what our other bugs find out about circles.
18793,They make circles and measure their circumferences.
18794,"For example, the bug on the sphere might make a circle like the one shown in Fig."
18795,42–11.
18796,(You can see that because from the wisdom of our three-dimensional view it is obvious that what he calls the “radius” is a curve which is longer than the true radius of the circle.)
18797,Our bug on the hot plate would discover a similar phenomenon.
18798,Suppose he was to draw a circle centered at the cold spot on the plate as in Fig.
18799,42–12.
18800,"If we were to watch him as he makes the circle we would notice that his rulers are short near the center and get longer as they are moved outward—although the bug doesn’t know it, of course."
18801,The hot-plate bug also finds an “excess radius effect.” And again the size of the effect depends on the radius of the circle.
18802,You can think of others.
18803,We have given two different examples of curved space: the sphere and the hot plate.
18804,"But it is interesting that if we choose the right temperature variation as a function of distance on the hot plate, the two geometries will be exactly the same."
18805,It is rather amusing.
18806,We can make the bug on the hot plate get exactly the same answers as the bug on the ball.
18807,For those who like geometry and geometrical problems we’ll tell you how it can be done.
18808,"If you assume that the length of the rulers (as determined by the temperature) goes in proportion to one plus some constant times the square of the distance away from the origin, then you will find that the geometry of that hot plate is exactly the same in all details1 as the geometry of the sphere."
18809,"There are, of course, other kinds of geometry."
18810,"We could ask about the geometry of a bug who lived on a pear, namely something which has a sharper curvature in one place and a weaker curvature in the other place, so that the excess in angles in triangles is more severe when he makes little triangles in one part of his world than when he makes them in another part."
18811,"In other words, the curvature of a space can vary from place to place."
18812,That’s just a generalization of the idea.
18813,It can also be imitated by a suitable distribution of temperature on a hot plate.
18814,We may also point out that the results could come out with the opposite kind of discrepancies.
18815,"That may sound impossible, but it isn’t at all."
18816,"First of all, we could have a hot plate with the temperature decreasing with the distance from the center."
18817,Then all the effects would be reversed.
18818,But we can also do it purely geometrically by looking at the two-dimensional geometry of the surface of a saddle.
18819,Imagine a saddle-shaped surface like the one sketched in Fig.
18820,42–13.
18821,"Now draw a “circle” on the surface, defined as the locus of all points the same distance from a center."
18822,This circle is a curve that oscillates up and down with a scallop effect.
18823,The “excess radius” would be negative.
18824,Spheres and pears and such are all surfaces of positive curvatures; and the others are called surfaces of negative curvature.
18825,"In general, a two-dimensional world will have a curvature which varies from place to place and may be positive in some places and negative in other places."
18826,"In general, we mean by a curved space simply one in which the rules of Euclidean geometry break down with one sign of discrepancy or the other."
18827,"The amount of curvature—defined, say, by the excess radius—may vary from place to place."
18828,"We might point out that, from our definition of curvature, a cylinder is, surprisingly enough, not curved."
18829,"If a bug lived on a cylinder, as shown in Fig."
18830,"42–14, he would find out that triangles, squares, and circles would all have the same behavior they have on a plane."
18831,"This is easy to see, by just thinking about how all the figures will look if the cylinder is unrolled onto a plane."
18832,Then all the geometrical figures can be made to correspond exactly to the way they are in a plane.
18833,"So there is no way for a bug living on a cylinder (assuming that he doesn’t go all the way around, but just makes local measurements) to discover that his space is curved."
18834,"In our technical sense, then, we consider that his space is not curved."
18835,"What we want to talk about is more precisely called intrinsic curvature; that is, a curvature which can be found by measurements only in a local region."
18836,(A cylinder has no intrinsic curvature.)
18837,This was the sense intended by Einstein when he said that our space is curved.
18838,But we as yet only have defined a curved space in two dimensions; we must go onward to see what the idea might mean in three dimensions.
18839,We live in three-dimensional space and we are going to consider the idea that three-dimensional space is curved.
18840,"You say, “But how can you imagine it being bent in any direction?” Well, we can’t imagine space being bent in any direction because our imagination isn’t good enough."
18841,"(Perhaps it’s just as well that we can’t imagine too much, so that we don’t get too free of the real world.)"
18842,But we can still define a curvature without getting out of our three-dimensional world.
18843,All we have been talking about in two dimensions was simply an exercise to show how we could get a definition of curvature which didn’t require that we be able to “look in” from the outside.
18844,We can determine whether our world is curved or not in a way quite analogous to the one used by the gentlemen who live on the sphere and on the hot plate.
18845,"We may not be able to distinguish between two such cases but we certainly can distinguish those cases from the flat space, the ordinary plane."
18846,How?
18847,Easy enough: We lay out a triangle and measure the angles.
18848,Or we make a great big circle and measure the circumference and the radius.
18849,"Or we try to lay out some accurate squares, or try to make a cube."
18850,In each case we test whether the laws of geometry work.
18851,"If they don’t work, we say that our space is curved."
18852,You will notice that in three dimensions the situation can be much more complicated than in two.
18853,At any one place in two dimensions there is a certain amount of curvature.
18854,But in three dimensions there can be several components to the curvature.
18855,"If we lay out a triangle in some plane, we may get a different answer than if we orient the plane of the triangle in a different way."
18856,Or take the example of a circle.
18857,Now we draw another circle at right angles—as in Fig.
18858,42–15.
18859,There’s no need for the excess to be exactly the same for both circles.
18860,"In fact, there might be a positive excess for a circle in one plane, and a defect (negative excess) for a circle in the other plane."
18861,Perhaps you are thinking of a better idea: Can’t we get around all of these components by using a sphere in three dimensions?
18862,We can specify a sphere by taking all the points that are the same distance from a given point in space.
18863,Then we can measure the surface area by laying out a fine scale rectangular grid on the surface of the sphere and adding up all the bits of area.
18864,But we can also measure the radius directly by digging a hole to the center and measuring the distance.
18865,It has the great advantage that it doesn’t depend upon how we orient a triangle or a circle.
18866,But the excess radius of a sphere also has a disadvantage; it doesn’t completely characterize the space.
18867,"It gives what is called the mean curvature of the three-dimensional world, since there is an averaging effect over the various curvatures."
18868,"Since it is an average, however, it does not solve completely the problem of defining the geometry."
18869,"If you know only this number you can’t predict all properties of the geometry of the space, because you can’t tell what would happen with circles of different orientation."
18870,The complete definition requires the specification of six “curvature numbers” at each point.
18871,Of course the mathematicians know how to write all those numbers.
18872,"You can read someday in a mathematics book how to write them all in a high-class and elegant form, but it is first a good idea to know in a rough way what it is that you are trying to write about."
18873,For most of our purposes the average curvature will be enough.2
18874,Now comes the main question.
18875,Is it true?
18876,"That is, is the actual physical three-dimensional space we live in curved?"
18877,"Once we have enough imagination to realize the possibility that space might be curved, the human mind naturally gets curious about whether the real world is curved or not."
18878,"People have made direct geometrical measurements to try to find out, and haven’t found any deviations."
18879,"On the other hand, by arguments about gravitation, Einstein discovered that space is curved, and we’d like to tell you what Einstein’s law is for the amount of curvature, and also tell you a little bit about how he found out about it."
18880,Einstein said that space is curved and that matter is the source of the curvature.
18881,"(Matter is also the source of gravitation, so gravity is related to the curvature—but that will come later in the chapter.)"
18882,This is Einstein’s law for the mean curvature of space.
18883,Suppose we take the earth as an example and forget that the density varies from point to point—so we won’t have to do any integrals.
18884,"Suppose we were to measure the surface of the earth very carefully, and then dig a hole to the center and measure the radius."
18885,"When we compared the predicted radius with the actual radius, we would find that the actual radius exceeded the predicted radius by the amount given in Eq."
18886,(42.3).
18887,You should note that the law says that the average curvature above the surface area of the earth is zero.
18888,But that does not mean that all the components of the curvature are zero.
18889,"There may still be—and, in fact, there is—some curvature above the earth."
18890,For a circle in a plane there will be an excess radius of one sign for some orientations and of the opposite sign for other orientations.
18891,It just turns out that the average over a sphere is zero when there is no mass inside it.
18892,"Incidentally, it turns out that there is a relation between the various components of the curvature and the variation of the average curvature from place to place."
18893,"So if you know the average curvature everywhere, you can figure out the details of the curvature components at each place."
18894,"The average curvature inside the earth varies with altitude, and this means that some curvature components are nonzero both inside the earth and outside."
18895,It is that curvature that we see as a gravitational force.
18896,"Suppose we have a bug on a plane, and suppose that the “plane” has little pimples in the surface."
18897,Wherever there is a pimple the bug would conclude that his space had little local regions of curvature.
18898,We have the same thing in three dimensions.
18899,"Wherever there is a lump of matter, our three-dimensional space has a local curvature—a kind of three-dimensional pimple."
18900,If we make a lot of bumps on a plane there might be an overall curvature besides all the pimples—the surface might become like a ball.
18901,It would be interesting to know whether our space has a net average curvature as well as the local pimples due to the lumps of matter like the earth and the sun.
18902,The astrophysicists have been trying to answer that question by making measurements of galaxies at very large distances.
18903,"For example, if the number of galaxies we see in a spherical shell at a large distance is different from what we would expect from our knowledge of the radius of the shell, we would have a measure of the excess radius of a tremendously large sphere."
18904,"From such measurements it is hoped to find out whether our whole universe is flat on the average, or round—whether it is “closed,” like a sphere, or “open” like a plane."
18905,You may have heard about the debates that are going on about this subject.
18906,There are debates because the astronomical measurements are still completely inconclusive; the experimental data are not precise enough to give a definite answer.
18907,"Unfortunately, we don’t have the slightest idea about the overall curvature of our universe on a large scale."
18908,Now we have to talk about time.
18909,"As you know from the special theory of relativity, measurements of space and measurements of time are interrelated."
18910,"And it would be kind of crazy to have something happening to the space, without the time being involved in the same thing."
18911,You will remember that the measurement of time depends on the speed at which you move.
18912,"For instance, if we watch a guy going by in a spaceship we see that things happen more slowly for him than for us."
18913,"In comparison with ours, his watch—and all other processes, like his heart beat—have been running slow."
18914,Now let’s consider an interesting problem.
18915,Suppose you are the one in the spaceship.
18916,And you are also asked to make the trip in such a way that your watch will show the longest possible elapsed time.
18917,How should you move?
18918,You should stand still.
18919,"Suppose, however, we change the problem a little."
18920,Again you are asked to make the trip in the way that lets you arrive with the latest possible reading on your watch.
18921,How would you do it?
18922,For which path and schedule will your watch show the greatest elapsed time when you arrive?
18923,The answer is that you will spend the longest time from your point of view if you make the trip by going at a uniform speed along a straight line.
18924,Reason: Any extra motions and any extra-high speeds will make your clock go slower.
18925,"(Since the time deviations depend on the square of the velocity, what you lose by going extra fast at one place you can never make up by going extra slowly in another place.)"
18926,The point of all this is that we can use the idea to define “a straight line” in space-time.
18927,The analog of a straight line in space is for space-time a motion at uniform velocity in a constant direction.
18928,“Straight-line” motion—the analog of “uniform velocity along a straight line”—is then that motion which takes a watch from one place at one time to another place at another time in the way that gives the longest time reading for the watch.
18929,This will be our definition for the analog of a straight line in space-time.
18930,Now we are ready to discuss the laws of gravitation.
18931,Einstein was trying to generate a theory of gravitation that would fit with the relativity theory that he had developed earlier.
18932,He was struggling along until he latched onto one important principle which guided him into getting the correct laws.
18933,That principle is based on the idea that when a thing is falling freely everything inside it seems weightless.
18934,"For example, a satellite in orbit is falling freely in the earth’s gravity, and an astronaut in it feels weightless."
18935,"This idea, when stated with greater precision, is called Einstein’s principle of equivalence."
18936,"It depends on the fact that all objects fall with exactly the same acceleration no matter what their mass, or what they are made of."
18937,"If we have a spaceship that is “coasting”—so it’s in a free fall—and there is a man inside, then the laws governing the fall of the man and the ship are the same."
18938,So if he puts himself in the middle of the ship he will stay there.
18939,He doesn’t fall with respect to the ship.
18940,That’s what we mean when we say he is “weightless.”
18941,Now suppose you are in a rocket ship which is accelerating.
18942,Accelerating with respect to what?
18943,Let’s just say that its engines are on and generating a thrust so that it is not coasting in a free fall.
18944,Also imagine that you are way out in empty space so that there are practically no gravitational forces on the ship.
18945,"Also if you let go of a ball, it will “fall” toward the floor."
18946,Why?
18947,"Because the ship is accelerating “upward,” but the ball has no forces on it, so it will not accelerate; it will get left behind."
18948,Now let’s compare that with the situation in a spaceship sitting at rest on the surface of the earth.
18949,Everything is the same!
18950,"In fact, how could you tell inside a space ship whether you are sitting on the earth or are accelerating in free space?"
18951,According to Einstein’s equivalence principle there is no way to tell if you only make measurements of what happens to things inside!
18952,"To be strictly correct, that is true only for one point inside the ship."
18953,"The gravitational field of the earth is not precisely uniform, so a freely falling ball has a slightly different acceleration at different places—the direction changes and the magnitude changes."
18954,"But if we imagine a strictly uniform gravitational field, it is completely imitated in every respect by a system with a constant acceleration."
18955,That is the basis of the principle of equivalence.
18956,Now we want to use the principle of equivalence for figuring out a strange thing that happens in a gravitational field.
18957,We’ll show you something that happens in a rocket ship which you probably wouldn’t have expected to happen in a gravitational field.
18958,"Suppose we put a clock at the “head” of the rocket ship—that is, at the “front” end—and we put another identical clock at the “tail,” as in Fig."
18959,42–16.
18960,"If we compare these two clocks when the ship is accelerating, the clock at the head seems to run fast relative to the one at the tail."
18961,It is a shorter distance because the ship is accelerating and has a higher speed at the time of the second flash.
18962,The same thing will also happen for all the later flashes.
18963,Everything fits together and there is nothing mysterious about it all.
18964,But now let’s think of the rocket ship at rest in the earth’s gravity.
18965,The same thing happens.
18966,"If you sit on the floor with one clock and watch another one which is sitting on a high shelf, it will appear to run faster than the one on the floor!"
18967,"You say, “But that is wrong."
18968,The times should be the same.
18969,With no acceleration there’s no reason for the clocks to appear to be out of step.” But they must if the principle of equivalence is right.
18970,"And Einstein insisted that the principle was right, and went courageously and correctly ahead."
18971,He proposed that clocks at different places in a gravitational field must appear to run at different speeds.
18972,"But if one always appears to be running at a different speed with respect to the other, then so far as the first is concerned the other is running at a different rate."
18973,"But now you see we have the analog for clocks of the hot ruler we were talking about earlier, when we had the bug on a hot plate."
18974,We imagined that rulers and bugs and everything changed lengths in the same way at various temperatures so they could never tell that their measuring sticks were changing as they moved around on the hot plate.
18975,It’s the same with clocks in a gravitational field.
18976,Every clock we put at a higher level is seen to go faster.
18977,"Heartbeats go faster, all processes run faster."
18978,If they didn’t you would be able to tell the difference between a gravitational field and an accelerating reference system.
18979,"The idea that time can vary from place to place is a difficult one, but it is the idea Einstein used, and it is correct—believe it or not."
18980,Using the principle of equivalence we can figure out how much the speed of a clock changes with height in a gravitational field.
18981,We just work out the apparent discrepancy between the two clocks in the accelerating rocket ship.
18982,The easiest way to do this is to use the result we found in Chapter 34 of Vol.
18983,I for the Doppler effect.
18984,"There, we found—see Eq."
18985,42–17 the emitter and receiver are moving with equal velocities at any one instant.
18986,The receiver always has this velocity with respect to the emitter at the instant the signal left it.
18987,"So this is the velocity we should use in the Doppler shift formula, Eq."
18988,(42.4).
18989,This is such an important idea we would like to demonstrate that it also follows from another law of physics—from the conservation of energy.
18990,"For instance, the masses of nuclei determined from the energies of nuclear reactions which transmute one nucleus into another agree with the masses obtained from atomic weights."
18991,Afterward we carry the atom back to the floor.
18992,Now suppose that the photon happened to go down to the floor and be absorbed.
18993,How much energy would it deliver there?
18994,"But that can’t be right if energy is conserved, as you can see from the following argument."
18995,(42.10).
18996,"If energy is conserved, the energy we end up with at the floor must be greater than we started with by just the work we have done."
18997,Otherwise some energy would have been lost.
18998,If we substitute in Eq.
18999,(42.12) gives again the relation of (42.5) between the frequency of the photon when it is absorbed on the floor and the frequency with which it was emitted.
19000,The same result can be obtained in still another way.
19001,(42.5).
19002,"Our ideas about relativity, quantum physics, and energy conservation all fit together only if Einstein’s predictions about clocks in a gravitational field are right."
19003,The frequency changes we are talking about are normally very small.
19004,"However, just such a change has recently been found experimentally using the Mössbauer effect.5 Einstein was perfectly correct."
19005,Now we want to relate what we have just been talking about to the idea of curved space-time.
19006,"We have already pointed out that if the time goes at different rates in different places, it is analogous to the curved space of the hot plate."
19007,But it is more than an analogy; it means that space-time is curved.
19008,Let’s try to do some geometry in space-time.
19009,"That may at first sound peculiar, but we have often made diagrams of space-time with distance plotted along one axis and time along the other."
19010,Suppose we try to make a rectangle in space-time.
19011,42–18(a).
19012,42–18(c).
19013,"42–18(e), the pieces don’t fit."
19014,And that’s what we mean when we say that space-time is curved.
19015,Let’s consider an interesting little puzzle.
19016,42–19.
19017,Now here is the puzzle.
19018,"You say, “That’s easy."
19019,"Then it will run as fast as possible, and be the latest when you return.” Wrong."
19020,You see that we have a kind of game.
19021,"If we go a little higher, maybe we can gain a little more."
19022,"The ball’s motion—rising fast, slowing down, stopping, and coming back down—is exactly the right motion to make the time the maximum on a wrist watch strapped to the ball."
19023,Now consider a slightly different game.
19024,We play the same game that we did earlier to find what we call the straight line.
19025,"If we don’t go along a straight line it takes more speed, and our watch is slowed down.” But wait!"
19026,That was before we took gravity into account.
19027,Isn’t it better to curve upward a little bit and then come down?
19028,Then during part of the time we are higher up and our watch will run a little faster?
19029,"It is, indeed."
19030,"If you solve the mathematical problem of adjusting the curve of the motion so that the elapsed time of the moving watch is the most it can possibly be, you will find that the motion is a parabola—the same curve followed by something that moves on a free ballistic path in the gravitational field, as in Fig."
19031,42–19.
19032,"Therefore the law of motion in a gravitational field can also be stated: An object always moves from one place to another so that a clock carried on it gives a longer time than it would on any other possible trajectory—with, of course, the same starting and finishing conditions."
19033,"The time measured by a moving clock is often called its “proper time.” In free fall, the trajectory makes the proper time of an object a maximum."
19034,Let’s see how this all works out.
19035,We begin with Eq.
19036,"The constant won’t change the condition for the maximum, but the minus sign will just change the maximum to a minimum."
19037,And if you look in Chapter 19 of Volume II you will see that when we discussed the principle of least action we showed that Newton’s laws for an object in any potential could be written exactly in the form of Eq.
19038,(42.18).
19039,Einstein’s form of the equations of motion—that the proper time should be a maximum in curved space-time—gives the same results as Newton’s laws for low velocities.
19040,"As he was circling around the earth, Gordon Cooper’s watch was reading later than it would have in any other path you could have imagined for his satellite.6"
19041,So the law of gravitation can be stated in terms of the ideas of the geometry of space-time in this remarkable way.
19042,The particles always take the longest proper time—in space-time a quantity analogous to the “shortest distance.” That’s the law of motion in a gravitational field.
19043,"The great advantage of putting it this way is that the law doesn’t depend on any coordinates, or any other way of defining the situation."
19044,Now let’s summarize what we have done.
19045,We have given you two laws for gravity:
19046,Those two laws correspond to similar pairs of laws we have seen earlier.
19047,We originally described motion in a gravitational field in terms of Newton’s inverse square law of gravitation and his laws of motion.
19048,Now laws (1) and (2) take their places.
19049,Our new pair of laws also correspond to what we have seen in electrodynamics.
19050,There we had our law—the set of Maxwell’s equations—which determines the fields produced by charges.
19051,"It tells how the character of “space” is changed by the presence of charged matter, which is what law (1) does for gravity."
19052,"This, for gravity, is done by law (2)."
19053,In the laws (1) and (2) you have a precise statement of Einstein’s theory of gravitation—although you will usually find it stated in a more complicated mathematical form.
19054,"We should, however, make one further addition."
19055,"Just as time scales change from place to place in a gravitational field, so do also the length scales."
19056,Rulers change lengths as you move around.
19057,It is impossible with space and time so intimately mixed to have something happen with time that isn’t in some way reflected in space.
19058,Take even the simplest example: You are riding past the earth.
19059,What is “time” from your point of view is partly space from our point of view.
19060,So there must also be changes in space.
19061,"It is the entire space-time which is distorted by the presence of matter, and this is more complicated than a change only in time scale."
19062,"However, the rule that we gave in Eq."
19063,"(42.3) is enough to determine completely all the laws of gravitation, provided that it is understood that this rule about the curvature of space applies not only from one man’s point of view but is true for everybody."
19064,"Somebody riding by a mass of material sees a different mass content because of the kinetic energy he calculates for its motion past him, and he must include the mass corresponding to that energy."
19065,"That this law—law (1)—should be true in any moving system is one of the great laws of gravitation, called Einstein’s field equation."
19066,The other great law is (2)—that things must move so that the proper time is a maximum—and is called Einstein’s equation of motion.
19067,"To write these laws in a complete algebraic form, to compare them with Newton’s laws, or to relate them to electrodynamics is difficult mathematically."
19068,But it is the way our most complete laws of the physics of gravity look today.
19069,"Although they gave a result in agreement with Newton’s mechanics for the simple example we considered, they do not always do so."
19070,The three discrepancies first derived by Einstein have been experimentally confirmed: The orbit of Mercury is not a fixed ellipse; starlight passing near the sun is deflected twice as much as you would think; and the rates of clocks depend on their location in a gravitational field.
19071,Whenever the predictions of Einstein have been found to differ from the ideas of Newtonian mechanics Nature has chosen Einstein’s.
19072,Let’s summarize everything that we have said in the following way.
19073,"First, time and distance rates depend on the place in space you measure them and on the time."
19074,This is equivalent to the statement that space-time is curved.
19075,This fixes the exact degree of the curvature of space-time.
19076,And the curvature must be the same no matter who is looking at the matter or how it is moving.
19077,"Second, particles move on “straight lines” (trajectories of maximum proper time) in this curved space-time."
19078,This is the content of Einstein’s formulation of the laws of gravitation.
19079,"“Quantum mechanics” is the description of the behavior of matter and light in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale."
19080,Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about.
19081,"They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen."
19082,"Newton thought that light was made up of particles, but then it was discovered that it behaves like a wave."
19083,"Later, however (in the beginning of the twentieth century), it was found that light did indeed sometimes behave like a particle."
19084,"Historically, the electron, for example, was thought to behave like a particle, and then it was found that in many respects it behaved like a wave."
19085,So it really behaves like neither.
19086,Now we have given up.
19087,We say: “It is like neither.”
19088,"There is one lucky break, however—electrons behave just like light."
19089,"The quantum behavior of atomic objects (electrons, protons, neutrons, photons, and so on) is the same for all, they are all “particle waves,” or whatever you want to call them."
19090,"So what we learn about the properties of electrons (which we shall use for our examples) will apply also to all “particles,” including photons of light."
19091,"The gradual accumulation of information about atomic and small-scale behavior during the first quarter of the 20th century, which gave some indications about how small things do behave, produced an increasing confusion which was finally resolved in 1926 and 1927 by Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and Born."
19092,They finally obtained a consistent description of the behavior of matter on a small scale.
19093,We take up the main features of that description in this chapter.
19094,"Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to, and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone—both to the novice and to the experienced physicist."
19095,"Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because all of direct, human experience and of human intuition applies to large objects."
19096,"We know how large objects will act, but things on a small scale just do not act that way."
19097,So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience.
19098,In this chapter we shall tackle immediately the basic element of the mysterious behavior in its most strange form.
19099,"We choose to examine a phenomenon which is impossible, absolutely impossible, to explain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics."
19100,"In reality, it contains the only mystery."
19101,We cannot make the mystery go away by “explaining” how it works.
19102,We will just tell you how it works.
19103,In telling you how it works we will have told you about the basic peculiarities of all quantum mechanics.
19104,"To try to understand the quantum behavior of electrons, we shall compare and contrast their behavior, in a particular experimental setup, with the more familiar behavior of particles like bullets, and with the behavior of waves like water waves."
19105,We consider first the behavior of bullets in the experimental setup shown diagrammatically in Fig.
19106,1–1.
19107,We have a machine gun that shoots a stream of bullets.
19108,"It is not a very good gun, in that it sprays the bullets (randomly) over a fairly large angular spread, as indicated in the figure."
19109,In front of the gun we have a wall (made of armor plate) that has in it two holes just about big enough to let a bullet through.
19110,Beyond the wall is a backstop (say a thick wall of wood) which will “absorb” the bullets when they hit it.
19111,In front of the backstop we have an object which we shall call a “detector” of bullets.
19112,It might be a box containing sand.
19113,Any bullet that enters the detector will be stopped and accumulated.
19114,"When we wish, we can empty the box and count the number of bullets that have been caught."
19115,"A bullet which happens to hit one of the holes may bounce off the edges of the hole, and may end up anywhere at all."
19116,"By “probability” we mean the chance that the bullet will arrive at the detector, which we can measure by counting the number which arrive at the detector in a certain time and then taking the ratio of this number to the total number that hit the backstop during that time."
19117,"Or, if we assume that the gun always shoots at the same rate during the measurements, the probability we want is just proportional to the number that reach the detector in some standard time interval."
19118,"For our present purposes we would like to imagine a somewhat idealized experiment in which the bullets are not real bullets, but are indestructible bullets—they cannot break in half."
19119,"In our experiment we find that bullets always arrive in lumps, and when we find something in the detector, it is always one whole bullet."
19120,"If the rate at which the machine gun fires is made very low, we find that at any given moment either nothing arrives, or one and only one—exactly one—bullet arrives at the backstop."
19121,"Also, the size of the lump certainly does not depend on the rate of firing of the gun."
19122,We shall say: “Bullets always arrive in identical lumps.” What we measure with our detector is the probability of arrival of a lump.
19123,"The result of such measurements with this apparatus (we have not yet done the experiment, so we are really imagining the result) are plotted in the graph drawn in part (c) of Fig."
19124,1–1.
19125,Comparing parts (b) and (c) of Fig.
19126,The effect with both holes open is the sum of the effects with each hole open alone.
19127,"We shall call this result an observation of “no interference,” for a reason that you will see later."
19128,So much for bullets.
19129,"They come in lumps, and their probability of arrival shows no interference."
19130,Now we wish to consider an experiment with water waves.
19131,The apparatus is shown diagrammatically in Fig.
19132,1–2.
19133,We have a shallow trough of water.
19134,A small object labeled the “wave source” is jiggled up and down by a motor and makes circular waves.
19135,"To the right of the source we have again a wall with two holes, and beyond that is a second wall, which, to keep things simple, is an “absorber,” so that there is no reflection of the waves that arrive there."
19136,The detector is now a device which measures the “intensity” of the wave motion.
19137,"You can imagine a gadget which measures the height of the wave motion, but whose scale is calibrated in proportion to the square of the actual height, so that the reading is proportional to the intensity of the wave."
19138,"Our detector reads, then, in proportion to the energy being carried by the wave—or rather, the rate at which energy is carried to the detector."
19139,"With our wave apparatus, the first thing to notice is that the intensity can have any size."
19140,"If the source just moves a very small amount, then there is just a little bit of wave motion at the detector."
19141,"When there is more motion at the source, there is more intensity at the detector."
19142,The intensity of the wave can have any value at all.
19143,We would not say that there was any “lumpiness” in the wave intensity.
19144,We have already worked out how such patterns can come about when we studied the interference of electric waves in Volume I.
19145,"In this case we would observe that the original wave is diffracted at the holes, and new circular waves spread out from each hole."
19146,If we cover one hole at a time and measure the intensity distribution at the absorber we find the rather simple intensity curves shown in part (b) of the figure.
19147,We say that there is “interference” of the two waves.
19148,We say that the two waves are “interfering constructively” at such places.
19149,There will be such constructive interference wherever the distance from the detector to one hole is a whole number of wavelengths larger (or shorter) than the distance from the detector to the other hole.
19150,"The waves “interfere destructively,” and we get a low value for the wave intensity."
19151,1–2 correspond to the places where the two waves interfere destructively.
19152,You will notice that the result is quite different from that obtained with bullets (Eq.
19153,1.1).
19154,"The intensity can have any value, and it shows interference."
19155,Now we imagine a similar experiment with electrons.
19156,It is shown diagrammatically in Fig.
19157,1–3.
19158,We make an electron gun which consists of a tungsten wire heated by an electric current and surrounded by a metal box with a hole in it.
19159,"If the wire is at a negative voltage with respect to the box, electrons emitted by the wire will be accelerated toward the walls and some will pass through the hole."
19160,All the electrons which come out of the gun will have (nearly) the same energy.
19161,In front of the gun is again a wall (just a thin metal plate) with two holes in it.
19162,Beyond the wall is another plate which will serve as a “backstop.” In front of the backstop we place a movable detector.
19163,"The detector might be a geiger counter or, perhaps better, an electron multiplier, which is connected to a loudspeaker."
19164,We should say right away that you should not try to set up this experiment (as you could have done with the two we have already described).
19165,This experiment has never been done in just this way.
19166,The trouble is that the apparatus would have to be made on an impossibly small scale to show the effects we are interested in.
19167,"We are doing a “thought experiment,” which we have chosen because it is easy to think about."
19168,"We know the results that would be obtained because there are many experiments that have been done, in which the scale and the proportions have been chosen to show the effects we shall describe."
19169,"The first thing we notice with our electron experiment is that we hear sharp “clicks” from the detector (that is, from the loudspeaker)."
19170,And all “clicks” are the same.
19171,There are no “half-clicks.”
19172,We would also notice that the “clicks” come very erratically.
19173,Something like: click ….. click-click … click …….. click ….
19174,"click-click …… click …, etc., just as you have, no doubt, heard a geiger counter operating."
19175,"If we count the clicks which arrive in a sufficiently long time—say for many minutes—and then count again for another equal period, we find that the two numbers are very nearly the same."
19176,So we can speak of the average rate at which the clicks are heard (so-and-so-many clicks per minute on the average).
19177,"As we move the detector around, the rate at which the clicks appear is faster or slower, but the size (loudness) of each click is always the same."
19178,"If we lower the temperature of the wire in the gun, the rate of clicking slows down, but still each click sounds the same."
19179,"We would notice also that if we put two separate detectors at the backstop, one or the other would click, but never both at once."
19180,"(Except that once in a while, if there were two clicks very close together in time, our ear might not sense the separation.)"
19181,"We conclude, therefore, that whatever arrives at the backstop arrives in “lumps.” All the “lumps” are the same size: only whole “lumps” arrive, and they arrive one at a time at the backstop."
19182,We shall say: “Electrons always arrive in identical lumps.”
19183,1–3.
19184,Yes!
19185,That is the way electrons go.
19186,Now let us try to analyze the curve of Fig.
19187,1–3 to see whether we can understand the behavior of the electrons.
19188,Let us write this in the form of a “Proposition”:
19189,Let us check this idea by experiment.
19190,1–3.
19191,The result seems quite reasonable.
19192,The result of this measurement is also drawn in the figure.
19193,How can such an interference come about?
19194,Perhaps they go in a more complicated way.
19195,They split in half and …” But no!
19196,"There are some points at which very few electrons arrive when both holes are open, but which receive many electrons if we close one hole, so closing one hole increased the number from the other."
19197,It is as though closing one hole decreased the number of electrons which come through the other hole.
19198,It seems hard to explain both effects by proposing that the electrons travel in complicated paths.
19199,It is all quite mysterious.
19200,And the more you look at it the more mysterious it seems.
19201,None of them has succeeded.
19202,"1–2, and that was simple."
19203,The mathematics is the same as that we had for the water waves!
19204,(It is hard to see how one could get such a simple result from a complicated game of electrons going back and forth through the plate on some strange trajectory.)
19205,"We conclude the following: The electrons arrive in lumps, like particles, and the probability of arrival of these lumps is distributed like the distribution of intensity of a wave."
19206,It is in this sense that an electron behaves “sometimes like a particle and sometimes like a wave.”
19207,"Incidentally, when we were dealing with classical waves we defined the intensity as the mean over time of the square of the wave amplitude, and we used complex numbers as a mathematical trick to simplify the analysis."
19208,But in quantum mechanics it turns out that the amplitudes must be represented by complex numbers.
19209,The real parts alone will not do.
19210,"That is a technical point, for the moment, because the formulas look just the same."
19211,But there are a large number of subtleties involved in the fact that nature does work this way.
19212,We would like to illustrate some of these subtleties for you now.
19213,But that conclusion can be tested by another experiment.
19214,We shall now try the following experiment.
19215,"To our electron apparatus we add a very strong light source, placed behind the wall and between the two holes, as shown in Fig."
19216,1–4.
19217,We know that electric charges scatter light.
19218,"So when an electron passes, however it does pass, on its way to the detector, it will scatter some light to our eye, and we can see where the electron goes."
19219,"If it should happen that we get light from both places at the same time, because the electron divides in half … Let us just do the experiment!"
19220,And we observe the same result no matter where we put the detector.
19221,From this observation we conclude that when we look at the electrons we find that the electrons go either through one hole or the other.
19222,"Experimentally, Proposition A is necessarily true."
19223,"What, then, is wrong with our argument against Proposition A?"
19224,Back to experiment!
19225,Let us keep track of the electrons and find out what they are doing.
19226,1–4.
19227,"Well, that is not too surprising!"
19228,So there is not any complicated business like going through both holes.
19229,"When we watch them, the electrons come through just as we would expect them to come through."
19230,But wait!
19231,"What do we have now for the total probability, the probability that an electron will arrive at the detector by any route?"
19232,We already have that information.
19233,"We just pretend that we never looked at the light flashes, and we lump together the detector clicks which we have separated into the two columns."
19234,We must just add the numbers.
19235,We must conclude that when we look at the electrons the distribution of them on the screen is different than when we do not look.
19236,Perhaps it is turning on our light source that disturbs things?
19237,"It must be that the electrons are very delicate, and the light, when it scatters off the electrons, gives them a jolt that changes their motion."
19238,We know that the electric field of the light acting on a charge will exert a force on it.
19239,So perhaps we should expect the motion to be changed.
19240,"Anyway, the light exerts a big influence on the electrons."
19241,By trying to “watch” the electrons we have changed their motions.
19242,You may be thinking: “Don’t use such a bright source!
19243,Turn the brightness down!
19244,The light waves will then be weaker and will not disturb the electrons so much.
19245,"Surely, by making the light dimmer and dimmer, eventually the wave will be weak enough that it will have a negligible effect.” O.K."
19246,Let’s try it.
19247,The first thing we observe is that the flashes of light scattered from the electrons as they pass by does not get weaker.
19248,It is always the same-sized flash.
19249,The only thing that happens as the light is made dimmer is that sometimes we hear a “click” from the detector but see no flash at all.
19250,"The electron has gone by without being “seen.” What we are observing is that light also acts like electrons, we knew that it was “wavy,” but now we find that it is also “lumpy.” It always arrives—or is scattered—in lumps that we call “photons.” As we turn down the intensity of the light source we do not change the size of the photons, only the rate at which they are emitted."
19251,"That explains why, when our source is dim, some electrons get by without being seen."
19252,There did not happen to be a photon around at the time the electron went through.
19253,This is all a little discouraging.
19254,"If it is true that whenever we “see” the electron we see the same-sized flash, then those electrons we see are always the disturbed ones."
19255,Let us try the experiment with a dim light anyway.
19256,1–3!
19257,"If the electrons are not seen, we have interference!"
19258,That is understandable.
19259,"When we do not see the electron, no photon disturbs it, and when we do see it, a photon has disturbed it."
19260,There is always the same amount of disturbance because the light photons all produce the same-sized effects and the effect of the photons being scattered is enough to smear out any interference effect.
19261,Is there not some way we can see the electrons without disturbing them?
19262,Certainly the jolt given to the electron when the photon is scattered toward our eye depends on the momentum that photon carries.
19263,Aha!
19264,"If we want to disturb the electrons only slightly we should not have lowered the intensity of the light, we should have lowered its frequency (the same as increasing its wavelength)."
19265,Let us use light of a redder color.
19266,"We could even use infrared light, or radiowaves (like radar), and “see” where the electron went with the help of some equipment that can “see” light of these longer wavelengths."
19267,If we use “gentler” light perhaps we can avoid disturbing the electrons so much.
19268,Let us try the experiment with longer waves.
19269,"We shall keep repeating our experiment, each time with light of a longer wavelength."
19270,"At first, nothing seems to change."
19271,The results are the same.
19272,Then a terrible thing happens.
19273,"You remember that when we discussed the microscope we pointed out that, due to the wave nature of the light, there is a limitation on how close two spots can be and still be seen as two separate spots."
19274,This distance is of the order of the wavelength of light.
19275,"So now, when we make the wavelength longer than the distance between our holes, we see a big fuzzy flash when the light is scattered by the electrons."
19276,We can no longer tell which hole the electron went through!
19277,We just know it went somewhere!
19278,1–3.
19279,"In our experiment we find that it is impossible to arrange the light in such a way that one can tell which hole the electron went through, and at the same time not disturb the pattern."
19280,It was suggested by Heisenberg that the then new laws of nature could only be consistent if there were some basic limitation on our experimental capabilities not previously recognized.
19281,"He proposed, as a general principle, his uncertainty principle, which we can state in terms of our experiment as follows: “It is impossible to design an apparatus to determine which hole the electron passes through, that will not at the same time disturb the electrons enough to destroy the interference pattern.” If an apparatus is capable of determining which hole the electron goes through, it cannot be so delicate that it does not disturb the pattern in an essential way."
19282,No one has ever found (or even thought of) a way around the uncertainty principle.
19283,So we must assume that it describes a basic characteristic of nature.
19284,"The complete theory of quantum mechanics which we now use to describe atoms and, in fact, all matter, depends on the correctness of the uncertainty principle."
19285,"Since quantum mechanics is such a successful theory, our belief in the uncertainty principle is reinforced."
19286,"But if a way to “beat” the uncertainty principle were ever discovered, quantum mechanics would give inconsistent results and would have to be discarded as a valid theory of nature."
19287,"“Well,” you say, “what about Proposition A?"
19288,What we must say (to avoid making wrong predictions) is the following.
19289,"If one does say that, and starts to make any deductions from the statement, he will make errors in the analysis."
19290,This is the logical tightrope on which we must walk if we wish to describe nature successfully.
19291,"If the motion of all matter—as well as electrons—must be described in terms of waves, what about the bullets in our first experiment?"
19292,Why didn’t we see an interference pattern there?
19293,It turns out that for the bullets the wavelengths were so tiny that the interference patterns became very fine.
19294,"So fine, in fact, that with any detector of finite size one could not distinguish the separate maxima and minima."
19295,"What we saw was only a kind of average, which is the classical curve."
19296,In Fig.
19297,1–5 we have tried to indicate schematically what happens with large-scale objects.
19298,"Part (a) of the figure shows the probability distribution one might predict for bullets, using quantum mechanics."
19299,The rapid wiggles are supposed to represent the interference pattern one gets for waves of very short wavelength.
19300,"Any physical detector, however, straddles several wiggles of the probability curve, so that the measurements show the smooth curve drawn in part (b) of the figure."
19301,We will now write a summary of the main conclusions of our experiments.
19302,"We will, however, put the results in a form which makes them true for a general class of such experiments."
19303,"We can write our summary more simply if we first define an “ideal experiment” as one in which there are no uncertain external influences, i.e., no jiggling or other things going on that we cannot take into account."
19304,"We would be quite precise if we said: “An ideal experiment is one in which all of the initial and final conditions of the experiment are completely specified.” What we will call “an event” is, in general, just a specific set of initial and final conditions."
19305,"(For example: “an electron leaves the gun, arrives at the detector, and nothing else happens.”) Now for our summary."
19306,Summary
19307,One might still like to ask: “How does it work?
19308,What is the machinery behind the law?” No one has found any machinery behind the law.
19309,No one can “explain” any more than we have just “explained.” No one will give you any deeper representation of the situation.
19310,We have no ideas about a more basic mechanism from which these results can be deduced.
19311,We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics.
19312,We have been talking about the probability that an electron will arrive in a given circumstance.
19313,We have implied that in our experimental arrangement (or even in the best possible one) it would be impossible to predict exactly what would happen.
19314,We can only predict the odds!
19315,"This would mean, if it were true, that physics has given up on the problem of trying to predict exactly what will happen in a definite circumstance."
19316,Yes!
19317,physics has given up.
19318,"We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance, and we believe now that it is impossible—that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events."
19319,It must be recognized that this is a retrenchment in our earlier ideal of understanding nature.
19320,"It may be a backward step, but no one has seen a way to avoid it."
19321,We make now a few remarks on a suggestion that has sometimes been made to try to avoid the description we have given: “Perhaps the electron has some kind of internal works—some inner variables—that we do not yet know about.
19322,Perhaps that is why we cannot predict what will happen.
19323,"If we could look more closely at the electron, we could be able to tell where it would end up.” So far as we know, that is impossible."
19324,We would still be in difficulty.
19325,Suppose we were to assume that inside the electron there is some kind of machinery that determines where it is going to end up.
19326,That machine must also determine which hole it is going to go through on its way.
19327,"But we must not forget that what is inside the electron should not be dependent on what we do, and in particular upon whether we open or close one of the holes."
19328,There seems to be no way around this.
19329,But we have verified experimentally that that is not the case.
19330,And no one has figured a way out of this puzzle.
19331,So at the present time we must limit ourselves to computing probabilities.
19332,"We say “at the present time,” but we suspect very strongly that it is something that will be with us forever—that it is impossible to beat that puzzle—that this is the way nature really is."
19333,The uncertainties in the position and momentum of a particle at any instant must have their product greater than or equal to half the reduced Planck constant.
19334,This is a special case of the uncertainty principle that was stated above more generally.
19335,"The more general statement was that one cannot design equipment in any way to determine which of two alternatives is taken, without, at the same time, destroying the pattern of interference."
19336,Let us show for one particular case that the kind of relation given by Heisenberg must be true in order to keep from getting into trouble.
19337,We imagine a modification of the experiment of Fig.
19338,1–6.
19339,By watching the motion of the plate carefully we can try to tell which hole an electron goes through.
19340,"Since the vertical component of the electron momentum is changed, the plate must recoil with an equal momentum in the opposite direction."
19341,The plate will get an upward kick.
19342,"If the electron goes through the lower hole, the plate should feel a downward kick."
19343,So!
19344,"Without disturbing the electrons at all, but just by watching the plate, we can tell which path the electron used."
19345,"Now in order to do this it is necessary to know what the momentum of the screen is, before the electron goes through."
19346,"So when we measure the momentum after the electron goes by, we can figure out how much the plate’s momentum has changed."
19347,"But remember, according to the uncertainty principle we cannot at the same time know the position of the plate with an arbitrary accuracy."
19348,"But if we do not know exactly where the plate is, we cannot say precisely where the two holes are."
19349,They will be in a different place for every electron that goes through.
19350,This means that the center of our interference pattern will have a different location for each electron.
19351,The wiggles of the interference pattern will be smeared out.
19352,Such a random shift is just enough to smear out the pattern so that no interference is observed.
19353,The uncertainty principle “protects” quantum mechanics.
19354,"Heisenberg recognized that if it were possible to measure the momentum and the position simultaneously with a greater accuracy, the quantum mechanics would collapse."
19355,So he proposed that it must be impossible.
19356,"Then people sat down and tried to figure out ways of doing it, and nobody could figure out a way to measure the position and the momentum of anything—a screen, an electron, a billiard ball, anything—with any greater accuracy."
19357,Quantum mechanics maintains its perilous but still correct existence.
19358,In this chapter we shall discuss the relationship of the wave and particle viewpoints.
19359,"We already know, from the last chapter, that neither the wave viewpoint nor the particle viewpoint is correct."
19360,"We would always like to present things accurately, or at least precisely enough that they will not have to be changed when we learn more—it may be extended, but it will not be changed!"
19361,"But when we try to talk about the wave picture or the particle picture, both are approximate, and both will change."
19362,Therefore what we learn in this chapter will not be accurate in a certain sense; we will deal with some half-intuitive arguments which will be made more precise later.
19363,But certain things will be changed a little bit when we interpret them correctly in quantum mechanics.
19364,We are doing this so that you can have some qualitative feeling for some quantum phenomena before we get into the mathematical details of quantum mechanics.
19365,"Furthermore, all our experiences are with waves and with particles, and so it is rather handy to use the wave and particle ideas to get some understanding of what happens in given circumstances before we know the complete mathematics of the quantum-mechanical amplitudes."
19366,"We shall try to indicate the weakest places as we go along, but most of it is very nearly correct—it is just a matter of interpretation."
19367,"First of all, we know that the new way of representing the world in quantum mechanics—the new framework—is to give an amplitude for every event that can occur, and if the event involves the reception of one particle, then we can give the amplitude to find that one particle at different places and at different times."
19368,The probability of finding the particle is then proportional to the absolute square of the amplitude.
19369,"In general, the amplitude to find a particle in different places at different times varies with position and time."
19370,"(Do not forget that these amplitudes are complex numbers, not real numbers.)"
19371,This means that the idea of a particle is limited.
19372,"The idea of a particle—its location, its momentum, etc.—which we use so much, is in certain ways unsatisfactory."
19373,That means we do not know where it is—it can be anywhere—there is a great uncertainty in its location.
19374,"Outside this region, the probability is zero."
19375,"2–1), and the wavelength (the distance between nodes of the waves in the train) of that wave train is what corresponds to the particle momentum."
19376,Here we encounter a strange thing about waves; a very simple thing which has nothing to do with quantum mechanics strictly.
19377,"It is something that anybody who works with waves, even if he knows no quantum mechanics, knows: namely, we cannot define a unique wavelength for a short wave train."
19378,"Such a wave train does not have a definite wavelength; there is an indefiniteness in the wave number that is related to the finite length of the train, and thus there is an indefiniteness in the momentum."
19379,"Let us consider two examples of this idea—to see the reason that there is an uncertainty in the position and/or the momentum, if quantum mechanics is right."
19380,"We have also seen before that if there were not such a thing—if it were possible to measure the position and the momentum of anything simultaneously—we would have a paradox; it is fortunate that we do not have such a paradox, and the fact that such an uncertainty comes naturally from the wave picture shows that everything is mutually consistent."
19381,Here is one example which shows the relationship between the position and the momentum in a circumstance that is easy to understand.
19382,"Suppose we have a single slit, and particles are coming from very far away with a certain energy—so that they are all coming essentially horizontally (Fig."
19383,2–2).
19384,We are going to concentrate on the vertical components of momentum.
19385,"The particle is moving neither up nor down, because it came from a source that is far away—and so the vertical momentum is of course zero."
19386,"We once knew the momentum was horizontal, but we do not know it any more."
19387,"Before the particles passed through the hole, we did not know their vertical positions."
19388,"Now that we have found the vertical position by having the particle come through the hole, we have lost our information on the vertical momentum!"
19389,Why?
19390,"According to the wave theory, there is a spreading out, or diffraction, of the waves after they go through the slit, just as for light."
19391,Therefore there is a certain probability that particles coming out of the slit are not coming exactly straight.
19392,"The pattern is spread out by the diffraction effect, and the angle of spread, which we can define as the angle of the first minimum, is a measure of the uncertainty in the final angle."
19393,How does the pattern become spread?
19394,"To say it is spread means that there is some chance for the particle to be moving up or down, that is, to have a component of momentum up or down."
19395,I).
19396,"So the narrower we make the slit, the wider the pattern gets, and the more is the likelihood that we would find that the particle has sidewise momentum."
19397,Sometimes people say quantum mechanics is all wrong.
19398,"When the particle arrived from the left, its vertical momentum was zero."
19399,"And now that it has gone through the slit, its position is known."
19400,Both position and momentum seem to be known with arbitrary accuracy.
19401,"It is quite true that we can receive a particle, and on reception determine what its position is and what its momentum would have had to have been to have gotten there."
19402,"That is true, but that is not what the uncertainty relation (2.3) refers to."
19403,"Equation (2.3) refers to the predictability of a situation, not remarks about the past."
19404,"It does no good to say “I knew what the momentum was before it went through the slit, and now I know the position,” because now the momentum knowledge is lost."
19405,The fact that it went through the slit no longer permits us to predict the vertical momentum.
19406,"We are talking about a predictive theory, not just measurements after the fact."
19407,So we must talk about what we can predict.
19408,Now let us take the thing the other way around.
19409,"Let us take another example of the same phenomenon, a little more quantitatively."
19410,In the previous example we measured the momentum by a classical method.
19411,"Namely, we considered the direction and the velocity and the angles, etc., so we got the momentum by classical analysis."
19412,"But since momentum is related to wave number, there exists in nature still another way to measure the momentum of a particle—photon or otherwise—which has no classical analog, because it uses Eq."
19413,(2.2).
19414,We measure the wavelengths of the waves.
19415,Let us try to measure momentum in this way.
19416,Suppose we have a grating with a large number of lines (Fig.
19417,"2–3), and send a beam of particles at the grating."
19418,"We have often discussed this problem: if the particles have a definite momentum, then we get a very sharp pattern in a certain direction, because of the interference."
19419,"And we have also talked about how accurately we can determine that momentum, that is to say, what the resolving power of such a grating is."
19420,2–3.
19421,"This distance is the difference between the total distance that the particle or wave or whatever it is has to travel if it is reflected from the bottom of the grating, and the distance that it has to travel if it is reflected from the top of the grating."
19422,"That is, the waves which form the diffraction pattern are waves which come from different parts of the grating."
19423,"If the wave train is too short, we are not using the entire grating."
19424,"The waves which form the spectrum are being reflected from only a very short sector of the grating if the wave train is too short, and the grating will not work right—we will find a big angular spread."
19425,"In order to get a narrower one, we need to use the whole grating, so that at least at some moment the whole wave train is scattering simultaneously from all parts of the grating."
19426,It has nothing to do with quantum mechanics.
19427,"It is simply that if we have a finite train, we cannot count the waves in it very precisely."
19428,Let us try another way to see the reason for that.
19429,"This, then, is a limitation of the classical idea of momentum."
19430,"(Naturally, it has to be limited in some ways if we are going to represent particles by waves!)"
19431,It is nice that we have found a rule that gives us some idea of when there is a failure of classical ideas.
19432,Next let us consider the reflection of particle waves from a crystal.
19433,A crystal is a thick thing which has a whole lot of similar atoms—we will include some complications later—in a nice array.
19434,"The question is how to set the array so that we get a strong reflected maximum in a given direction for a given beam of, say, light (x-rays), electrons, neutrons, or anything else."
19435,"In order to obtain a strong reflection, the scattering from all of the atoms must be in phase."
19436,"There cannot be equal numbers in phase and out of phase, or the waves will cancel out."
19437,"The way to arrange things is to find the regions of constant phase, as we have already explained; they are planes which make equal angles with the initial and final directions (Fig."
19438,2–4).
19439,"If we consider two parallel planes, as in Fig."
19440,"2–4, the waves scattered from the two planes will be in phase, provided the difference in distance traveled by a wave front is an integral number of wavelengths."
19441,"If, on the other hand, there are other atoms of the same nature (equal in density) halfway between, then the intermediate planes will also scatter equally strongly and will interfere with the others and produce no effect."
19442,"As a matter of interest, actual crystals are not usually as simple as a single kind of atom repeated in a certain way."
19443,"Instead, if we make a two-dimensional analog, they are much like wallpaper, in which there is some kind of figure which repeats all over the wallpaper."
19444,"By “figure” we mean, in the case of atoms, some arrangement—calcium and a carbon and three oxygens, etc., for calcium carbonate, and so on—which may involve a relatively large number of atoms."
19445,"But whatever it is, the figure is repeated in a pattern."
19446,This basic figure is called a unit cell.
19447,The basic pattern of repetition defines what we call the lattice type; the lattice type can be immediately determined by looking at the reflections and seeing what their symmetry is.
19448,"In other words, where we find any reflections at all determines the lattice type, but in order to determine what is in each of the elements of the lattice one must take into account the intensity of the scattering at the various directions."
19449,"Which directions scatter depends on the type of lattice, but how strongly each scatters is determined by what is inside each unit cell, and in that way the structure of crystals is worked out."
19450,Two photographs of x-ray diffraction patterns are shown in Figs.
19451,"2–5 and 2–6; they illustrate scattering from rock salt and myoglobin, respectively."
19452,"This fact also has an interesting consequence in the case of piles which make neutrons (these are obviously particles, for anybody’s money!)."
19453,"If we take these neutrons and let them into a long block of graphite, the neutrons diffuse and work their way along (Fig."
19454,2–7).
19455,"They diffuse because they are bounced by the atoms, but strictly, in the wave theory, they are bounced by the atoms because of diffraction from the crystal planes."
19456,"It turns out that if we take a very long piece of graphite, the neutrons that come out the far end are all of long wavelength!"
19457,"In fact, if one plots the intensity as a function of wavelength, we get nothing except for wavelengths longer than a certain minimum (Fig."
19458,2–8).
19459,"In other words, we can get very slow neutrons that way."
19460,"Only the slowest neutrons come through; they are not diffracted or scattered by the crystal planes of the graphite, but keep going right through like light through glass, and are not scattered out the sides."
19461,There are many other demonstrations of the reality of neutron waves and waves of other particles.
19462,"We now consider another application of the uncertainty relation, Eq."
19463,(2.3).
19464,It must not be taken too seriously; the idea is right but the analysis is not very accurate.
19465,"The idea has to do with the determination of the size of atoms, and the fact that, classically, the electrons would radiate light and spiral in until they settle down right on top of the nucleus."
19466,But that cannot be right quantum-mechanically because then we would know where each electron was and how fast it was moving.
19467,"Suppose we have a hydrogen atom, and measure the position of the electron; we must not be able to predict exactly where the electron will be, or the momentum spread will then turn out to be infinite."
19468,"Every time we look at the electron, it is somewhere, but it has an amplitude to be in different places so there is a probability of it being found in different places."
19469,"This is pretty good—in fact, it is amazing, since until now we have had no basis for understanding the size of atoms!"
19470,"Atoms are completely impossible from the classical point of view, since the electrons would spiral into the nucleus."
19471,It means that the electron has less energy when it is in the atom than when it is free.
19472,It means it is bound.
19473,"However, we have cheated, we have used all the constants in such a way that it happens to come out the right number!"
19474,So we now understand why we do not fall through the floor.
19475,"As we walk, our shoes with their masses of atoms push against the floor with its mass of atoms."
19476,"In order to squash the atoms closer together, the electrons would be confined to a smaller space and, by the uncertainty principle, their momenta would have to be higher on the average, and that means high energy; the resistance to atomic compression is a quantum-mechanical effect and not a classical effect."
19477,"Classically, we would expect that if we were to draw all the electrons and protons closer together, the energy would be reduced still further, and the best arrangement of positive and negative charges in classical physics is all on top of each other."
19478,This was well known in classical physics and was a puzzle because of the existence of the atom.
19479,"Of course, the early scientists invented some ways out of the trouble—but never mind, we have the right way out, now!"
19480,"Incidentally, although we have no reason to understand it at the moment, in a situation where there are many electrons it turns out that they try to keep away from each other."
19481,"If one electron is occupying a certain space, then another does not occupy the same space."
19482,"More precisely, there are two spin cases, so that two can sit on top of each other, one spinning one way and one the other way."
19483,But after that we cannot put any more there.
19484,"We have to put others in another place, and that is the real reason that matter has strength."
19485,"If we could put all the electrons in the same place, it would condense even more than it does."
19486,It is the fact that the electrons cannot all get on top of each other that makes tables and everything else solid.
19487,"Obviously, in order to understand the properties of matter, we will have to use quantum mechanics and not be satisfied with classical mechanics."
19488,"We have talked about the atom in its lowest possible energy condition, but it turns out that the electron can do other things."
19489,"It can jiggle and wiggle in a more energetic manner, and so there are many different possible motions for the atom."
19490,"According to quantum mechanics, in a stationary condition there can only be definite energies for an atom."
19491,We make a diagram (Fig.
19492,"2–9) in which we plot the energy vertically, and we make a horizontal line for each allowed value of the energy."
19493,"When the electron is free, i.e., when its energy is positive, it can have any energy; it can be moving at any speed."
19494,But bound energies are not arbitrary.
19495,"The atom must have one or another out of a set of allowed values, such as those in Fig."
19496,2–9.
19497,Sooner or later it drops to a lower state and radiates energy in the form of light.
19498,The frequency of the light that is emitted is determined by conservation of energy plus the quantum-mechanical understanding that the frequency of the light is related to the energy of the light by (2.1).
19499,"This remarkable coincidence in spectral frequencies was noted before quantum mechanics was discovered, and it is called the Ritz combination principle."
19500,This is again a mystery from the point of view of classical mechanics.
19501,Let us not belabor the point that classical mechanics is a failure in the atomic domain; we seem to have demonstrated that pretty well.
19502,"We have already talked about quantum mechanics as being represented by amplitudes which behave like waves, with certain frequencies and wave numbers."
19503,Let us observe how it comes about from the point of view of amplitudes that the atom has definite energy states.
19504,"This is something we cannot understand from what has been said so far, but we are all familiar with the fact that confined waves have definite frequencies."
19505,"For instance, if sound is confined to an organ pipe, or anything like that, then there is more than one way that the sound can vibrate, but for each such way there is a definite frequency."
19506,Thus an object in which the waves are confined has certain resonance frequencies.
19507,It is therefore a property of waves in a confined space—a subject which we will discuss in detail with formulas later on—that they exist only at definite frequencies.
19508,"And since the general relation exists between frequencies of the amplitude and energy, we are not surprised to find definite energies associated with electrons bound in atoms."
19509,Let us consider briefly some philosophical implications of quantum mechanics.
19510,"As always, there are two aspects of the problem: one is the philosophical implication for physics, and the other is the extrapolation of philosophical matters to other fields."
19511,"When philosophical ideas associated with science are dragged into another field, they are usually completely distorted."
19512,Therefore we shall confine our remarks as much as possible to physics itself.
19513,"First of all, the most interesting aspect is the idea of the uncertainty principle; making an observation affects the phenomenon."
19514,"It has always been known that making observations affects a phenomenon, but the point is that the effect cannot be disregarded or minimized or decreased arbitrarily by rearranging the apparatus."
19515,"When we look for a certain phenomenon we cannot help but disturb it in a certain minimum way, and the disturbance is necessary for the consistency of the viewpoint."
19516,"The observer was sometimes important in prequantum physics, but only in a trivial sense."
19517,"The problem has been raised: if a tree falls in a forest and there is nobody there to hear it, does it make a noise?"
19518,"A real tree falling in a real forest makes a sound, of course, even if nobody is there."
19519,"Even if no one is present to hear it, there are other traces left."
19520,"The sound will shake some leaves, and if we were careful enough we might find somewhere that some thorn had rubbed against a leaf and made a tiny scratch that could not be explained unless we assumed the leaf were vibrating."
19521,So in a certain sense we would have to admit that there is a sound made.
19522,We might ask: was there a sensation of sound?
19523,"No, sensations have to do, presumably, with consciousness."
19524,"And whether ants are conscious and whether there were ants in the forest, or whether the tree was conscious, we do not know."
19525,Let us leave the problem in that form.
19526,Another thing that people have emphasized since quantum mechanics was developed is the idea that we should not speak about those things which we cannot measure.
19527,(Actually relativity theory also said this.)
19528,"Unless a thing can be defined by measurement, it has no place in a theory."
19529,And since an accurate value of the momentum of a localized particle cannot be defined by measurement it therefore has no place in the theory.
19530,The idea that this is what was the matter with classical theory is a false position.
19531,It is a careless analysis of the situation.
19532,Just because we cannot measure position and momentum precisely does not a priori mean that we cannot talk about them.
19533,It only means that we need not talk about them.
19534,The situation in the sciences is this: A concept or an idea which cannot be measured or cannot be referred directly to experiment may or may not be useful.
19535,It need not exist in a theory.
19536,"In other words, suppose we compare the classical theory of the world with the quantum theory of the world, and suppose that it is true experimentally that we can measure position and momentum only imprecisely."
19537,The question is whether the ideas of the exact position of a particle and the exact momentum of a particle are valid or not.
19538,The classical theory admits the ideas; the quantum theory does not.
19539,This does not in itself mean that classical physics is wrong.
19540,"When the new quantum mechanics was discovered, the classical people—which included everybody except Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and Born—said: “Look, your theory is not any good because you cannot answer certain questions like: what is the exact position of a particle?, which hole does it go through?, and some others.” Heisenberg’s answer was: “I do not need to answer such questions because you cannot ask such a question experimentally.” It is that we do not have to."
19541,"Consider two theories (a) and (b); (a) contains an idea that cannot be checked directly but which is used in the analysis, and the other, (b), does not contain the idea."
19542,"If they disagree in their predictions, one could not claim that (b) is false because it cannot explain this idea that is in (a), because that idea is one of the things that cannot be checked directly."
19543,"It is always good to know which ideas cannot be checked directly, but it is not necessary to remove them all."
19544,It is not true that we can pursue science completely by using only those concepts which are directly subject to experiment.
19545,"In quantum mechanics itself there is a probability amplitude, there is a potential, and there are many constructs that we cannot measure directly."
19546,The basis of a science is its ability to predict.
19547,To predict means to tell what will happen in an experiment that has never been done.
19548,How can we do that?
19549,"By assuming that we know what is there, independent of the experiment."
19550,We must extrapolate the experiments to a region where they have not been done.
19551,We must take our concepts and extend them to places where they have not yet been checked.
19552,"If we do not do that, we have no prediction."
19553,So it was perfectly sensible for the classical physicists to go happily along and suppose that the position—which obviously means something for a baseball—meant something also for an electron.
19554,It was not stupidity.
19555,It was a sensible procedure.
19556,"Today we say that the law of relativity is supposed to be true at all energies, but someday somebody may come along and say how stupid we were."
19557,"We do not know where we are “stupid” until we “stick our neck out,” and so the whole idea is to put our neck out."
19558,And the only way to find out that we are wrong is to find out what our predictions are.
19559,It is absolutely necessary to make constructs.
19560,We have already made a few remarks about the indeterminacy of quantum mechanics.
19561,"That is, that we are unable now to predict what will happen in physics in a given physical circumstance which is arranged as carefully as possible."
19562,"If we have an atom that is in an excited state and so is going to emit a photon, we cannot say when it will emit the photon."
19563,"It has a certain amplitude to emit the photon at any time, and we can predict only a probability for emission; we cannot predict the future exactly."
19564,"This has given rise to all kinds of nonsense and questions on the meaning of freedom of will, and of the idea that the world is uncertain."
19565,"Of course we must emphasize that classical physics is also indeterminate, in a sense."
19566,"It is usually thought that this indeterminacy, that we cannot predict the future, is an important quantum-mechanical thing, and this is said to explain the behavior of the mind, feelings of free will, etc."
19567,But if the world were classical—if the laws of mechanics were classical—it is not quite obvious that the mind would not feel more or less the same.
19568,"It is true classically that if we knew the position and the velocity of every particle in the world, or in a box of gas, we could predict exactly what would happen."
19569,And therefore the classical world is deterministic.
19570,"Suppose, however, that we have a finite accuracy and do not know exactly where just one atom is, say to one part in a billion."
19571,"Then as it goes along it hits another atom, and because we did not know the position better than to one part in a billion, we find an even larger error in the position after the collision."
19572,"And that is amplified, of course, in the next collision, so that if we start with only a tiny error it rapidly magnifies to a very great uncertainty."
19573,"To give an example: if water falls over a dam, it splashes."
19574,"If we stand nearby, every now and then a drop will land on our nose."
19575,"This appears to be completely random, yet such a behavior would be predicted by purely classical laws."
19576,The exact position of all the drops depends upon the precise wigglings of the water before it goes over the dam.
19577,How?
19578,"The tiniest irregularities are magnified in falling, so that we get complete randomness."
19579,"Obviously, we cannot really predict the position of the drops unless we know the motion of the water absolutely exactly."
19580,"Speaking more precisely, given an arbitrary accuracy, no matter how precise, one can find a time long enough that we cannot make predictions valid for that long a time."
19581,Now the point is that this length of time is not very large.
19582,It is not that the time is millions of years if the accuracy is one part in a billion.
19583,"The time goes, in fact, only logarithmically with the error, and it turns out that in only a very, very tiny time we lose all our information."
19584,"If the accuracy is taken to be one part in billions and billions and billions—no matter how many billions we wish, provided we do stop somewhere—then we can find a time less than the time it took to state the accuracy—after which we can no longer predict what is going to happen!"
19585,"It is therefore not fair to say that from the apparent freedom and indeterminacy of the human mind, we should have realized that classical “deterministic” physics could not ever hope to understand it, and to welcome quantum mechanics as a release from a “completely mechanistic” universe."
19586,For already in classical mechanics there was indeterminability from a practical point of view.
19587,"When Schrödinger first discovered the correct laws of quantum mechanics, he wrote an equation which described the amplitude to find a particle in various places."
19588,"This equation was very similar to the equations that were already known to classical physicists—equations that they had used in describing the motion of air in a sound wave, the transmission of light, and so on."
19589,So most of the time at the beginning of quantum mechanics was spent in solving this equation.
19590,"But at the same time an understanding was being developed, particularly by Born and Dirac, of the basically new physical ideas behind quantum mechanics."
19591,"As quantum mechanics developed further, it turned out that there were a large number of things which were not directly encompassed in the Schrödinger equation—such as the spin of the electron, and various relativistic phenomena."
19592,"Traditionally, all courses in quantum mechanics have begun in the same way, retracing the path followed in the historical development of the subject."
19593,One first learns a great deal about classical mechanics so that he will be able to understand how to solve the Schrödinger equation.
19594,Then he spends a long time working out various solutions.
19595,Only after a detailed study of this equation does he get to the “advanced” subject of the electron’s spin.
19596,"We had also originally considered that the right way to conclude these lectures on physics was to show how to solve the equations of classical physics in complicated situations—such as the description of sound waves in enclosed regions, modes of electromagnetic radiation in cylindrical cavities, and so on."
19597,That was the original plan for this course.
19598,"However, we have decided to abandon that plan and to give instead an introduction to the quantum mechanics."
19599,"We have come to the conclusion that what are usually called the advanced parts of quantum mechanics are, in fact, quite simple."
19600,"The mathematics that is involved is particularly simple, involving simple algebraic operations and no differential equations or at most only very simple ones."
19601,The only problem is that we must jump the gap of no longer being able to describe the behavior in detail of particles in space.
19602,So this is what we are going to try to do: to tell you about what conventionally would be called the “advanced” parts of quantum mechanics.
19603,"But they are, we assure you, by all odds the simplest parts—in a deep sense of the word—as well as the most basic parts."
19604,"This is frankly a pedagogical experiment; it has never been done before, as far as we know."
19605,"In this subject we have, of course, the difficulty that the quantum mechanical behavior of things is quite strange."
19606,"Nobody has an everyday experience to lean on to get a rough, intuitive idea of what will happen."
19607,"So there are two ways of presenting the subject: We could either describe what can happen in a rather rough physical way, telling you more or less what happens without giving the precise laws of everything; or we could, on the other hand, give the precise laws in their abstract form."
19608,"But, then because of the abstractions, you wouldn’t know what they were all about, physically."
19609,"The latter method is unsatisfactory because it is completely abstract, and the first way leaves an uncomfortable feeling because one doesn’t know exactly what is true and what is false."
19610,We are not sure how to overcome this difficulty.
19611,"You will notice, in fact, that Chapters 1 and 2 showed this problem."
19612,The first chapter was relatively precise; but the second chapter was a rough description of the characteristics of different phenomena.
19613,"Here, we will try to find a happy medium between the two extremes."
19614,We will begin in this chapter by dealing with some general quantum mechanical ideas.
19615,"Some of the statements will be quite precise, others only partially precise."
19616,"It will be hard to tell you as we go along which is which, but by the time you have finished the rest of the book, you will understand in looking back which parts hold up and which parts were only explained roughly."
19617,The chapters which follow this one will not be so imprecise.
19618,"In fact, one of the reasons we have tried carefully to be precise in the succeeding chapters is so that we can show you one of the most beautiful things about quantum mechanics—how much can be deduced from so little."
19619,We begin by discussing again the superposition of probability amplitudes.
19620,"As an example we will refer to the experiment described in Chapter 1, and shown again here in Fig."
19621,3–1.
19622,Sometimes it will also be convenient to abbreviate still more and describe the initial and final conditions by single letters.
19623,"We have already seen in the discussion of Chapter 1 that when there are two ways for the particle to reach the detector, the resulting probability is not the sum of the two probabilities, but must be written as the absolute square of the sum of two amplitudes."
19624,"First, however, we want to state our second general principle of quantum mechanics: When a particle can reach a given state by two possible routes, the total amplitude for the process is the sum of the amplitudes for the two routes considered separately."
19625,"We could, of course, split each hole into pieces with a certain amplitude that the electron goes to the top of the hole and the bottom of the hole and so on."
19626,We will suppose that the hole is small enough so that we don’t have to worry about this detail.
19627,"That is part of the roughness involved; the matter can be made more precise, but we don’t want to do so at this stage."
19628,We can do that by using our third general principle: When a particle goes by some particular route the amplitude for that route can be written as the product of the amplitude to go part way with the amplitude to go the rest of the way.
19629,For the setup of Fig.
19630,You will note that Eq.
19631,(3.5) appears to be written in reverse order.
19632,"In summary, if events occur in succession—that is, if you can analyze one of the routes of the particle by saying it does this, then it does this, then it does that—the resultant amplitude for that route is calculated by multiplying in succession the amplitude for each of the successive events."
19633,Using this law we can rewrite Eq.
19634,Now we wish to show that just using these principles we can calculate a much more complicated problem like the one shown in Fig.
19635,3–2.
19636,"Well, one way you can find this is by calculating the superposition, or interference, of the waves that go through; but you can also do it by saying that there are six possible routes and superposing an amplitude for each."
19637,"On the other hand, using the third principle, each of these separate amplitudes can be written as a product of three amplitudes."
19638,"In order to make any calculations using these methods, it is, naturally, necessary to know the amplitude to get from one place to another."
19639,We will give a rough idea of a typical amplitude.
19640,"It leaves out certain things like the polarization of light or the spin of the electron, but aside from such features it is quite accurate."
19641,We give it so that you can solve problems involving various combinations of slits.
19642,"In other words, it is a free particle with no forces on it."
19643,"In the most general case, the amplitude and the corresponding probability will also involve the time."
19644,For most of these initial discussions we will suppose that the source always emits the particles with a given energy so we will not need to worry about the time.
19645,"But we could, in the general case, be interested in some other questions."
19646,You will get different results if you put the detector in different places and measure at different times.
19647,"For example, in a nonrelativistic case it is the Schrödinger equation."
19648,One has then a wave equation analogous to the equation for electromagnetic waves or waves of sound in a gas.
19649,"However, it must be emphasized that the wave function that satisfies the equation is not like a real wave in space; one cannot picture any kind of reality to this wave as one does for a sound wave."
19650,"If we are, for example, dealing with two (or more) particles, we will need the following additional principle: Provided that the two particles do not interact, the amplitude that one particle will do one thing and the other one something else is the product of the two amplitudes that the two particles would do the two things separately."
19651,There is one more point to emphasize.
19652,Suppose that we didn’t know where the particles in Fig.
19653,"In other words, because of the fact that the amplitude for successive events multiplies, as shown in Eq."
19654,These two complex numbers are enough to predict all the future.
19655,That is what really makes quantum mechanics easy.
19656,It turns out that in later chapters we are going to do just such a thing when we specify a starting condition in terms of two (or a few) numbers.
19657,"Of course, these numbers depend upon where the source is located and possibly other details about the apparatus, but given the two numbers, we do not need to know any more about such details."
19658,Now we would like to consider a matter which was discussed in some detail in Chapter 1.
19659,This time we will do it with the full glory of the amplitude idea to show you how it works out.
19660,We take the same experiment shown in Fig.
19661,"3–1, but now with the addition of a light source behind the two holes, as shown in Fig."
19662,3–3.
19663,"In Chapter 1, we discovered the following interesting result."
19664,This was true at least if we used light of short enough wavelength.
19665,"If the wavelength was made longer so we could not be sure at which hole the scattering had occurred, the distribution became more like the one with the light turned off."
19666,Let’s examine what is happening by using our new notation and the principles of combining amplitudes.
19667,Let’s try to calculate them.
19668,"Although we don’t have the correct mathematical formula for all the factors that go into this calculation, you will see the spirit of it in the following discussion."
19669,Now we are finished.
19670,We can easily calculate the probability for various situations.
19671,That will be the absolute square of the amplitude given in Eq.
19672,Let’s look more carefully at this expression.
19673,This is the probability distribution that you would get if there were only one hole—as shown in the graph of Fig.
19674,3–4(a).
19675,"This, however, is just the probability distribution we would have gotten without the photons at all."
19676,"Therefore, in the case that the wavelength is very long—and the photon detection ineffective—you return to the original distribution curve which shows interference effects, as shown in Fig."
19677,3–4(b).
19678,3–4(c).
19679,"If you remember the discussion in Chapter 1, you will see that these results give a quantitative description of what was described there."
19680,Now we would like to emphasize an important point so that you will avoid a common error.
19681,Should you add the amplitudes given in Eqs.
19682,(3.8) and (3.9)?
19683,No!
19684,You must never add amplitudes for different and distinct final states.
19685,"Once the photon is accepted by one of the photon counters, we can always determine which alternative occurred if we want, without any further disturbance to the system."
19686,Each alternative has a probability completely independent of the other.
19687,"To repeat, do not add amplitudes for different final conditions, where by “final” we mean at that moment the probability is desired—that is, when the experiment is “finished.” You do add the amplitudes for the different indistinguishable alternatives inside the experiment, before the complete process is finished."
19688,"At the end of the process you may say that you “don’t want to look at the photon.” That’s your business, but you still do not add the amplitudes."
19689,"Nature does not know what you are looking at, and she behaves the way she is going to behave whether you bother to take down the data or not."
19690,So here we must not add the amplitudes.
19691,We first square the amplitudes for all possible different final events and then sum.
19692,Our next example is a phenomenon in which we have to analyze the interference of probability amplitudes somewhat carefully.
19693,We look at the process of the scattering of neutrons from a crystal.
19694,"Suppose we have a crystal which has a lot of atoms with nuclei at their centers, arranged in a periodic array, and a neutron beam that comes from far away."
19695,The problem is to calculate the probability of getting a neutron into a counter with the arrangement shown in Fig.
19696,3–5.
19697,We have here a large number of apparently indistinguishable routes.
19698,They are indistinguishable because a low-energy neutron is scattered from a nucleus without knocking the atom out of its place in the crystal—no “record” is left of the scattering.
19699,"The neutron intensity as a function of angle in such an experiment is indeed often found to show tremendous variations, with very sharp interference peaks and almost nothing in between—as shown in Fig."
19700,3–6(a).
19701,"However, for certain kinds of crystals it does not work this way, and there is—along with the interference peaks discussed above—a general background of scattering in all directions."
19702,We must try to understand the apparently mysterious reasons for this.
19703,"Well, we have not considered one important property of the neutron."
19704,"It has a spin of one-half, and so there are two conditions in which it can be: either spin “up” (say perpendicular to the page in Fig."
19705,"3–5) or spin “down.”  If the nuclei of the crystal have no spin, the neutron spin doesn’t have any effect."
19706,"But when the nuclei of the crystal also have a spin, say a spin of one-half, you will observe the background of smeared-out scattering described above."
19707,The explanation is as follows.
19708,"If the neutron has one direction of spin and the atomic nucleus has the same spin, then no change of spin can occur in the scattering process."
19709,"If the neutron and atomic nucleus have opposite spin, then scattering can occur by two processes, one in which the spins are unchanged and another in which the spin directions are exchanged."
19710,This rule for no net change of the sum of the spins is analogous to our classical law of conservation of angular momentum.
19711,We can begin to understand the phenomenon if we assume that all the scattering nuclei are set up with spins in one direction.
19712,A neutron with the same spin will scatter with the expected sharp interference distribution.
19713,What about one with opposite spin?
19714,"If it scatters without spin flip, then nothing is changed from the above; but if the two spins flip over in the scattering, we could, in principle, find out which nucleus had done the scattering, since it would be the only one with spin turned over."
19715,"Well, if we can tell which atom did the scattering, what have the other atoms got to do with it?"
19716,"Nothing, of course."
19717,The scattering is exactly the same as that from a single atom.
19718,"To include this effect, the mathematical formulation of Eq."
19719,(3.12) must be modified since we haven’t described the states completely in that analysis.
19720,Let’s start with all neutrons from the source having spin up and all the nuclei of the crystal having spin down.
19721,"First, we would like the amplitude that at the counter the spin of the neutron is up and all spins of the crystal are still down."
19722,This is not different from our previous discussion.
19723,There is clearly no way to tell which atom did the scattering.
19724,"For this process, all the amplitudes interfere."
19725,"(In a real crystal there is the disagreeable possibility that the reversed spin moves to some other atom, but let’s take the case of a crystal for which this probability is very low.)"
19726,"The second factor is almost independent of location in the crystal, and all phases have disappeared in taking the absolute square."
19727,3–6(b).
19728,"You may argue, “I don’t care which atom is up.” Perhaps you don’t, but nature knows; and the probability is, in fact, what we gave above—there isn’t any interference."
19729,"If we do an experiment in which we don’t observe the spin of the detected neutron, then both kinds of events can occur; and the separate probabilities add."
19730,The total probability (or counting rate) as a function of angle then looks like the graph in Fig.
19731,3–6(c).
19732,Let’s review the physics of this experiment.
19733,"If you could, in principle, distinguish the alternative final states (even though you do not bother to do so), the total, final probability is obtained by calculating the probability for each state (not the amplitude) and then adding them together."
19734,"If you cannot distinguish the final states even in principle, then the probability amplitudes must be summed before taking the absolute square to find the actual probability."
19735,"The thing you should notice particularly is that if you were to try to represent the neutron by a wave alone, you would get the same kind of distribution for the scattering of a down-spinning neutron as for an up-spinning neutron."
19736,You would have to say that the “wave” would come from all the different atoms and interfere just as for the up-spinning one with the same wavelength.
19737,But we know that is not the way it works.
19738,"So as we stated earlier, we must be careful not to attribute too much reality to the waves in space."
19739,They are useful for certain problems but not for all.
19740,The next experiment we will describe is one which shows one of the beautiful consequences of quantum mechanics.
19741,"It again involves a physical situation in which a thing can happen in two indistinguishable ways, so that there is an interference of amplitudes—as is always true in such circumstances."
19742,"We are going to discuss the scattering, at relatively low energy, of nuclei on other nuclei."
19743,See Fig.
19744,3–7(a).
19745,"(The magnitudes of the velocities are, of course, different, since the masses are different.)"
19746,We will also suppose that there is conservation of energy and that the collision energy is low enough that neither particle is broken up or left in an excited state.
19747,"The reason that the two particles deflect each other is, of course, that each particle carries a positive charge and, classically speaking, there is an electrical repulsion as they go by."
19748,"The scattering will happen at different angles with different probabilities, and we would like to discuss something about the angle dependence of such scatterings."
19749,"(It is possible, of course, to calculate this thing classically, and it is one of the most remarkable accidents of quantum mechanics that the answer to this problem comes out the same as it does classically."
19750,This is a curious point because it happens for no other force except the inverse square law—so it is indeed an accident.)
19751,The probability of scattering in different directions can be measured by an experiment as shown in Fig.
19752,3–7(a).
19753,(In the laboratory system the detectors would not be opposite; but in the CM system they are.)
19754,Our experiment consists in measuring the probability of scattering in various directions.
19755,Then we have to work out what happens when we do not bother to distinguish which particles are counted.
19756,3–7(b).
19757,"Even though in this experiment we do not distinguish them, we could."
19758,"According to the earlier discussion, then, we must add the probabilities, not the amplitudes."
19759,"For the one case in which both particles are exactly the same, the experimental data disagree with the prediction of (3.14)."
19760,Perhaps you can already see the explanation.
19761,How can we tell whether the bombarding particle or the target particle entered the counter?
19762,The answer is that we cannot.
19763,This is quite a different result than that in Eq.
19764,(3.14).
19765,"On the other hand, if they did not interfere, the result of Eq."
19766,"Of course, at other angles the results will also be different."
19767,"And so you have the unusual result that when particles are identical, a certain new thing happens that doesn’t happen when particles can be distinguished."
19768,In the mathematical description you must add the amplitudes for alternative process in which the two particles simply exchange roles and there is an interference.
19769,"An even more perplexing thing happens when we do the same kind of experiment by scattering electrons on electrons, or protons on protons."
19770,Neither of the above results is then correct!
19771,"For these particles, we must invoke still a new rule, a most peculiar rule, which is the following: When you have a situation in which the identity of the electron which is arriving at a point is exchanged with another one, the new amplitude interferes with the old one with an opposite phase."
19772,"It is interference all right, but with a minus sign."
19773,"In the case of electrons, the interfering amplitudes for exchange interfere with a negative sign."
19774,"Except for another detail to be discussed below, the proper equation for electrons in an experiment like the one shown in Fig."
19775,The electron spin may be considered to be either “up” or “down” with respect to the plane of the scattering.
19776,"If the energy of the experiment is low enough, the magnetic forces due to the currents will be small and the spin will not be affected."
19777,"We will assume that this is the case for the present analysis, so that there is no chance that the spins are changed during the collision."
19778,"Whatever spin the electron has, it carries along with it."
19779,Now you see there are many possibilities.
19780,"The bombarding and target particles can have both spins up, both down, or opposite spins."
19781,"If both spins are up, as in Fig."
19782,"3–8 (or if both spins are down), the same will be true of the recoil particles and the amplitude for the process is the difference of the amplitudes for the two possibilities shown in Fig."
19783,3–8(a) and (b).
19784,(3.16).
19785,"Suppose, however, the “bombarding” spin is up and the “target” spin is down."
19786,The two possibilities are shown in Fig.
19787,"3–9(a) and (b); they are distinguishable in principle, and hence there will be no interference—merely an addition of the two probabilities."
19788,"The same argument holds if both of the original spins are reversed—that is, if the left-hand spin is down and the right-hand spin is up."
19789,Now if we take our electrons at random—as from a tungsten filament in which the electrons are completely unpolarized—then the odds are fifty-fifty that any particular electron comes out with spin up or spin down.
19790,"If we don’t bother to measure the spin of the electrons at any point in the experiment, we have what we call an unpolarized experiment."
19791,The results for this experiment are best calculated by listing all of the various possibilities as we have done in Table 3–1.
19792,A separate probability is computed for each distinguishable alternative.
19793,The total probability is then the sum of all the separate probabilities.
19794,The behavior of identical particles has many interesting consequences; we will discuss them in greater detail in the next chapter.
19795,In the last chapter we began to consider the special rules for the interference that occurs in processes with two identical particles.
19796,By identical particles we mean things like electrons which can in no way be distinguished one from another.
19797,"If a process involves two particles that are identical, reversing which one arrives at a counter is an alternative which cannot be distinguished and—like all cases of alternatives which cannot be distinguished—interferes with the original, unexchanged case."
19798,"The amplitude for an event is then the sum of the two interfering amplitudes; but, interestingly enough, the interference is in some cases with the same phase and, in others, with the opposite phase."
19799,4–1(a).
19800,4–1(b).
19801,"But that is not necessarily so, because there could be an arbitrary phase factor."
19802,Then the two different processes shown in the two diagrams of Fig.
19803,4–1 cannot be distinguished.
19804,This amplitude is the sum of the amplitudes for the two processes shown in Fig.
19805,4–1.
19806,Suppose we have to multiply the amplitude by a certain phase factor when we exchange the roles of the two particles.
19807,If we exchange them again we should get the same factor again.
19808,But we are then back to the first process.
19809,"Either the exchanged case contributes with the same sign, or it contributes with the opposite sign."
19810,"Both cases exist in nature, each for a different class of particles."
19811,Particles which interfere with a positive sign are called Bose particles and those which interfere with a negative sign are called Fermi particles.
19812,"The Bose particles are the photon, the mesons, and the graviton."
19813,"The Fermi particles are the electron, the muon, the neutrinos, the nucleons, and the baryons."
19814,For particles with spin—like electrons—there is an additional complication.
19815,We must specify not only the location of the particles but the direction of their spins.
19816,It is only for identical particles with identical spin states that the amplitudes interfere when the particles are exchanged.
19817,If you think of the scattering of unpolarized beams—which are a mixture of different spin states—there is some extra arithmetic.
19818,Now an interesting problem arises when there are two or more particles bound tightly together.
19819,See Fig.
19820,4–2.
19821,"The amplitude for scattering with an exchange of a pair of neutrons will interfere with the amplitude for scattering with no such exchange, and the interference must be with a minus sign because there has been an exchange of one pair of Fermi particles."
19822,"In such circumstances, there are only two contributions to the scattering amplitude."
19823,"Either there is no exchange, or all four of the nucleons are exchanged in the scattering."
19824,"There is a change in sign for each pair, so the net result is that the amplitudes combine with a positive sign."
19825,"So the rule is that composite objects, in circumstances in which the composite object can be considered as a single object, behave like Fermi particles or Bose particles, depending on whether they contain an odd number or an even number of Fermi particles."
19826,"If several such Fermi particles are put together to form a composite object, the resulting spin may be either integral or half-integral."
19827,"We will learn later the rules for compounding angular momentum, and will just mention now that every composite object which has a half-integral spin imitates a Fermi particle, whereas every composite object with an integral spin imitates a Bose particle."
19828,"This brings up an interesting question: Why is it that particles with half-integral spin are Fermi particles whose amplitudes add with the minus sign, whereas particles with integral spin are Bose particles whose amplitudes add with the positive sign?"
19829,We apologize for the fact that we cannot give you an elementary explanation.
19830,An explanation has been worked out by Pauli from complicated arguments of quantum field theory and relativity.
19831,"He has shown that the two must necessarily go together, but we have not been able to find a way of reproducing his arguments on an elementary level."
19832,"It appears to be one of the few places in physics where there is a rule which can be stated very simply, but for which no one has found a simple and easy explanation."
19833,The explanation is deep down in relativistic quantum mechanics.
19834,This probably means that we do not have a complete understanding of the fundamental principle involved.
19835,"For the moment, you will just have to take it as one of the rules of the world."
19836,Now we would like to discuss an interesting consequence of the addition rule for Bose particles.
19837,It has to do with their behavior when there are several particles present.
19838,We begin by considering a situation in which two Bose particles are scattered from two different scatterers.
19839,We won’t worry about the details of the scattering mechanism.
19840,We are interested only in what happens to the scattered particles.
19841,Suppose we have the situation shown in Fig.
19842,4–3.
19843,"By a state we mean a given direction and energy, or some other given condition."
19844,"(What we really want to find out eventually is the amplitude that the two particles are scattered into identical directions, or states; but it is best if we think first about what happens if the states are almost the same and then work out what happens when they become identical.)"
19845,Imagine now that we have a pair of tiny counters that pick up the two scattered particles.
19846,In this case the amplitudes for the two different processes can interfere.
19847,"Although we have been considering that the two particles are observed in separate counters, this is not essential—as we can see in the following way."
19848,(We imagine that the counter presents a surface at right angles to the line from the scatterings.)
19849,Now we cannot give a probability that a particle will go into a precise direction or to a particular point in space.
19850,Such a thing is impossible—the chance for any exact direction is zero.
19851,"When we want to be so specific, we shall have to define our amplitudes so that they give the probability of arriving per unit area of a counter."
19852,"(When we had two different particles above—although we did not in fact care which particle went where in the counter—we could, in principle, have found out; so there was no interference."
19853,"For identical particles we cannot tell, even in principle.)"
19854,(4.12) for distinguishable particles.
19855,"It is a property of Bose particles that if there is already one particle in a condition of some kind, the probability of getting a second one in the same condition is twice as great as it would be if the first one were not already there."
19856,"(This is not a proper way of stating the result from the physical point of view we have taken, but if it is used consistently as a rule, it will, of course, give the correct result.)"
19857,We imagine the circumstance shown in Fig.
19858,4–4.
19859,They all act independently—the probability for one to enter does not depend on how many others are also entering.
19860,Now suppose that all the particles are identical Bose particles.
19861,So Eq.
19862,The presence of the other particles increases the probability of getting one more.
19863,"But that is not essential; we could have been speaking of the creation of particles, as for instance the emission of light."
19864,"When the light is emitted, a photon is “created.” In such a case, we don’t need the incoming lines in Fig."
19865,4–5.
19866,"It is, of course, another way of saying the same thing if it is understood to mean that this amplitude is just to be squared to get the probability."
19867,We can use it to find out how photons are scattered or absorbed out of a given state.
19868,Using Eq.
19869,(4.26).
19870,"Here’s the way to remember: The factor is always the square root of the largest number of photons present, whether it is before or after the reaction."
19871,Equations (4.25) and (4.26) show that the law is really symmetric—it only appears unsymmetric if you write it as Eq.
19872,(4.27).
19873,There are many physical consequences of these new rules; we want to describe one of them having to do with the emission of light.
19874,Suppose we imagine a situation in which photons are contained in a box—you can imagine a box with mirrors for walls.
19875,We have already discussed these rules in a somewhat different way in Chapter 42 of Vol.
19876,I.
19877,Equation (4.29) says that the probability that an atom will absorb a photon and make a transition to a higher energy state is proportional to the intensity of the light shining on it.
19878,"But, as Einstein first pointed out, the rate at which an atom will make a transition downward has two parts."
19879,"Furthermore, as Einstein said, the coefficients of absorption and of induced emission are equal and are related to the probability of spontaneous emission."
19880,"What we learn here is that if the light intensity is measured in terms of the number of photons present (instead of as the energy per unit area, and per sec), the coefficients of absorption, of induced emission, and of spontaneous emission are all equal."
19881,"I, Eq."
19882,(42.18).
19883,"We would like to use our rules for Bose particles to discuss once more the spectrum of blackbody radiation (see Chapter 42, Vol."
19884,I).
19885,We will do it by finding out how many photons there are in a box if the radiation is in thermal equilibrium with some atoms in the box.
19886,See Fig.
19887,4–6.
19888,We’ll call the lower-energy state the “ground” state and the upper state the “excited” state.
19889,"Each atom in the ground state can absorb a photon and go into the excited state, and each atom in the excited state can emit a photon and go to the ground state."
19890,"In equilibrium, the rates for these two processes must be equal."
19891,The rates are proportional to the probability for the event and to the number of atoms present.
19892,"Incidentally, we once found a similar equation in another context [Chapter 41, Vol."
19893,"I, Eq."
19894,(41.15)].
19895,4–7.
19896,(4.33).
19897,"Yet this equation was derived here for photons, by counting particles, and it gives the same results."
19898,That is one of the marvelous miracles of quantum mechanics.
19899,By such an oscillator we mean a dynamic system like a weight on a spring or a standing wave in a resonant cavity.
19900,And that is why it is possible to represent the electromagnetic field by photon particles.
19901,"From one point of view, we can analyze the electromagnetic field in a box or cavity in terms of a lot of harmonic oscillators, treating each mode of oscillation according to quantum mechanics as a harmonic oscillator."
19902,"From a different point of view, we can analyze the same physics in terms of identical Bose particles."
19903,And the results of both ways of working are always in exact agreement.
19904,There is no way to make up your mind whether the electromagnetic field is really to be described as a quantized harmonic oscillator or by giving how many photons there are in each condition.
19905,The two views turn out to be mathematically identical.
19906,So in the future we can speak either about the number of photons in a particular state in a box or the number of the energy level associated with a particular mode of oscillation of the electromagnetic field.
19907,They are two ways of saying the same thing.
19908,The same is true of photons in free space.
19909,They are equivalent to oscillations of a cavity whose walls have receded to infinity.
19910,"(We assume that for every mode there are some atoms in the box—or in the walls—which have energy levels that can radiate into that mode, so that each mode can get into thermal equilibrium.)"
19911,"Although this question continually comes up in quantum mechanics, it is purely a classical question about standing waves."
19912,We will get the answer only for a rectangular box.
19913,"It comes out the same for a box of any shape, but it’s very complicated to compute for the arbitrary case."
19914,"Also, we are only interested in a box whose dimensions are very large compared with a wavelength of the light."
19915,Let’s start by asking how many modes there are in a one-dimensional case—as for waves on a stretched string.
19916,"You know that each mode is a sine wave that has to go to zero at both ends; in other words, there must be an integral number of half-wavelengths in the length of the line, as shown in Fig."
19917,4–8.
19918,"But a “mode” is a standing wave which is the sum of two waves, one going in each direction."
19919,"Of course, we are not then describing standing waves very well, but we are counting modes in a consistent way."
19920,Now we want to extend the results to three dimensions.
19921,A standing wave in a rectangular box must have an integral number of half-waves along each axis.
19922,The situation for two of the dimensions is shown in Fig.
19923,4–9.
19924,(4.34).
19925,We are just interested in the energy in various modes—but not interested in the directions of the waves.
19926,We would like to know the number of modes in a given range of frequencies.
19927,There is one more complication.
19928,"Since these modes are independent, we must—for light—double the number of modes."
19929,I.
19930,The spectrum is plotted in Fig.
19931,4–10.
19932,"You see now that the answer depends on the fact that photons are Bose particles, which have a tendency to try to get all into the same state (because the amplitude for doing so is large)."
19933,"You will remember, it was Planck’s study of the blackbody spectrum (which was a mystery to classical physics), and his discovery of the formula in Eq."
19934,(4.43) that started the whole subject of quantum mechanics.
19935,"Liquid helium has at low temperatures many odd properties which we cannot unfortunately take the time to describe in detail right now, but many of them arise from the fact that a helium atom is a Bose particle."
19936,One of the things is that liquid helium flows without any viscous resistance.
19937,"It is, in fact, the ideal “dry” water we have been talking about in one of the earlier chapters—provided that the velocities are low enough."
19938,The reason is the following.
19939,"In order for a liquid to have viscosity, there must be internal energy losses; there must be some way for one part of the liquid to have a motion that is different from that of the rest of the liquid."
19940,This means that it must be possible to knock some of the atoms into states that are different from the states occupied by other atoms.
19941,"But at sufficiently low temperatures, when the thermal motions get very small, all the atoms try to get into the same condition."
19942,"So, if some of them are moving along, then all the atoms try to move together in the same state."
19943,"There is a kind of rigidity to the motion, and it is hard to break the motion up into irregular patterns of turbulence, as would happen, for example, with independent particles."
19944,"This cooperative motion does not happen at high temperatures, because then there is sufficient thermal energy to put the various atoms into various different higher states."
19945,But at a sufficiently low temperature there suddenly comes a moment in which all the helium atoms try to go into the same state.
19946,The helium becomes a superfluid.
19947,Fermi particles act in a completely different way.
19948,Let’s see what happens if we try to put two Fermi particles into the same state.
19949,We will go back to our original example and ask for the amplitude that two identical Fermi particles will be scattered into almost exactly the same direction.
19950,(4.44) becomes zero.
19951,The result for Fermi particles is much simpler than for Bose particles.
19952,It just isn’t possible at all for two Fermi particles—such as two electrons—to get into exactly the same state.
19953,You will never find two electrons in the same position with their two spins in the same direction.
19954,It is not possible for two electrons to have the same momentum and the same spin directions.
19955,"If they are at the same location or with the same state of motion, the only possibility is that they must be spinning opposite to each other."
19956,What are the consequences of this?
19957,There are a number of most remarkable effects which are a consequence of the fact that two Fermi particles cannot get into the same state.
19958,"In fact, almost all the peculiarities of the material world hinge on this wonderful fact."
19959,The variety that is represented in the periodic table is basically a consequence of this one rule.
19960,"Of course, we cannot say what the world would be like if this one rule were changed, because it is just a part of the whole structure of quantum mechanics, and it is impossible to say what else would change if the rule about Fermi particles were different."
19961,"Anyway, let’s just try to see what would happen if only this one rule were changed."
19962,"First, we can show that every atom would be more or less the same."
19963,Let’s start with the hydrogen atom.
19964,It would not be noticeably affected.
19965,"The proton of the nucleus would be surrounded by a spherically symmetric electron cloud, as shown in Fig."
19966,4–11(a).
19967,"As we have described in Chapter 2, the electron is attracted to the center, but the uncertainty principle requires that there be a balance between the concentration in space and in momentum."
19968,The balance means that there must be a certain energy and a certain spread in the electron distribution which determines the characteristic dimension of the hydrogen atom.
19969,"Now suppose that we have a nucleus with two units of charge, such as the helium nucleus."
19970,"This nucleus would attract two electrons, and if they were Bose particles, they would—except for their electric repulsion—both crowd in as close as possible to the nucleus."
19971,A helium atom might look as shown in part (b) of the figure.
19972,"Similarly, a lithium atom which has a triply charged nucleus would have an electron distribution like that shown in part (c) of Fig."
19973,4–11.
19974,"Every atom would look more or less the same—a little round ball with all the electrons sitting near the nucleus, nothing directional and nothing complicated."
19975,"Because electrons are Fermi particles, however, the actual situation is quite different."
19976,For the hydrogen atom the situation is essentially unchanged.
19977,The only difference is that the electron has a spin which we indicate by the little arrow in Fig.
19978,4–12(a).
19979,"In the case of a helium atom, however, we cannot put two electrons on top of each other."
19980,"But wait, that is only true if their spins are the same."
19981,Two electrons can occupy the same state if their spins are opposite.
19982,So the helium atom does not look much different either.
19983,It would appear as shown in part (b) of Fig.
19984,4–12.
19985,"For lithium, however, the situation becomes quite different."
19986,Where can we put the third electron?
19987,The third electron cannot go on top of the other two because both spin directions are occupied.
19988,"The third electron can’t go near the place occupied by the other two, so it must take up a special condition in a different kind of state farther away from the nucleus in part (c) of the figure."
19989,"(We are speaking only in a rather rough way here, because in reality all three electrons are identical; since we cannot really distinguish which one is which, our picture is only an approximate one.)"
19990,Now we can begin to see why different atoms will have different chemical properties.
19991,"Because the third electron in lithium is farther out, it is relatively more loosely bound."
19992,It is much easier to remove an electron from lithium than from helium.
19993,This accounts for the valence of the lithium atom.
19994,"The directional properties of the valence have to do with the pattern of the waves of the outer electron, which we will not go into at the moment."
19995,But we can already see the importance of the so-called exclusion principle—which states that no two electrons can be found in exactly the same state (including spin).
19996,The exclusion principle is also responsible for the stability of matter on a large scale.
19997,We explained earlier that the individual atoms in matter did not collapse because of the uncertainty principle; but this does not explain why it is that two hydrogen atoms can’t be squeezed together as close as you want—why it is that all the protons don’t get close together with one big smear of electrons around them.
19998,"The answer is, of course, that since no more than two electrons—with opposite spins—can be in roughly the same place, the hydrogen atoms must keep away from each other."
19999,So the stability of matter on a large scale is really a consequence of the Fermi particle nature of the electrons.
20000,"Of course, if the outer electrons on two atoms have spins in opposite directions, they can get close to each other."
20001,"This is, in fact, just the way that the chemical bond comes about."
20002,It turns out that two atoms together will generally have the lowest energy if there is an electron between them.
20003,It is a kind of an electrical attraction for the two positive nuclei toward the electron in the middle.
20004,"It is possible to put two electrons more or less between the two nuclei so long as their spins are opposite, and the strongest chemical binding comes about this way."
20005,"There is no stronger binding, because the exclusion principle does not allow there to be more than two electrons in the space between the atoms."
20006,We expect the hydrogen molecule to look more or less as shown in Fig.
20007,4–13.
20008,We want to mention one more consequence of the exclusion principle.
20009,"You remember that if both electrons in the helium atom are to be close to the nucleus, their spins are necessarily opposite."
20010,Now suppose that we would like to try to arrange to have both electrons with the same spin—as we might consider doing by putting on a fantastically strong magnetic field that would try to line up the spins in the same direction.
20011,But then the two electrons could not occupy the same state in space.
20012,"One of them would have to take on a different geometrical position, as indicated in Fig."
20013,4–14.
20014,The electron which is located farther from the nucleus has less binding energy.
20015,The energy of the whole atom is therefore quite a bit higher.
20016,"In other words, when the two spins are opposite, there is a much stronger total attraction."
20017,"So, there is an apparent, enormous force trying to line up spins opposite to each other when two electrons are close together."
20018,"If two electrons are trying to go in the same place, there is a very strong tendency for the spins to become lined opposite."
20019,This apparent force trying to orient the two spins opposite to each other is much more powerful than the tiny force between the two magnetic moments of the electrons.
20020,You remember when we were speaking of ferromagnetism there was the mystery of why the electrons in different atoms had a strong tendency to line up parallel.
20021,"Although there is still no quantitative explanation, it is believed that what happens is that the electrons around the core of one atom interact through the exclusion principle with the outer electrons which have become free to wander throughout the crystal."
20022,This interaction causes the spins of the free electrons and the inner electrons to take on opposite directions.
20023,"But the free electrons and the inner atomic electrons can only be opposite provided all the inner electrons have the same spin direction, as indicated in Fig."
20024,4–15.
20025,It seems probable that it is the effect of the exclusion principle acting indirectly through the free electrons that gives rise to the strong aligning forces responsible for ferromagnetism.
20026,We will mention one further example of the influence of the exclusion principle.
20027,"We have said earlier that the nuclear forces are the same between the neutron and the proton, between the proton and the proton, and between the neutron and the neutron."
20028,"Why is it then that a proton and a neutron can stick together to make a deuterium nucleus, whereas there is no nucleus with just two protons or with just two neutrons?"
20029,Such nuclei do not exist.
20030,The combination of two protons does not make a bound state.
20031,"The answer is a result of two effects: first, the exclusion principle; and second, the fact that the nuclear forces are somewhat sensitive to the direction of spin."
20032,The force between a neutron and a proton is attractive and somewhat stronger when the spins are parallel than when they are opposite.
20033,"It happens that these forces are just different enough that a deuteron can only be made if the neutron and proton have their spins parallel; when their spins are opposite, the attraction is not quite strong enough to bind them together."
20034,"Since the spins of the neutron and proton are each one-half and are in the same direction, the deuteron has a spin of one."
20035,"We know, however, that two protons are not allowed to sit on top of each other if their spins are parallel."
20036,"The protons could come together with their spins opposite, but then there is not enough binding to make a stable nucleus, because the nuclear force for opposite spins is too weak to bind a pair of nucleons."
20037,The attractive force between neutrons and protons of opposite spins can be seen by scattering experiments.
20038,Similar scattering experiments with two protons with parallel spins show that there is the corresponding attraction.
20039,In this chapter we really begin the quantum mechanics proper—in the sense that we are going to describe a quantum mechanical phenomenon in a completely quantum mechanical way.
20040,We will make no apologies and no attempt to find connections to classical mechanics.
20041,We want to talk about something new in a new language.
20042,"The particular situation which we are going to describe is the behavior of the so-called quantization of the angular momentum, for a particle of spin one."
20043,But we won’t use words like “angular momentum” or other concepts of classical mechanics until later.
20044,"We have chosen this particular example because it is relatively simple, although not the simplest possible example."
20045,It is sufficiently complicated that it can stand as a prototype which can be generalized for the description of all quantum mechanical phenomena.
20046,"Thus, although we are dealing with a particular example, all the laws which we mention are immediately generalizable, and we will give the generalizations so that you will see the general characteristics of a quantum mechanical description."
20047,We begin with the phenomenon of the splitting of a beam of atoms into three separate beams in a Stern-Gerlach experiment.
20048,"You remember that if we have an inhomogeneous magnetic field made by a magnet with a pointed pole tip and we send a beam through the apparatus, the beam of particles may be split into a number of beams—the number depending on the particular kind of atom and its state."
20049,"We are going to take the case of an atom which gives three beams, and we are going to call that a particle of spin one."
20050,"You can do for yourself the case of five beams, seven beams, two beams, etc.—you just copy everything down and where we have three terms, you will have five terms, seven terms, and so on."
20051,Imagine the apparatus drawn schematically in Fig.
20052,5–1.
20053,A beam of atoms (or particles of any kind) is collimated by some slits and passes through a nonuniform field.
20054,"Then, looking from the side, we will see the beam split vertically into three beams, as shown in the figure."
20055,Now at the output end of the magnet we could put small counters which count the rate of arrival of particles in any one of the three beams.
20056,Or we can block off two of the beams and let the third one go on.
20057,"Suppose we block off the lower two beams and let the top-most beam go on and enter a second Stern-Gerlach apparatus of the same kind, as shown in Fig."
20058,5–2.
20059,What happens?
20060,There are not three beams in the second apparatus; there is only the top beam.1 This is what you would expect if you think of the second apparatus as simply an extension of the first.
20061,Those atoms which are being pushed upward continue to be pushed upward in the second magnet.
20062,You can see then that the first apparatus has produced a beam of “purified” objects—atoms that get bent upward in the particular inhomogeneous field.
20063,"The atoms, as they enter the original Stern-Gerlach apparatus, are of three “varieties,” and the three kinds take different trajectories."
20064,"By filtering out all but one of the varieties, we can make a beam whose future behavior in the same kind of apparatus is determined and predictable."
20065,"We will call this a filtered beam, or a polarized beam, or a beam in which the atoms all are known to be in a definite state."
20066,"For the rest of our discussion, it will be more convenient if we consider a somewhat modified apparatus of the Stern-Gerlach type."
20067,"The apparatus looks more complicated at first, but it will make all the arguments simpler."
20068,"Anyway, since they are only “thought experiments,” it doesn’t cost anything to complicate the equipment."
20069,"(Incidentally, no one has ever done all of the experiments we will describe in just this way, but we know what would happen from the laws of quantum mechanics, which are, of course, based on other similar experiments."
20070,"These other experiments are harder to understand at the beginning, so we want to describe some idealized—but possible—experiments.)"
20071,Figure 5–3(a) shows a drawing of the “modified Stern-Gerlach apparatus” we would like to use.
20072,It consists of a sequence of three high-gradient magnets.
20073,The first one (on the left) is just the usual Stern-Gerlach magnet and splits the incoming beam of spin-one particles into three separate beams.
20074,"The second magnet pushes in the opposite direction on the atomic magnets and bends their paths back toward the axis, as shown in the trajectories drawn in the lower part of the figure."
20075,"The third magnet is just like the first, and brings the three beams back together again, so that leaves the exit hole along the axis."
20076,"That is not essential, but it will mean that in our analysis we won’t have to worry about including any effects of the motion as the atoms come out, and can concentrate on those matters having only to do with the spin."
20077,"The whole purpose of the “improved” apparatus is just to bring all the particles to the same place, and with zero speed."
20078,Now if we want to do an experiment like the one in Fig.
20079,"5–2, we can first make a filtered beam by putting a plate in the middle of the apparatus that blocks two of the beams, as shown in Fig."
20080,5–4.
20081,"(We are going to consider all sorts of combinations, and we will need labels to keep things straight.)"
20082,Now in Fig.
20083,"5–4 the second apparatus is oriented just like the first, so the filtered atoms will all go on the upper path."
20084,"Or if we had blocked off the upper and lower beams in the first apparatus and let only the zero state through, all the filtered atoms would go through the middle path of the second apparatus."
20085,"And if we had blocked off all but the lowest beam in the first, there would be only a low beam in the second."
20086,We can make our second apparatus so that it transmits only atoms of a particular state—by putting masks inside it as we did for the first one—and then we can test the state of the incoming beam just by seeing whether anything comes out the far end.
20087,"To make this kind of discussion easier, we are going to invent a shorthand symbol to represent one of our improved Stern-Gerlach apparatuses."
20088,(This is not a symbol you will ever find used in quantum mechanics; we’ve just invented it for this chapter.
20089,It is simply meant to be a shorthand picture of the apparatus of Fig.
20090,5–3.)
20091,"Since we are going to want to use several apparatuses at once, and with various orientations, we will identify each with a letter underneath."
20092,5–5.
20093,If we have two filters in succession (as in Fig.
20094,Now we want to describe these experiments quantum mechanically.
20095,"Now comes the big question: What happens if the second apparatus is tipped to a different angle, so that its field axis is no longer parallel to the first?"
20096,5–6.
20097,"In other words, as careful as we have been to make sure that we have the atoms in a definite condition, the fact of the matter is that if it goes through an apparatus which is tilted at a different angle it has, so to speak, to “reorient” itself—which it does, don’t forget, by luck."
20098,"We can put only one particle through at a time, and then we can only ask the question: What is the probability that it gets through?"
20099,"These odds can be calculated by the absolute squares of complex amplitudes; what we want is some mathematical method, or quantum mechanical description, for these amplitudes."
20100,We can already figure out some relations among these amplitudes.
20101,"But they are all we can easily get, so we’ll go on to some other general questions."
20102,They do not.
20103,There are any number of possibilities each as good as any other.
20104,We should be careful to say that we are considering good filters which do indeed produce “pure” beams.
20105,"If, for instance, our Stern-Gerlach apparatus didn’t produce a good separation of the three beams so that we could not separate them cleanly by our masks, then we could not make a complete separation into base states."
20106,We can tell if we have pure base states by seeing whether or not the beams can be split again in another filter of the same kind.
20107,We must also point out that what we are saying is exactly true only in rather idealized situations.
20108,"In any real Stern-Gerlach apparatus, we would have to worry about diffraction by the slits that could cause some atoms to go into states corresponding to different angles, or about whether the beams might contain atoms with different excitations of their internal states, and so on."
20109,"We have idealized the situation so that we are talking only about the states that are split in a magnetic field; we are ignoring things having to do with position, momentum, internal excitations, and the like."
20110,"In general, one would need to consider also base states which are sorted out with respect to such things also."
20111,"But to keep the concepts simple, we are considering only our set of three states, which is sufficient for the exact treatment of the idealized situation in which the atoms don’t get torn up in going through the apparatus, or otherwise badly treated, and come to rest when they leave the apparatus."
20112,"You will note that we always begin our thought experiments by taking a filter with only one channel open, so that we start with some definite base state."
20113,We do this because atoms come out of a furnace in various states determined at random by the accidental happenings inside the furnace.
20114,(It gives what is called an “unpolarized” beam.)
20115,This randomness involves probabilities of the “classical” kind—as in coin tossing—which are different from the quantum mechanical probabilities we are worrying about now.
20116,Dealing with an unpolarized beam would get us into additional complications that are better to avoid until after we understand the behavior of polarized beams.
20117,So don’t try to consider at this point what happens if the first apparatus lets more than one beam through.
20118,(We will tell you how you can handle such cases at the end of the chapter.)
20119,Let’s now go back and see what happens when we go from a base state for one filter to a base state for a different filter.
20120,But that is not true.
20121,"The past information is not lost by the separation into three beams, but by the blocking masks that are put in—as we can see by the following set of experiments."
20122,This is one of the great laws of quantum mechanics.
20123,"That nature works this way is not self-evident, but the results we have given correspond for our idealized situation to the quantum mechanical behavior observed in innumerable experiments."
20124,How can it be that in going from (5.15) to (5.17)—by opening more channels—we let fewer atoms through?
20125,"This is the old, deep mystery of quantum mechanics—the interference of amplitudes."
20126,It’s the same kind of thing we first saw in the two-slit interference experiment with electrons.
20127,We saw that we could get fewer electrons at some places with both slits open than we got with one slit open.
20128,It works quantitatively this way.
20129,"However, in the setup of (5.16), the answer is different."
20130,In the experiment (5.16) the beam has been split and recombined.
20131,Humpty Dumpty has been put back together again.
20132,We should make one additional condition.
20133,"The wide-open filter must not only transmit all three beams, but it must also not produce unequal disturbances on the three beams."
20134,"For instance, it should not have a strong electric field near one beam and not the others."
20135,"The reason is that even if this extra disturbance would still let all the atoms through the filter, it could change the phases of some of the amplitudes."
20136,"Then the interference would be changed, and the amplitudes in Eqs."
20137,(5.18) and (5.19) would be different.
20138,We will always assume that there are no such extra disturbances.
20139,Let’s rewrite Eqs.
20140,(5.18) and (5.19) in an improved notation.
20141,"Furthermore, the arguments would be the same no matter what states they selected."
20142,Then we can state our fundamental law of Eq.
20143,We want to emphasize again what we mean by base states.
20144,They are like the three states which can be selected by one of our Stern-Gerlach apparatuses.
20145,"One condition is that if you have a base state, then the future is independent of the past."
20146,"Another condition is that if you have a complete set of base states, Eq."
20147,"There is, however, no unique set of base states."
20148,Another condition on a set of base states in any particular representation is that they are all completely different.
20149,Equation (5.25) is not independent of the other laws we have mentioned.
20150,It happens that we are not particularly interested in the mathematical problem of finding the minimum set of independent axioms that will give all the laws as consequences.7 We are satisfied if we have a set that is complete and not apparently inconsistent.
20151,"We can, however, show that Eqs."
20152,(5.25) and (5.24) are not independent.
20153,We can see that there must be another relation among the amplitudes if both Eqs.
20154,(5.10) and (5.24) are true.
20155,"Before going on, we want to summarize the three important general laws about amplitudes."
20156,They are Eqs.
20157,These laws say nothing about what we should choose for a base for our set of base states.
20158,One of the great games of quantum mechanics is to make use of the fact that things can be calculated in more than one way.
20159,We want to show you why these laws are useful.
20160,"Suppose we have an atom in a given condition (by which we mean that it was prepared in a certain way), and we want to know what will happen to it in some experiment."
20161,This is an important idea.
20162,Let’s consider another illustration.
20163,(It’s nice to do thought experiments—you don’t have to go to all the trouble of actually building the apparatus!)
20164,We can do it in the following way.
20165,But they do suggest how we can analyze the problem.
20166,Now notice that the right-hand side of Eq.
20167,(5.32) is really “simpler” than the left-hand side.
20168,The result of an experiment is predicted using Eq.
20169,(5.32).
20170,This then is the machinery of quantum mechanics for a spin-one particle.
20171,Every state is described by three numbers which are the amplitudes to be in each of some selected set of base states.
20172,Every apparatus is described by nine numbers which are the amplitudes to go from one base state to another in the apparatus.
20173,From these numbers anything can be calculated.
20174,The mathematics of quantum mechanics is just an extension of this idea.
20175,We will give you a simple illustration.
20176,Our problem is then solved.
20177,"Thus, we can say that the matrix for a succession of two pieces of apparatus is the matrix product of the matrices for the two apparatuses (putting the first apparatus on the right in the product)."
20178,Anyone who knows matrix algebra then understands that we mean just Eq.
20179,(5.36).
20180,We want to make one final point about the base states used in the calculations.
20181,How can we compare our work with his?
20182,"The final answers for the result of any measurement should come out the same, but in the calculations the various amplitudes and matrices used will be different."
20183,How are they related?
20184,We can do it with the general rule II in (5.27).
20185,This matrix can then be used to convert all of our equations to his form.
20186,It tells us how to transform from one set of base states to another.
20187,"For the case of spin-one particles for which we have only three base states (for higher spins, there are more) the mathematical situation is analogous to what we have seen in vector algebra."
20188,"That is, every vector can be resolved into three “base” vectors which are vectors along the three axes."
20189,He will be using different numbers to represent any particular vector.
20190,"His calculations will look different, but the final results will be the same."
20191,We have considered this before and know the rules for transforming vectors from one set of axes to another.
20192,(We will show you in a later chapter how to derive these same results.)
20193,5–6).
20194,For a spin-one particle only—because it requires three amplitudes—the correspondence with a vector is very close.
20195,"In each case, there are three numbers that must transform with coordinate changes in a certain definite way."
20196,"In fact, there is a set of base states which transform just like the three components of a vector."
20197,[You can check that this is so by using the transformation laws (5.38) and (5.39).]
20198,Now you see why a spin-one particle is often called a “vector particle.”
20199,We began by pointing out that our discussion of spin-one particles would be a prototype for any quantum mechanical problem.
20200,The generalization has only to do with the numbers of states.
20201,"Any phenomenon can be analyzed by giving the amplitudes that it starts in each one of the base states and ends in any other one of the base states, and then summing over the complete set of base states."
20202,We will have more to say later about such transformations.
20203,"It is perhaps best if you don’t worry about this problem just yet, but instead concentrate on problems that always start out with pure states."
20204,"But if you insist, here is how the problem can be handled."
20205,"First, you have to be able to make some reasonable guess about the way the states are distributed in the atoms that come from the furnace."
20206,"The answer is, surprisingly, the same no matter what we choose for our initial resolution—so long as we are dealing with completely random orientations."
20207,(We leave it for you to prove.)
20208,"It is simply that you do not know what the initial state is; you have to think in terms of the probability that the system starts out in the various possible initial states, and then you have to take a weighted average over the various possibilities."
20209,"In the last chapter, using a system of spin one as an example, we outlined the general principles of quantum mechanics:"
20210,We also discussed a little bit about the fact that there can be more than one base for the states and that we can use Eq.
20211,(6.1) to convert from one base to another.
20212,"In the general formula, Eq."
20213,It has the same form as the transformation of a vector from one coordinate system to another.
20214,"In order to avoid being too abstract for too long, we have given you some examples of these coefficients for the spin-one case, so you can see how to use them in practice."
20215,"On the other hand, there is a very beautiful thing in quantum mechanics—that from the sheer fact that there are three states and from the symmetry properties of space under rotations, these coefficients can be found purely by abstract reasoning."
20216,"Showing you such arguments at this early stage has a disadvantage in that you are immersed in another set of abstractions before we get “down to earth.” However, the thing is so beautiful that we are going to do it anyway."
20217,We will show you in this chapter how the transformation coefficients can be derived for spin one-half particles.
20218,"We pick this case, rather than spin one, because it is somewhat easier."
20219,We are going to derive all the coefficients for the transformation from one representation to another by pure reasoning—plus a few assumptions.
20220,Some assumptions are always necessary in order to use “pure” reasoning!
20221,"Although the arguments will be abstract and somewhat involved, the result we get will be relatively simple to state and easy to understand—and the result is the most important thing."
20222,"You may, if you wish, consider this as a sort of cultural excursion."
20223,"We have, in fact, arranged that all the essential results derived here are also derived in some other way when they are needed in later chapters."
20224,"So you need have no fear of losing the thread of our study of quantum mechanics if you omit this chapter entirely, or study it at some later time."
20225,"The excursion is “cultural” in the sense that it is intended to show that the principles of quantum mechanics are not only interesting, but are so deep that by adding only a few extra hypotheses about the structure of space, we can deduce a great many properties of physical systems."
20226,"Also, it is important that we know where the different consequences of quantum mechanics come from, because so long as our laws of physics are incomplete—as we know they are—it is interesting to find out whether the places where our theories fail to agree with experiment is where our logic is the best or where our logic is the worst."
20227,"Until now, it appears that where our logic is the most abstract it always gives correct results—it agrees with experiment."
20228,Only when we try to make specific models of the internal machinery of the fundamental particles and their interactions are we unable to find a theory that agrees with experiment.
20229,"The theory then that we are about to describe agrees with experiment wherever it has been tested—for the strange particles as well as for electrons, protons, and so on."
20230,"So, it is always possible to make an arbitrary change in phase of all the amplitudes in any given problem if you want to."
20231,"Or suppose, for instance, that we were computing something with Eq."
20232,"(6.1), but then we suddenly change all of the phases of a certain base system."
20233,So it is a general rule that if we change all the amplitudes with respect to a given base system by the same phase—or even if we just change all the amplitudes in any problem by the same phase—it makes no difference.
20234,"There is, therefore, some freedom to choose the phases in our transformation matrix."
20235,Every now and then we will make such an arbitrary choice—usually following the conventions that are in general use.
20236,We consider again the “improved” Stern-Gerlach apparatus described in the last chapter.
20237,"A beam of spin one-half particles, entering at the left, would, in general, be split into two beams, as shown schematically in Fig."
20238,6-1.
20239,(There were three beams for spin one.)
20240,"As before, the beams are put back together again unless one or the other of them is blocked off by a “stop” which intercepts the beam at its half-way point."
20241,In the figure we show an arrow which points in the direction of the increase of the magnitude of the field—say toward the magnet pole with the sharp edges.
20242,This arrow we take to represent the “up” axis of any particular apparatus.
20243,It is fixed relative to the apparatus and will allow us to indicate the relative orientations when we use several apparatuses together.
20244,We also assume that the direction of the magnetic field in each magnet is always the same with respect to the arrow.
20245,(There is no “zero” state for spin one-half particles.)
20246,"Now suppose we put two of our modified Stern-Gerlach apparatuses in sequence, as shown in Fig."
20247,6-2(a).
20248,We can consider that the first apparatus “prepares” a particular state in one representation and that the second apparatus “analyzes” that state in terms of the second representation.
20249,"In fact, it is almost impossible, but not quite."
20250,"It is so nearly impossible that there is only one way it can be done, and that is the reason we can find out what that unique way is."
20251,The first kind of argument we can make is this.
20252,Suppose we have a setup like the one in Fig.
20253,Now suppose we make another measurement with the apparatus of Fig.
20254,6-2(b).
20255,"We are assuming, in other words, that the result of any experiment of this type is the same—that the physics is the same—no matter how the whole apparatus is oriented in space."
20256,"(You say, “That’s obvious.” But it is an assumption, and it is “right” only if it is actually what happens.)"
20257,6-2(a) and Fig.
20258,For our next step we will need one more piece of information.
20259,6-3(a).
20260,"(It’s beginning to look horrible, but that’s the fun of abstract thinking—you can make the most weird experiments just by drawing lines!)"
20261,We can get the answer by applying Eq.
20262,(6.5) twice in succession.
20263,(6.6) in Eq.
20264,6-3(b).
20265,"Now, clearly, Eqs."
20266,(6.11).
20267,"If you wish, you can find Eq."
20268,(6.11) directly from Eq.
20269," To be thorough, we should add the following parenthetical remarks."
20270,"They are not terribly important, however, so you can skip to the next section if you want."
20271,What we have said is not quite right.
20272,We cannot really say that Eq.
20273,(6.9) and Eq.
20274,(6.10) must give exactly the same amplitudes.
20275,"So, instead of Eq."
20276,"We know that it doesn’t matter if all amplitudes are changed by the same phase, so we could just ignore this phase factor if we wanted to."
20277,(6.12) will always be zero.
20278,"Although it is not important for the rest of our arguments, we can give a quick proof by using a mathematical theorem about determinants."
20279,"[If you don’t yet know much about determinants, don’t worry about the proof and just skip to the definition of Eq."
20280,(6.15).]
20281," First, we should say that Eq."
20282,(6.11) is the mathematical definition of a “product” of two matrices.
20283,Applying this theorem to Eq.
20284,Now let’s take the square root of Eq.
20285,(6.13) and divide it into Eq.
20286,(We won’t prove it; you will see that it always comes out that way.)
20287,It is done like this.
20288,"In what follows, we will always assume that our matrices have been put in the “standard form” ; then we can use Eq."
20289,(6.11) without having any extra phase factors.
20290,"With our rule for compounding rotations and our assumption that space has no preferred direction, we have the keys we need for finding the matrix of any arbitrary rotation."
20291,There is only one solution.
20292,6-4(a).
20293,6-4(b).
20294,And that would be quite right.
20295,6-4.
20296,The two apparatuses in (a) and (b) of Fig.
20297,"6-4 are, in fact, different, as we can see in the following way."
20298,6-5(b).
20299,"(By symmetry, we would now expect only one-half of the particles to get through.)"
20300,What could have changed?
20301,Our original assumption is that it should not.
20302,"6-5—and, therefore, also in Fig."
20303,6-4.
20304,How could it tell?
20305,We have seen that equal phase changes in all amplitudes have no physical consequence.
20306,These phase factors are responsible for the different results in the two experiments of Fig.
20307,6-5.
20308,We already know the answer for one case.
20309,"Thus, when the angle is doubled, the phase is doubled."
20310,We can evidently extend the argument and build up any rotation at all by a sequence of infinitesimal rotations.
20311,This argument is wrong!
20312,"However, this is just the original state all over again."
20313,(It is again a case of a common phase change.)
20314,But we have done nothing to change the original state; the answer is wrong.
20315,"They aren’t really new, though, because the common change of sign doesn’t give any different physics."
20316,(We have defined the coordinate axes in Fig.
20317,6-1.)
20318,6-6.
20319,(6.20)—we should get the result of Eq.
20320,(6.18).
20321,"However, that is the only way they can differ."
20322,6-7(a).
20323,6-7(a).
20324,We can now think of getting to the same orientation by the two successive rotations shown in (b) and (c) of the figure.
20325,6-7(c).
20326,"It is purely a matter of convention, and we adopt the one in general use."
20327,It is not hard to do.
20328,Look at the second and fourth equations.
20329,You may be thinking: “This is getting ridiculous.
20330,How do we get it?
20331,6-8.
20332,It is a property of space.
20333,"(These facts of the combinations of rotations, and what they produce, are hard to grasp intuitively."
20334,"It is rather strange, because we live in three dimensions, but it is hard for us to appreciate what happens if we turn this way and then that way."
20335,"Perhaps, if we were fish or birds and had a real appreciation of what happens when we turn somersaults in space, we could more easily appreciate such things.)"
20336,(6.32).
20337,It is only a little more complicated than the others.
20338,Now we can see how to do any angle at all.
20339,"First, notice that any relative orientation of two coordinate frames can be described in terms of three angles, as shown in Fig."
20340,6-9.
20341,"So just starting from some assumptions about the properties of space, we have derived the amplitude transformation for any rotation at all."
20342,The four coefficients in Eqs.
20343,(6.35) are the terms of the “transformation matrix” with which we can project the amplitudes of a spin one-half particle into any other coordinate system.
20344,We will now work out a few examples to show you how it all works.
20345,Let’s take the following simple question.
20346,"For this problem, then, it is simplest to use Eqs."
20347,"(6.32)—although you could, of course, use the complete equations of (6.35)."
20348,6-10.
20349,"We would like, finally, to summarize the results of this chapter in a form that will be useful for our later work."
20350,"First, we remind you that our primary result in Eqs."
20351,(6.35) can be written in another notation.
20352,Note that Eqs.
20353,(6.35) mean just the same thing as Eq.
20354,(6.4).
20355,"That is, in Eqs."
20356,(6.6).
20357,(We have a plethora of notations!)
20358,"We can, therefore, make a summary of our results in the form of a table, as we have done in Table 6–1."
20359,It will occasionally be handy to have these amplitudes already worked out for some simple special cases.
20360,We want now to talk a little bit about the behavior of probability amplitudes in time.
20361,"We say a “little bit,” because the actual behavior in time necessarily involves the behavior in space as well."
20362,"Thus, we get immediately into the most complicated possible situation if we are to do it correctly and in detail."
20363,"We are always in the difficulty that we can either treat something in a logically rigorous but quite abstract way, or we can do something which is not at all rigorous but which gives us some idea of a real situation—postponing until later a more careful treatment."
20364,"With regard to energy dependence, we are going to take the second course."
20365,We will make a number of statements.
20366,"We will not try to be rigorous—but will just be telling you things that have been found out, to give you some feeling for the behavior of amplitudes as a function of time."
20367,"As we go along, the precision of the description will increase, so don’t get nervous that we seem to be picking things out of the air."
20368,"It is, of course, all out of the air—the air of experiment and of the imagination of people."
20369,"But it would take us too long to go over the historical development, so we have to plunge in somewhere."
20370,We could plunge into the abstract and deduce everything—which you would not understand—or we could go through a large number of experiments to justify each statement.
20371,We choose to do something in between.
20372,"An electron alone in empty space can, under certain circumstances, have a certain definite energy."
20373,"For example, if it is standing still (so it has no translational motion, no momentum, or kinetic energy), it has its rest energy."
20374,"A more complicated object like an atom can also have a definite energy when standing still, but it could also be internally excited to another energy level."
20375,(We will describe later the machinery of this.)
20376,"We can often think of an atom in an excited state as having a definite energy, but this is really only approximately true."
20377,An atom doesn’t stay excited forever because it manages to discharge its energy by its interaction with the electromagnetic field.
20378,"So there is some amplitude that a new state is generated—with the atom in a lower state, and the electromagnetic field in a higher state, of excitation."
20379,"The total energy of the system is the same before and after, but the energy of the atom is reduced."
20380,So it is not precise to say an excited atom has a definite energy; but it will often be convenient and not too wrong to say that it does.
20381,"[Incidentally, why does it go one way instead of the other way?"
20382,Why does an atom radiate light?
20383,The answer has to do with entropy.
20384,"When the energy is in the electromagnetic field, there are so many different ways it can be—so many different places where it can wander—that if we look for the equilibrium condition, we find that in the most probable situation the field is excited with a photon, and the atom is de-excited."
20385,It takes a very long time for the photon to come back and find that it can knock the atom back up again.
20386,It’s quite analogous to the classical problem: Why does an accelerating charge radiate?
20387,"It isn’t that it “wants” to lose energy, because, in fact, when it radiates, the energy of the world is the same as it was before."
20388,Radiation or absorption goes in the direction of increasing entropy.]
20389,"Nuclei can also exist in different energy levels, and in an approximation which disregards the electromagnetic effects, we can say that a nucleus in an excited state stays there."
20390,"Although we know that it doesn’t stay there forever, it is often useful to start out with an approximation which is somewhat idealized and easier to think about."
20391,Also it is often a legitimate approximation under certain circumstances.
20392,"(When we first introduced the classical laws of a falling body, we did not include friction, but there is almost never a case in which there isn’t some friction.)"
20393,"Then there are the subnuclear “strange particles,” which have various masses."
20394,"But the heavier ones disintegrate into other light particles, so again it is not correct to say that they have a precisely definite energy."
20395,That would be true only if they lasted forever.
20396,"So when we make the approximation that they have a definite energy, we are forgetting the fact that they must blow up."
20397,"For the moment, then, we will intentionally forget about such processes and learn later how to take them into account."
20398,This mass includes any internal energy; so an excited atom has a mass which is different from the mass of the same atom in the ground state.
20399,(The ground state means the state of lowest energy.)
20400,"For an atom at rest, the quantum mechanical amplitude to find an atom at a place is the same everywhere; it does not depend on position."
20401,"This means, of course, that the probability of finding the atom anywhere is the same."
20402,But it means even more.
20403,"The probability could be independent of position, and still the phase of the amplitude could vary from point to point."
20404,"But for a particle at rest, the complete amplitude is identical everywhere."
20405,"It does, however, depend on the time."
20406,"The amplitude to be at any point in space is the same for all points, but depends on time according to (7.1)."
20407,We shall simply assume this rule to be true.
20408,"There are three different ways of specifying the energy: by the frequency of an amplitude, by the energy in the classical sense, or by the inertia."
20409,They are all equivalent; they are just different ways of saying the same thing.
20410,You may be thinking that it is strange to think of a “particle” which has equal amplitudes to be found throughout all space.
20411,"After all, we usually imagine a “particle” as a small object located “somewhere.”  But don’t forget the uncertainty principle."
20412,"If a particle has a definite energy, it has also a definite momentum."
20413,"If the internal parts of an atom are in a different state with a different total energy, then the variation of the amplitude with time is different."
20414,"If you don’t know in which state it is, there will be a certain amplitude to be in one state and a certain amplitude to be in another—and each of these amplitudes will have a different frequency."
20415,There will be an interference between these different components—like a beat-note—which can show up as a varying probability.
20416,Something will be “going on” inside of the atom—even though it is “at rest” in the sense that its center of mass is not drifting.
20417,"However, if the atom has one definite energy, the amplitude is given by (7.1), and the absolute square of this amplitude does not depend on time."
20418,"You see, then, that if a thing has a definite energy and if you ask any probability question about it, the answer is independent of time."
20419,"Although the amplitudes vary with time, if the energy is definite they vary as an imaginary exponential, and the absolute value doesn’t change."
20420,That’s why we often say that an atom in a definite energy level is in a stationary state.
20421,"If you make any measurements of the things inside, you’ll find that nothing (in probability) will change in time."
20422,"In order to have the probabilities change in time, we have to have the interference of two amplitudes at two different frequencies, and that means that we cannot know what the energy is."
20423,The object will have one amplitude to be in a state of one energy and another amplitude to be in a state of another energy.
20424,That’s the quantum mechanical description of something when its behavior depends on time.
20425,"If we have a “condition” which is a mixture of two different states with different energies, then the amplitude for each of the two states varies with time according to Eq."
20426,"But notice that if we added a constant to both energies, it wouldn’t make any difference."
20427,"When we take the absolute squares to find the probabilities, all the answers would be the same."
20428,The choice of an origin for our energy scale makes no difference; we can measure energy from any zero we want.
20429,"For relativistic purposes it is nice to measure the energy so that the rest mass is included, but for many purposes that aren’t relativistic it is often nice to subtract some standard amount from all energies that appear."
20430,"So, sometimes we may shift our zero of energy by some very large constant, but it doesn’t make any difference, provided we shift all the energies in a particular calculation by the same constant."
20431,So much for a particle standing still.
20432,"If we suppose that the relativity theory is right, a particle at rest in one inertial system can be in uniform motion in another inertial system."
20433,7–1.
20434,7–1.
20435,"(See Chapter 17, Vol."
20436,"I, Fig."
20437,Note that our relativistic transformation has given us the variation of the amplitude of an atom which moves in space without any additional assumptions.
20438,This formula was first arrived at by de Broglie in just this way.
20439,(It is important to notice that the amplitude is a complex wave.
20440,"If we used a real sine wave, the square would vary from point to point, which would not be right.)"
20441,"We know, of course, that there are situations in which particles move from place to place so that the probability depends on position and changes with time."
20442,How do we describe such situations?
20443,We can do that by considering amplitudes which are a superposition of two or more amplitudes for states of definite energy.
20444,We have already discussed this situation in Chapter 48 of Vol.
20445,I—even for probability amplitudes!
20446,"Alternatively, if we use the nonrelativistic expressions Eqs."
20447,"Our result, then, is that if we have several amplitudes for pure energy states of nearly the same energy, their interference gives “lumps” in the probability that move through space with a velocity equal to the velocity of a classical particle of that energy."
20448,"We should remark, however, that when we say we can add two amplitudes of different wave number together to get a beat-note that will correspond to a moving particle, we have introduced something new—something that we cannot deduce from the theory of relativity."
20449,We said what the amplitude did for a particle standing still and then deduced what it would do if the particle were moving.
20450,But we cannot deduce from these arguments what would happen when there are two waves moving with different speeds.
20451,"If we stop one, we cannot stop the other."
20452,Now we would like to discuss what happens when the energy of a particle can change.
20453,We begin by thinking of a particle which moves in a force field described by a potential.
20454,We discuss first the effect of a constant potential.
20455,7–2.
20456,"Then there can be no change in the physics inside, because the constant potential doesn’t make any difference so far as anything going on inside the can is concerned."
20457,"Now there is no way we can deduce what the answer should be, so we must make a guess."
20458,Now what about physical phenomena inside the box?
20459,"If there are several different energy states, what will we get?"
20460,That is just like a change in the zero of our energy scale.
20461,"It produces an equal phase change in all amplitudes, but as we have seen before, this doesn’t change any of the probabilities."
20462,All the physical phenomena are the same.
20463,"If an object could change its charge in going from one state to another, we would have quite another result, but conservation of charge prevents this.)"
20464,"So far, our assumption agrees with what we would expect for a change of energy reference level."
20465,"But if it is really right, it should hold for a potential energy that is not just a constant."
20466,"We don’t want to get concerned with the general case right now, but only want to get some idea about how some things happen, so we will think only of a potential that is constant in time and varies very slowly in space."
20467,Then we can make a comparison between the classical and quantum ideas.
20468,Suppose we think of the situation in Fig.
20469,We imagine that some particle has an amplitude to be found in any one of the regions.
20470,"We also assume that the momentum is large enough so that in any small region in which there are many wavelengths, the potential is nearly constant."
20471,"Classically, it would be going faster in the second box—it would have more energy and, therefore, more momentum."
20472,Let’s see how that might come out of quantum mechanics.
20473,The question is: How do these two amplitudes match together through the region between the boxes?
20474,We are going to suppose that the potentials are all constant in time—so that nothing in the conditions varies.
20475,"We will then suppose that the variations of the amplitude (that is, its phase) have the same frequency everywhere—because, so to speak, there is nothing in the “medium” that depends on time."
20476,"If nothing in the space is changing, we can consider that the wave in one region “generates” subsidiary waves all over space which will all oscillate at the same frequency—just as light waves going through materials at rest do not change their frequency."
20477,(7.23) is a statement of the conservation of energy.
20478,"In other words, the classical statement of the conservation of energy is equivalent to the quantum mechanical statement that the frequencies for a particle are everywhere the same if the conditions are not changing with time."
20479,The surfaces of equal phase are shown by the dashed lines in Fig.
20480,7–3.
20481,(7.23).
20482,"Quantum mechanically, however, the amplitude is still given by Eq."
20483,7–4(a).
20484,"If we plot the real part of the probability amplitude, we get the dependence shown in part (b) of the figure."
20485,"The wave in the first region corresponds to a particle trying to get into the second region, but the amplitude there falls off rapidly."
20486,There is some chance that it will be observed in the second region—where it could never get classically—but the amplitude is very small except right near the boundary.
20487,The situation is very much like what we found for the total internal reflection of light.
20488,"The light doesn’t normally get out, but we can observe it if we put something within a wavelength or two of the surface."
20489,"You will remember that if we put a second surface close to the boundary where light was totally reflected, we could get some light transmitted into the second piece of material."
20490,The corresponding thing happens to particles in quantum mechanics.
20491,"But quantum mechanically, the exponentially decaying amplitude can reach across the region and give a small probability that the particle will be found on the other side where the kinetic energy is again positive."
20492,The situation is illustrated in Fig.
20493,7–5.
20494,This effect is called the quantum mechanical “penetration of a barrier.”
20495,7–6(a).
20496,"Closer in, however, the potential energy is much lower because of the strong attraction of the short-range nuclear forces."
20497,The probability amplitude is roughly as sketched in part (b) of Fig.
20498,"7–6, although actually the exponential decay is much larger than shown."
20499,Suppose that we have a particle moving along and passing through a region where there is a potential that varies at right angles to the motion.
20500,"Classically, we would describe the situation as sketched in Fig."
20501,7–7.
20502,It is now up to us to see if our idea that the waves go as (7.20) will explain the same result.
20503,"We look at the same thing quantum mechanically, assuming that everything is on a very large scale compared with a wavelength of our probability amplitudes."
20504,We have sketched in Fig.
20505,7–8 what the waves of probability amplitude will look like.
20506,We have drawn a set of “wave nodes” which you can think of as surfaces where the phase of the amplitude is zero.
20507,So the angle of the wave nodes gets changed as shown in the figure.
20508,The result we have just got is correct only if the potential variations are slow and smooth—in what we call the classical limit.
20509,"In the classical limit, the quantum mechanics will agree with Newtonian mechanics."
20510,Notice that we have not assumed anything special about the potential energy—it is just that energy whose derivative gives a force.
20511,"If we wanted to give a quantum mechanical description, we would have said that the particles in one beam had an energy that varied one way and that those in the other beam had an opposite energy variation."
20512,"Because of the energy variation, the waves are refracted, and the beams are bent up or down."
20513,(We see now that quantum mechanics would give us the same bending as we would compute from the classical mechanics.)
20514,This result has some interesting consequences.
20515,Suppose we have a spin one-half particle in some state that is not purely spin up or spin down.
20516,We can describe its condition in terms of the amplitudes to be in the pure up and pure down states.
20517,"But in a magnetic field, these two states will have phases changing at a different rate."
20518,"So if we ask some question about the amplitudes, the answer will depend on how long it has been in the field."
20519,"As an example, we consider the disintegration of the muon in a magnetic field."
20520,Suppose then that we consider the experimental arrangement shown in Fig.
20521,7–9.
20522,"The electrons emitted will, in general, go off in all possible directions."
20523,Without a magnetic field there would be some angular distribution of decay directions; we would like to know how this distribution is changed by the presence of the magnetic field.
20524,We expect that it may vary in some way with time.
20525,"Now we do not have any rule for the behavior of a spin one-half particle in a magnetic field at right angles to the spin, but we do know what happens to the spin up and spin down states with respect to the field—their amplitudes get multiplied by the factor (7.34)."
20526,Any question can then be expressed with reference to the amplitudes for these states.
20527,Now we know what happens to these two amplitudes with time.
20528,"Our general rules can, however, take care of this problem."
20529,(7.37).
20530,7–10.
20531,"Thus, we find that the chance of catching the decay electron in the electron counter of Fig."
20532,7–9 varies periodically with the length of time the muon has been sitting in the magnetic field.
20533,"The magnetic moment of the muon has, in fact, been measured in just this way."
20534,"We can, of course, use the same method to answer any other questions about the muon decay."
20535,You can begin to see the form that our quantum mechanical description will take when we are describing how things behave in time.
20536,"Before we begin the main topic of this chapter, we would like to describe a number of mathematical ideas that are used a lot in the literature of quantum mechanics."
20537,Knowing them will make it easier for you to read other books or papers on the subject.
20538,The first idea is the close mathematical resemblance between the equations of quantum mechanics and those of the scalar product of two vectors.
20539,Equation (8.1) is a mathematical law that is just as true whether we put the filtering equipment in or not—it is not always necessary to imagine that the apparatus is there.
20540,We would like to compare Eq.
20541,So Eq.
20542,Comparing Eqs.
20543,"Furthermore, if you know the coefficients of each “base vector” in this combination—that is, its three components—you know everything about a vector."
20544,"Because of this close analogy, what we have called a “state” is often also called a “state vector.”"
20545,There is one minor difference between Eq.
20546,(8.1) and the dot product.
20547,(8.6) involves a quantity which is different from a dot product.
20548,"A dot product is just a number, whereas Eq."
20549,(8.6) is a vector equation.
20550,One of the great tricks of vector analysis was to abstract away from the equations the idea of a vector itself.
20551,One might be similarly inclined to abstract a thing that is the analog of a “vector” from the quantum mechanical formula Eq.
20552,(8.1)—and one can indeed.
20553,"In any case, they are not numbers, and, in general, we want the results of our calculations to come out as numbers; so such “unfinished” quantities are only part-way steps in our calculations."
20554,It happens that until now we have written all our results in terms of numbers.
20555,How have we managed to avoid vectors?
20556,It is amusing to note that even in ordinary vector algebra we could make all equations involve only numbers.
20557,Now look at Eq.
20558,(8.1).
20559,(8.8) instead.
20560,So Eq.
20561,(8.8) means exactly the same thing as Eq.
20562,"(8.1)—no more, no less."
20563,(8.8).
20564,(There is no analog in vector analysis.)
20565,(8.1).
20566,"It is not really very useful, but it’s a nice reminder that the equation is true for any two states."
20567,Let’s look at Eq.
20568,(8.8) again; we can think of it in the following way.
20569,(8.1).
20570,(8.13) and Eq.
20571,"When we do that, we have to be careful of the summation indices, because they are quite distinct in the two equations."
20572,Let’s first rewrite Eq.
20573,Then putting it together with Eq.
20574,So Eq.
20575,(8.15).
20576,"This equation is, of course, just Eq."
20577,(8.1) written with different symbols.
20578,So we have just gone in a circle to get used to the new symbols.
20579,"Depending on the situation, two, or three, or five, or an infinite number of base states may be involved."
20580,We have also talked about what happens when particles go through an apparatus.
20581,"(It is closer to tensor algebra, but the analogy is not particularly useful.)"
20582,"We saw in Chapter 5, Eq."
20583,"(8.9), used twice."
20584,"Incidentally, we can think of Eq."
20585,(8.17) in another way.
20586,The answer is yes.
20587,We want Eq.
20588,"In fact, we can play with our notation and write the last term of Eq."
20589,One final example of the tricks of the trade.
20590,We start again with Eq.
20591,(8.17).
20592,"As it stands, it is an “open” equation and incomplete."
20593,(8.22) all over again.
20594,It is something which “operates on” a state to produce a new state—Eq.
20595,We have really added nothing new with all of this new mathematical notation.
20596,"One reason for bringing it all up was to show you the way of writing pieces of equations, because in many books you will find the equations written in the incomplete forms, and there’s no reason for you to be paralyzed when you come across them."
20597,"If you prefer, you can always add the missing pieces to make an equation between numbers that will look like something more familiar."
20598,"Also, as you will see, the “bra” and “ket” notation is a very convenient one."
20599,"For one thing, we can from now on identify a state by giving its state vector."
20600,We have discovered that any state in the world can be represented as a superposition—a linear combination with suitable coefficients—of base states.
20601,"You may ask, first of all, what base states?"
20602,"Well, there are many different possibilities."
20603,"There are many, many different representations, which are the analogs of the different coordinate systems one can use to represent ordinary vectors."
20604,"Next, what coefficients?"
20605,"Well, that depends on the physical circumstances."
20606,Different sets of coefficients correspond to different physical conditions.
20607,"The important thing to know about is the “space” in which you are working—in other words, what the base states mean physically."
20608,"So the first thing you have to know about, in general, is what the base states are like."
20609,Then you can understand how to describe a situation in terms of these base states.
20610,"We would like to look ahead a little and speak a bit about what the general quantum mechanical description of nature is going to be—in terms of the now current ideas of physics, anyway."
20611,"First, one decides on a particular representation for the base states—different representations are always possible."
20612,Suppose we begin with a situation with one electron.
20613,"We pick a set of base states, each corresponding to one value of the momentum."
20614,What if the electron doesn’t have a definite momentum?
20615,That’s all right; we’re just saying what the base states are.
20616,"If the electron hasn’t got a definite momentum, it has some amplitude to have one momentum and another amplitude to have another momentum, and so on."
20617,"And if it is not necessarily spinning up, it has some amplitude to be spinning up going at this momentum, and some amplitude to be spinning down going at that momentum, and so on."
20618,"The complete description of an electron, so far as we know, requires only that the base states be described by the momentum and the spin."
20619,What any particular electron is doing is described by telling with what amplitude it has an up-spin or a down-spin and one momentum or another—for all possible momenta.
20620,So you can see what is involved in a complete quantum mechanical description of a single electron.
20621,What about systems with more than one electron?
20622,Then the base states get more complicated.
20623,Let’s suppose that we have two electrons.
20624,"We have, first of all, four possible states with respect to spin: both electrons spinning up, the first one down and the second one up, the first one up and the second one down, or both down."
20625,The base states for two electrons require the specification of two momenta and two spin characters.
20626,"With seven electrons, we have to specify seven of each."
20627,"If we have a proton and an electron, we have to specify the spin direction of the proton and its momentum, and the spin direction of the electron and its momentum."
20628,At least that’s approximately true.
20629,We do not really know what the correct representation is for the world.
20630,"It is all very well to start out by supposing that if you specify the spin in the electron and its momentum, and likewise for a proton, you will have the base states; but what about the “guts” of the proton?"
20631,Let’s look at it this way.
20632,"In a hydrogen atom which has one proton and one electron, we have many different base states to describe—up and down spins of the proton and electron and the various possible momenta of the proton and electron."
20633,"But suppose we look at the whole hydrogen atom as a “particle.” If we didn’t know that the hydrogen atom was made out of a proton and an electron, we might have started out and said: “Oh, I know what the base states are—they correspond to a particular momentum of the hydrogen atom.” No, because the hydrogen atom has internal parts."
20634,"It may, therefore, have various states of different internal energy, and describing the real nature requires more detail."
20635,The question is: Does a proton have internal parts?
20636,"Do we have to describe a proton by giving all possible states of protons, and mesons, and strange particles?"
20637,We don’t know.
20638,"And even though we suppose that the electron is simple, so that all we have to tell about it is its momentum and its spin, maybe tomorrow we will discover that the electron also has inner gears and wheels."
20639,"It would mean that our representation is incomplete, or wrong, or approximate—in the same way that a representation of the hydrogen atom which describes only its momentum would be incomplete, because it disregarded the fact that the hydrogen atom could have become excited inside."
20640,"If an electron could become excited inside and turn into something else like, for instance, a muon, then it would be described not just by giving the states of the new particle, but presumably in terms of some more complicated internal wheels."
20641,The main problem in the study of the fundamental particles today is to discover what are the correct representations for the description of nature.
20642,"At the present time, we guess that for the electron it is enough to specify its momentum and spin."
20643,Several dozen particles—that’s crazy!
20644,The question of what is a fundamental particle and what is not a fundamental particle—a subject you hear so much about these days—is the question of what is the final representation going to look like in the ultimate quantum mechanical description of the world.
20645,Will the electron’s momentum still be the right thing with which to describe nature?
20646,"Or even, should the whole question be put this way at all!"
20647,This question must always come up in any scientific investigation.
20648,"At any rate, we see a problem—how to find a representation."
20649,We don’t know the answer.
20650,"We don’t even know whether we have the “right” problem, but if we do, we must first attempt to find out whether any particular particle is “fundamental” or not."
20651,"In the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics—if the energies are not too high, so that you don’t disturb the inner workings of the strange particles and so forth—you can do a pretty good job without worrying about these details."
20652,You can just decide to specify the momenta and spins of the electrons and of the nuclei; then everything will be all right.
20653,"In most chemical reactions and other low-energy happenings, nothing goes on in the nuclei; they don’t get excited."
20654,"Furthermore, if a hydrogen atom is moving slowly and bumping quietly against other hydrogen atoms—never getting excited inside, or radiating, or anything complicated like that, but staying always in the ground state of energy for internal motion—you can use an approximation in which you talk about the hydrogen atom as one object, or particle, and not worry about the fact that it can do something inside."
20655,"We will often be making an approximation in which we do not include the possibility of inner motion, thereby decreasing the number of details that we have to put into our base states."
20656,"Of course, we then omit some phenomena which would appear (usually) at some higher energy, but by making such approximations we can simplify very much the analysis of physical problems."
20657,"For example, we can discuss the collision of two hydrogen atoms at low energy—or any chemical process—without worrying about the fact that the atomic nuclei could be excited."
20658,One problem then in describing nature is to find a suitable representation for the base states.
20659,But that’s only the beginning.
20660,"We still want to be able to say what “happens.” If we know the “condition” of the world at one moment, we would like to know the condition at a later moment."
20661,So we also have to find the laws that determine how things change with time.
20662,We now address ourselves to this second part of the framework of quantum mechanics—how states change with time.
20663,We have already talked about how we can represent a situation in which we put something through an apparatus.
20664,Perhaps you let it sit in some particular electric or magnetic field—it depends on the physical circumstances in the world.
20665,"During the delay, various things could be going on—external forces applied or other shenanigans—so that something is happening."
20666,"Since “waiting” is just a special case of an “apparatus,” we can describe what happens by giving an amplitude with the same form as Eq."
20667,(8.17).
20668,The high-class theoretical physicist working in high-energy physics considers problems of the following general nature (because it’s the way experiments are usually done).
20669,"He starts with a couple of particles, like a proton and a proton, coming together from infinity."
20670,"(In the lab, usually one particle is standing still, and the other comes from an accelerator that is practically at infinity on atomic level.)"
20671,What’s the amplitude for this to happen?
20672,"For instance, with what amplitude do you get the six mesons going in such-and-such directions, and the two neutrons going off in these directions, with their spins so-and-so."
20673,Then the job of the theorist is to calculate the amplitude (8.27).
20674,"(There is no experimental evidence on the details of the process, only on what comes in and what goes out.)"
20675,"In relativistic quantum mechanics for high energies, it is done one way, but in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics it can be done another way, which is very convenient."
20676,"(This other way can also be done in the relativistic case, but then it is not so convenient.)"
20677,"You can appreciate immediately that this way is not so good for relativity, because you don’t want to have to specify how everything looks “simultaneously” everywhere."
20678,But we won’t worry about that—we’re just going to worry about nonrelativistic mechanics.
20679,We just multiply together all the pieces; that’s the way that quantum mechanics is analyzed nonrelativistically.
20680,Let’s see how we write that out.
20681,"Since we’re not yet too good at these abstract things, let’s project our amplitudes into a definite representation."
20682,If we multiply both sides of Eq.
20683,We can understand Eq.
20684,(8.34) in the following way.
20685,varying with time.
20686,So Eq.
20687,But that is the same as saying that Eq.
20688,Equation (8.39) is then the quantum mechanical law for the dynamics of the world.
20689,(We should say that we will always take a set of base states which are fixed and do not vary with time.
20690,There are people who use base states that also vary.
20691,"However, that’s like using a rotating coordinate system in mechanics, and we don’t want to get involved in such complications.)"
20692,Then we have everything—we can answer any question about what will happen.
20693,And that’s the hardest part.
20694,We do have excellent approximations for nonrelativistic phenomena and for some other special cases.
20695,"In particular, we have the forms that are needed for the motions of electrons in atoms—to describe chemistry."
20696,"(How Hamilton, who worked in the 1830s, got his name on a quantum mechanical matrix is a tale of history.)"
20697,"It would be much better called the energy matrix, for reasons that will become apparent as we work with it."
20698,So the problem is: Know your Hamiltonian!
20699,If you start with a particle—an object or the world—then you’ve still got it as time goes on.
20700,(8.40) must also be true.
20701,Nobody is turning magnets on and off.
20702,"We also pick a system for which only one base state is required for the description; it is an approximation we could make for a hydrogen atom at rest, or something similar."
20703,It is the generalization of the energy for more complex situations.
20704,"Next, to understand a little more about what the equations mean, we look at a system which has two base states."
20705,Then Eq.
20706,"We leave you to try for fun, and we’ll come back and do them later."
20707,We want now to show you how the dynamical equation of quantum mechanics can be used to describe a particular physical circumstance.
20708,"We have picked an interesting but simple example in which, by making some reasonable guesses about the Hamiltonian, we can work out some important—and even practical—results."
20709,We are going to take a situation describable by two states: the ammonia molecule.
20710,"The ammonia molecule has one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms located in a plane below the nitrogen so that the molecule has the form of a pyramid, as drawn in Fig."
20711,8–1(a).
20712,"Now this molecule, like any other, has an infinite number of states."
20713,"It can spin around any possible axis; it can be moving in any direction; it can be vibrating inside, and so on, and so on."
20714,"It is, therefore, not a two-state system at all."
20715,"But we want to make an approximation that all other states remain fixed, because they don’t enter into what we are concerned with at the moment."
20716,"We will consider only that the molecule is spinning around its axis of symmetry (as shown in the figure), that it has zero translational momentum, and that it is vibrating as little as possible."
20717,"That specifies all conditions except one: there are still the two possible positions for the nitrogen atom—the nitrogen may be on one side of the plane of hydrogen atoms or on the other, as shown in Fig."
20718,8–1(a) and (b).
20719,So we will discuss the molecule as though it were a two-state system.
20720,"We mean that there are only two states we are going to really worry about, all other things being assumed to stay put."
20721,"You see, even if we know that it is spinning with a certain angular momentum around the axis and that it is moving with a certain momentum and vibrating in a definite way, there are still two possible states."
20722,"Then, using Eq."
20723,"Now the interesting thing is that if the molecule is known to be in some state at some instant, it will not be in the same state a little while later."
20724,"To find out what this chance is, we have to solve the differential equation which tells us how the amplitudes change with time."
20725,(8.43).
20726,"There are some things we can say, however."
20727,But Eqs.
20728,(8.45) do not tell us what ammonia really does.
20729,It turns out that it is possible for the nitrogen to push its way through the three hydrogens and flip to the other side.
20730,It is quite difficult; to get half-way through requires a lot of energy.
20731,How can it get through if it hasn’t got enough energy?
20732,There is some amplitude that it will penetrate the energy barrier.
20733,It is possible in quantum mechanics to sneak quickly across a region which is illegal energetically.
20734,"Again, by symmetry, they should both be the same—at least in magnitude."
20735,"It turns out, as you will see, that there is no loss of generality if we take them equal to each other."
20736,These equations are simple enough and can be solved in any number of ways.
20737,One convenient way is the following.
20738,We have the solutions; now what do they mean?
20739,(The trouble with quantum mechanics is not only in solving the equations but in understanding what the solutions mean!)
20740,These are the only two states of definite energy.
20741,We will discuss the states of the ammonia molecule in more detail in the next chapter; we will mention here only a couple of things.
20742,"Every one of the possible states of the molecule, whatever energy it has, is “split” into two levels."
20743,"We say every one of the states because, you remember, we picked out one particular state of rotation, and internal energy, and so on."
20744,For each possible condition of that kind there is a doublet of energy levels because of the flip-flop of the molecule.
20745,Let’s now ask the following question about an ammonia molecule.
20746,(8.50) and (8.51).
20747,8–2.
20748,8–2.
20749,The probability sloshes back and forth between the two.
20750,A long time ago we saw what happens when we have two equal pendulums with a slight coupling.
20751,"(See Chapter 49, Vol."
20752,I.)
20753,"When we lift one back and let go, it swings, but then gradually the other one starts to swing."
20754,Pretty soon the second pendulum has picked up all the energy.
20755,"Then, the process reverses, and pendulum number one picks up the energy."
20756,It is exactly the same kind of a thing.
20757,The speed at which the energy is swapped back and forth depends on the coupling between the two pendulums—the rate at which the “oscillation” is able to leak across.
20758,"Also, you remember, with the two pendulums there are two special motions—each with a definite frequency—which we call the fundamental modes."
20759,"If we pull both pendulums out together, they swing together at one frequency."
20760,"On the other hand, if we pull one out one way and the other out the other way, there is another stationary mode also at a definite frequency."
20761,"Well, here we have a similar situation—the ammonia molecule is mathematically like the pair of pendulums."
20762,The pendulum analogy is not much deeper than the principle that the same equations have the same solutions.
20763,The linear equations for the amplitudes (8.39) are very much like the linear equations of harmonic oscillators.
20764,"(In fact, this is the reason behind the success of our classical theory of the index of refraction, in which we replaced the quantum mechanical atom by a harmonic oscillator, even though, classically, this is not a reasonable view of electrons circulating about a nucleus.)"
20765,"If you pull the nitrogen to one side, then you get a superposition of these two frequencies, and you get a kind of beat note, because the system is not in one or the other states of definite frequency."
20766,"The splitting of the energy levels of the ammonia molecule is, however, strictly a quantum mechanical effect."
20767,The splitting of the energy levels of the ammonia molecule has important practical applications which we will describe in the next chapter.
20768,At long last we have an example of a practical physical problem that you can understand with the quantum mechanics!
20769,"In this chapter we are going to discuss the application of quantum mechanics to a practical device, the ammonia maser."
20770,"You may wonder why we stop our formal development of quantum mechanics to do a special problem, but you will find that many of the features of this special problem are quite common in the general theory of quantum mechanics, and you will learn a great deal by considering this one problem in detail."
20771,"The ammonia maser is a device for generating electromagnetic waves, whose operation is based on the properties of the ammonia molecule which we discussed briefly in the last chapter."
20772,We begin by summarizing what we found there.
20773,"The ammonia molecule has many states, but we are considering it as a two-state system, thinking now only about what happens when the molecule is in any specific state of rotation or translation."
20774,A physical model for the two states can be visualized as follows.
20775,"If the ammonia molecule is considered to be rotating about an axis passing through the nitrogen atom and perpendicular to the plane of the hydrogen atoms, as shown in Fig."
20776,"9–1, there are still two possible conditions—the nitrogen may be on one side of the plane of hydrogen atoms or on the other."
20777,They are taken as a set of base states for our analysis of the behavior of the ammonia molecule.
20778,"These two amplitudes change with time according to the Hamiltonian equations, Eq."
20779,(8.43).
20780,We want now to take a closer look at these general solutions.
20781,"We have found two special solutions in which the two amplitudes do not vary in magnitude and, furthermore, have phases which vary at the same frequencies."
20782,"These are stationary states as we defined them in Section 7–1, which means that they are states of definite energy."
20783,"(We mean, of course, two energy levels for the assumed state of rotation and vibration which we referred to in our initial assumptions."
20784,)1
20785,"In order to excite an electron inside an atom, the energies involved are relatively very high—requiring photons in the optical or ultraviolet range."
20786,To excite the vibrations of the molecules involves photons in the infrared.
20787,"If you talk about exciting rotations, the energy differences of the states correspond to photons in the far infrared."
20788,"So here we have a molecule that has a transition which does not emit light in the ordinary sense, but emits microwaves."
20789,For the work that follows we need to describe these two states of definite energy a little bit better.
20790,"We are, however, in a bit of trouble."
20791,"Namely, Eq."
20792,(8.39).
20793,(9.8) and (9.9) look just like what we had in Section 8–6 for the equation of a one-state system.
20794,They have a simple exponential time dependence corresponding to a single energy.
20795,"As time goes on, the amplitudes to be in each state act independently."
20796,(9.8) and (9.9).
20797,"Or, if it is in the upper state, it may change to the lower state and emit a photon."
20798,But in order to induce such transitions you must have a physical connection to the states—some way of disturbing the system.
20799,"There must be some external machinery for affecting the states, such as magnetic or electric fields."
20800,"In this particular case, these states are sensitive to an electric field."
20801,"We will, therefore, look next at the problem of the behavior of the ammonia molecule in an external electric field."
20802,Suppose that there is an electric field in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the hydrogen atoms.
20803,"Disregarding for the moment the possibility of flipping back and forth, would it be true that the energy of this molecule is the same for the two positions of the nitrogen atom?"
20804,"Generally, no."
20805,"The electrons tend to lie closer to the nitrogen than to the hydrogen nuclei, so the hydrogens are slightly positive."
20806,The actual amount depends on the details of electron distribution.
20807,"It is a complicated problem to figure out exactly what this distribution is, but in any case the net result is that the ammonia molecule has an electric dipole moment, as indicated in Fig."
20808,9–1.
20809,We can continue our analysis without knowing in detail the direction or amount of displacement of the charge.
20810,"Now, when the nitrogen flips from one side to the other, the center of mass will not move, but the electric dipole moment will flip over."
20811,"According to the correct physical theory, it should be possible to calculate these constants in terms of the positions and motions of all the nuclei and electrons."
20812,But nobody has ever done it.
20813,Such a system involves ten electrons and four nuclei and that’s just too complicated a problem.
20814,"As a matter of fact, there is no one who knows much more about this molecule than we do."
20815,"All anyone can say is that when there is an electric field, the energy of the two states is different, the difference being proportional to the electric field."
20816,"For the ammonia molecule in an electric field, our description must be changed."
20817,"However, when there are only two equations and two unknowns, we don’t need such a sophisticated idea."
20818,(9.22).
20819,"(9.18) and (9.19), we have the amplitudes for the two stationary states (the states of definite energy)."
20820,"If there are no external disturbances, a system initially in one of these states will stay that way forever—only its phase changes."
20821,We can check our results for two special cases.
20822,"This is certainly correct, because then Eqs."
20823,Their ratio is given by either Eq.
20824,(9.23) or Eq.
20825,(9.24).
20826,They must also satisfy one more condition.
20827,Let’s go back now to our particular example of the ammonia molecule in an electric field.
20828,9–2.
20829,"When an electric field is applied, the splitting between the two levels increases."
20830,(The curve is a hyperbola.)
20831,This is an interesting point which we will come back to again later.
20832,We are at last ready to understand the operation of the ammonia maser.
20833,The idea is the following.
20834,The energy from the molecules will appear as electrical energy in the cavity.
20835,How can we separate the two molecular states?
20836,One method is as follows.
20837,"The ammonia gas is let out of a little jet and passed through a pair of slits to give a narrow beam, as shown in Fig."
20838,9–3.
20839,The beam is then sent through a region in which there is a large transverse electric field.
20840,The electrodes to produce the field are shaped so that the electric field varies rapidly across the beam.
20841,"In such cases, the square root in Eqs."
20842,The coefficient is the polarizability of the molecule.
20843,"Thus, ammonia molecules are unusually sensitive to an electric field."
20844,9–4.
20845,The other beam is discarded.
20846,"Inside the cavity, there will be a time-varying electric field, so the next problem we must discuss is the behavior of a molecule in an electric field that varies with time."
20847,We have a completely different kind of a problem—one with a time-varying Hamiltonian.
20848,(9.13).
20849,(9.9) with an extra term due to the electric field.
20850,"Now the question is, how to solve these equations?"
20851,"However, we can get a good approximation so long as the electric field is small."
20852,Now the idea of writing our equations in the form of Eq.
20853,That is the trick.
20854,"Now we have an apparently simple pair of equations—and they are still exact, of course."
20855,"Although these simple equations cannot be solved in general, we will solve them for some special cases."
20856,"We are, for the moment at least, interested only in the case of an oscillating electric field."
20857,"So we can make a reasonably good approximation by replacing these terms by their average value, namely, zero."
20858,With the approximation made in getting Eq.
20859,"(9.45), the equations can be solved exactly, but the work is a little elaborate, so we won’t do that until later when we take up another problem of the same type."
20860,Let’s take the case of perfect resonance first.
20861,The time variation of the two probabilities is shown in Fig.
20862,9–5.
20863,"Needless to say, the sum of the two probabilities is always equal to one; the molecule is always in some state!"
20864,"If it enters the cavity in the upper state, it will leave the cavity in the lower state."
20865,"In other words, its energy is decreased, and the loss of energy can’t go anywhere else but into the machinery which generates the field."
20866,"The details by which you can see how the energy of the molecule is fed into the oscillations of the cavity are not simple; however, we don’t need to study these details, because we can use the principle of conservation of energy."
20867,"(We could study them if we had to, but then we would have to deal with the quantum mechanics of the field in the cavity in addition to the quantum mechanics of the atom.)"
20868,"In summary: the molecule enters the cavity, the cavity field—oscillating at exactly the right frequency—induces transitions from the upper to the lower state, and the energy released is fed into the oscillating field."
20869,In an operating maser the molecules deliver enough energy to maintain the cavity oscillations—not only providing enough power to make up for the cavity losses but even providing small amounts of excess power that can be drawn from the cavity.
20870,"Thus, the molecular energy is converted into the energy of an external electromagnetic field."
20871,"Remember that before the beam enters the cavity, we have to use a filter which separates the beam so that only the upper state enters."
20872,"It is easy to demonstrate that if you were to start with molecules in the lower state, the process will go the other way and take energy out of the cavity."
20873,"If you put the unfiltered beam in, as many molecules are taking energy out as are putting energy in, so nothing much would happen."
20874,"In actual use, the velocity of all the molecules is not the same; they have some kind of Maxwell distribution."
20875,"In addition, there is another complication which is easy to take into account, but we don’t want to bother with it at this stage."
20876,You remember that the electric field in a cavity usually varies from place to place across the cavity.
20877,"Thus, as the molecules drift across the cavity, the electric field at the molecule varies in a way that is more complicated than the simple sinusoidal oscillation in time that we have assumed."
20878,"Clearly, one would have to use a more complicated integration to do the problem exactly, but the general idea is still the same."
20879,There are other ways of making masers.
20880,One way is one used in the so-called three-state maser.
20881,"For it, atomic systems are used which have three energy levels, as shown in Fig."
20882,"9–6, with the following special properties."
20883,"Although such a device is called a “three-state” maser, the maser operation really works just as a two-state system such as we are describing."
20884,A laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is just a maser working at optical frequencies.
20885,The “cavity” for a laser usually consists of just two plane mirrors between which standing waves are generated.
20886,"Then, even in the case of perfect resonance which we have just worked out, the probability of making a transition is small."
20887,Then the problem is very easy.
20888,9–7.
20889,"We have seen a curve like this in the diffraction theory, so you should already be familiar with it."
20890,Let’s examine the implication of our results for a real maser.
20891,"Suppose that the ammonia molecule is in the cavity for a reasonable length of time, say for one millisecond."
20892,"Such an effect is the basis of the great precision that can be obtained with “atomic” clocks, which work on the maser principle."
20893,Our treatment above applies to a more general situation than the ammonia maser.
20894,"We have treated the behavior of a molecule under the influence of an electric field, whether that field was confined in a cavity or not."
20895,So we could be simply shining a beam of “light”—at microwave frequencies—at the molecule and ask for the probability of emission or absorption.
20896,"Our equations apply equally well to this case, but let’s rewrite them in terms of the intensity of the radiation rather than the electric field."
20897,Ordinarily the light shining on such a system is not exactly monochromatic.
20898,The two functions might appear as shown in Fig.
20899,9–8.
20900,What remains is just the integral under the curve of Fig.
20901,"This is an important result, because it is the general theory of the absorption of light by any molecular or atomic system."
20902,"For any particular case, it is always worked out in just the way we have done here and gives an expression like Eq."
20903,(9.55).
20904,"We, therefore, emphasize the following features of this result."
20905,"In other words, there is a constant probability per unit time that transitions will occur."
20906,"Second, this probability is proportional to the intensity of the light incident on the system."
20907,"Here, we have at last the quantum mechanical procedure for computing these coefficients."
20908,"The quantum mechanical theory of the absorption and emission of light is, therefore, reduced to a calculation of these matrix elements for particular atomic systems."
20909,Our study of a simple two-state system has thus led us to an understanding of the general problem of the absorption and emission of light.
20910,In the last chapter we discussed some aspects of the ammonia molecule under the approximation that it can be considered as a two-state system.
20911,"It is, of course, not really a two-state system—there are many states of rotation, vibration, translation, and so on—but each of these states of motion must be analyzed in terms of two internal states because of the flip-flop of the nitrogen atom."
20912,"Here we are going to consider other examples of systems which, to some approximation or other, can be considered as two-state systems."
20913,"Lots of things will be approximate because there are always many other states, and in a more accurate analysis they would have to be taken into account."
20914,But in each of our examples we will be able to understand a great deal by just thinking about two states.
20915,"Since we will only be dealing with two-state systems, the Hamiltonian we need will look just like the one we used in the last chapter."
20916,"When the Hamiltonian is independent of time, we know that there are two stationary states with definite—and usually different—energies."
20917,"Generally, however, we start our analysis with a set of base states which are not these stationary states, but states which may, perhaps, have some other simple physical meaning."
20918,"Then, the stationary states of the system will be represented by a linear combination of these base states."
20919,"For convenience, we will summarize the important equations from Chapter 9."
20920,Now we will use these results to discuss a number of interesting examples taken from the fields of chemistry and physics.
20921,The first example is the hydrogen molecular ion.
20922,A positively ionized hydrogen molecule consists of two protons with one electron worming its way around them.
20923,"If the two protons are very far apart, what states would we expect for this system?"
20924,"The answer is pretty clear: The electron will stay close to one proton and form a hydrogen atom in its lowest state, and the other proton will remain alone as a positive ion."
20925,"So, if the two protons are far apart, we can visualize one physical state in which the electron is “attached” to one of the protons."
20926,"There is, clearly, another state symmetric to that one in which the electron is near the other proton, and the first proton is the one that is an ion."
20927,They are sketched in Fig.
20928,10–1.
20929,"Of course, there are really many states of an electron near a proton, because the combination can exist as any one of the excited states of the hydrogen atom."
20930,"We are not interested in that variety of states now; we will consider only the situation in which the hydrogen atom is in the lowest state—its ground state—and we will, for the moment, disregard spin of the electron."
20931,"So long as the two protons of the hydrogen molecular ion are far apart, it still requires about this much energy—which is for our present considerations a great deal of energy—to get the electron somewhere near the midpoint between the protons."
20932,"So it is impossible, classically, for the electron to jump from one proton to the other."
20933,"However, in quantum mechanics it is possible—though not very likely."
20934,There is some small amplitude for the electron to move from one proton to the other.
20935,You see that this is the same game we played in the last two chapters.
20936,"If we disregard the fact that the electron can flip back and forth, we have two states of exactly the same energy."
20937,"This energy will, however, be split into two energy levels by the possibility of the electron going back and forth—the greater the probability of the transition, the greater the split."
20938,(10.7).
20939,"From our solution we see that if a proton and a hydrogen atom are put anywhere near together, the electron will not stay on one of the protons but will flip back and forth between the two protons."
20940,"In order to have the lowest energy solution (which does not vary with time), it is necessary to start the system with equal amplitudes for the electron to be around each proton."
20941,"Remember, there are not two electrons—we are not saying that there is an electron around each proton."
20942,"The closer the protons are together, the larger the amplitude."
20943,"You remember that we talked in Chapter 7 about the amplitude for an electron to “penetrate a barrier,” which it could not do classically."
20944,We have the same situation here.
20945,The amplitude for an electron to get across decreases roughly exponentially with the distance—for large distances.
20946,The variation of the two energies with the distance between the two protons should be roughly as shown in Fig.
20947,10–2.
20948,"We have, however, forgotten one thing."
20949,"In addition to the force we have just described, there is also an electrostatic repulsive force between the two protons."
20950,When the two protons are far apart—as in Fig.
20951,"10–1—the “bare” proton sees only a neutral atom, so there is a negligible electrostatic force."
20952,"At very close distances, however, the “bare” proton begins to get “inside” the electron distribution—that is, it is closer to the proton on the average than to the electron."
20953,"So there begins to be some extra electrostatic energy which is, of course, positive."
20954,10–2 which rises rapidly for distances less than the radius of a hydrogen atom.
20955,10–3.
20956,"[In this figure, we have plotted the results of a more detailed calculation."
20957,"The energy at this point is lower than the energy of a separated proton and hydrogen ion, so the system is bound."
20958,A single electron acts to hold the two protons together.
20959,A chemist would call it a “one-electron bond.”
20960,This kind of chemical binding is also often called “quantum mechanical resonance” (by analogy with the two coupled pendulums we have described before).
20961,"But that really sounds more mysterious than it is, it’s only a “resonance” if you start out by making a poor choice for your base states—as we did also!"
20962,We can see in another way why such a state should have a lower energy than a proton and a hydrogen atom.
20963,"Let’s think about an electron near two protons with some fixed, but not too large, separation."
20964,You remember that with a single proton the electron is “spread out” because of the uncertainty principle.
20965,"Now if there are two protons, there is more space where the electron can have a low potential energy."
20966,It can spread out—lowering its kinetic energy—without increasing its potential energy.
20967,The net result is a lower energy than a proton and a hydrogen atom.
20968,"This means that the electron is somewhat more confined, which leads to a larger energy."
20969,"10–3, and so, will not give a good value for the actual binding energy."
20970,"For small separations, the energies of the two “states” we imagined in Fig."
20971,"Suppose we ask now what would happen if instead of two protons, we had two different objects—as, for example, one proton and one lithium positive ion (both particles still with a single positive charge)."
20972,We can now see why the binding of unsymmetric diatomic molecules is generally very weak.
20973,The attractive force comes from the reduced energy of the system due to the possibility of the electron jumping from one proton to the other.
20974,"In such a jump the system changes from the configuration (hydrogen atom, proton) to the configuration (proton, hydrogen atom), or switches back."
20975,"In this space, then, the electron moves nearly like a free particle in empty space—but with a negative energy!"
20976,We have seen in Chapter 3 [Eq.
20977,"The new effect we are thinking of is the electrostatic attraction of the proton for the hydrogen atom, which comes about in the same way any charged object attracts a neutral object."
20978,So there is a term in the energy of the system which decreases with the fourth power of the distance.
20979,(One usually says that there is an exchange of a “virtual” electron when—as here—the electron has to jump across a space where it would have a negative energy.
20980,"More specifically, a “virtual exchange” means that the phenomenon involves a quantum mechanical interference between an exchanged state and a nonexchanged state.)"
20981,Now we might ask the following question: Could it be that forces between other kinds of particles have an analogous origin?
20982,"What about, for example, the nuclear force between a neutron and a proton, or between two protons?"
20983,(10.9).
20984,We get an energy variation in the form of the so-called Yukawa potential between two nucleons.
20985,"Incidentally, we obtained this same formula earlier directly from the differential equation for the motion of a pion in free space [see Chapter 28, Vol."
20986,"II, Eq."
20987,(28.18)].
20988,"If we have two protons, proton No."
20989,"At the end, we still have two protons."
20990,"Such processes are, in fact, observed in high-energy collisions."
20991,All the same arguments give an equal interaction energy for two neutrons.
20992,"Since the nuclear forces (disregarding electrical effects) between neutron and proton, between proton and proton, between neutron and neutron are the same, we conclude that the masses of the charged and neutral pions should be the same."
20993,"Experimentally, the masses are indeed very nearly equal, and the small difference is about what one would expect from electric self-energy corrections (see Chapter 28, Vol."
20994,II).
20995,There are other kinds of particles—like K-mesons—which can be exchanged between two nucleons.
20996,It is also possible for two pions to be exchanged at the same time.
20997,"And, indeed, those experiments which involve nuclear interactions only at large distances do show that the interaction energy is as predicted from the one-pion exchange theory."
20998,"In the classical theory of electricity and magnetism, the Coulomb electrostatic interaction and the radiation of light by an accelerating charge are closely related—both come out of the Maxwell equations."
20999,We have seen in the quantum theory that light can be represented as the quantum excitations of the harmonic oscillations of the classical electromagnetic fields in a box.
21000,"Alternatively, the quantum theory can be set up by describing light in terms of particles—photons—which obey Bose statistics."
21001,We emphasized in Section 4–5 that the two alternative points of view always give identical predictions.
21002,Can the second point of view be carried through completely to include all electromagnetic effects?
21003,"In particular, if we want to describe the electromagnetic field purely in terms of Bose particles—that is, in terms of photons—what is the Coulomb force due to?"
21004,From the “particle” point of view the Coulomb interaction between two electrons comes from the exchange of a virtual photon.
21005,"One electron emits a photon—as in reaction (10.16)—which goes over to the second electron, where it is absorbed in the reverse of the same reaction."
21006,"In the “particle” theory of electromagnetism, the process of a virtual photon exchange gives rise to all the phenomena of electrostatics."
21007,"It is, naturally, more complicated to understand because it has two electrons."
21008,"Again, we start by thinking of what happens when the two protons are well separated."
21009,Only now we have two electrons to add.
21010,10–4.
21011,We have simply two hydrogen atoms.
21012,"From the symmetry of the situation, those two possibilities should be energetically equivalent, but, as we will see, the energy of the system is not just the energy of two hydrogen atoms."
21013,We should mention that there are many other possibilities.
21014,"We’ll disregard such a case, since it will certainly have higher energy (because of the large Coulomb repulsion between the two electrons)."
21015,"For greater accuracy, we would have to include such states, but we can get the essentials of the molecular binding by considering just the two states of Fig."
21016,10–4.
21017,"This possibility of exchange means that the energy of the system is split, as we have seen for other two-state systems."
21018,"As for the hydrogen molecular ion, the splitting is very small when the distance between the protons is large."
21019,"As the protons approach each other, the amplitude for the electrons to go back and forth increases, so the splitting increases."
21020,The decrease of the lower energy state means that there is an attractive force which pulls the atoms together.
21021,Again the energy levels rise when the protons get very close together because of the Coulomb repulsion.
21022,The net final result is that the two stationary states have energies which vary with the separation as shown in Fig.
21023,10–5.
21024,Now you have probably been thinking of an objection.
21025,What about the fact that the two electrons are identical particles?
21026,"And we have said in Chapter 4 that for electrons—which are Fermi particles—if there are two ways something can happen by exchanging the electrons, the two amplitudes will interfere with a negative sign."
21027,"This means that if we switch which electron is which, the sign of the amplitude must reverse."
21028,These arguments are correct if both electrons have the same spin.
21029,Its curve of energy versus separation has no minimum.
21030,The two hydrogens will always repel and will not form a molecule.
21031,So we conclude that the hydrogen molecule cannot exist with parallel electron spins.
21032,And that is right.
21033,"We saw in Section 4–7 that if two Fermi particles are in the same state, they must have opposite spins."
21034,"So, the bound hydrogen molecule must have one electron with spin up and one with spin down."
21035,The whole story of the hydrogen molecule is really somewhat more complicated if we want to include the proton spins.
21036,It is then no longer right to think of the molecule as a two-state system.
21037,"Our final conclusions are, however, correct."
21038,The total spin angular momentum of the electrons is zero.
21039,There is an interesting correlation between the spins and the energies.
21040,"It gives another illustration of something we mentioned before, which is that there appears to be an “interaction” energy between two spins because the case of parallel spins has a higher energy than the opposite case."
21041,"In a certain sense you could say that the spins try to reach an antiparallel condition and, in doing so, have the potential to liberate energy—not because there is a large magnetic force, but because of the exclusion principle."
21042,We saw in Section 10–1 that the binding of two different ions by a single electron is likely to be quite weak.
21043,This is not true for binding by two electrons.
21044,Suppose the two protons in Fig.
21045,"10–4 were replaced by any two ions (with closed inner electron shells and a single ionic charge), and that the binding energies of an electron at the two ions are different."
21046,Two-electron binding is ubiquitous—it is the most common valence bond.
21047,Chemical binding usually involves this flip-flop game played by two electrons.
21048,"Although two atoms can be bound together by only one electron, it is relatively rare—because it requires just the right conditions."
21049,"Finally, we want to mention that if the energy of attraction for an electron to one nucleus is much greater than to the other, then what we have said earlier about ignoring other possible states is no longer right."
21050,The strong attraction may more than compensate for the mutual repulsion of the two electrons.
21051,The state looks like a negative ion with a positive ion.
21052,"This is, in fact, what happens in an “ionic” molecule like NaCl."
21053,You can see that all the gradations between covalent binding and ionic binding are possible.
21054,You can now begin to see how it is that many of the facts of chemistry can be most clearly understood in terms of a quantum mechanical description.
21055,Chemists have invented nice diagrams to represent complicated organic molecules.
21056,Now we are going to discuss one of the most interesting of them—the benzene molecule shown in Fig.
21057,10–6.
21058,It contains six carbon and six hydrogen atoms in a symmetrical array.
21059,"Each bar of the diagram represents a pair of electrons, with spins opposite, doing the covalent bond dance."
21060,"(There are two more electrons close to the nucleus of the carbon which form the first, or K, shell."
21061,These are not shown since they are so tightly bound that they are not appreciably involved in the covalent binding.)
21062,"So each bar in the figure represents a bond, or pair of electrons, and the double bonds mean that there are two pairs of electrons between alternate pairs of carbon atoms."
21063,There is a mystery about this benzene molecule.
21064,"We can calculate what energy should be required to form this chemical compound, because the chemists have measured the energies of various compounds which involve pieces of the ring—for instance, they know the energy of a double bond by studying ethylene, and so on."
21065,"We can, therefore, calculate the total energy we should expect for the benzene molecule."
21066,"The actual energy of the benzene ring, however, is much lower than we get by such a calculation; it is more tightly bound than we would expect from what is called an “unsaturated double bond system.” Usually a double bond system which is not in such a ring is easily attacked chemically because it has a relatively high energy—the double bonds can be easily broken by the addition of other hydrogens."
21067,But in benzene the ring is quite permanent and hard to break up.
21068,"In other words, benzene has a much lower energy than you would calculate from the bond picture."
21069,Then there is another mystery.
21070,Suppose we replace two adjacent hydrogens by bromine atoms to make ortho-dibromobenzene.
21071,"There are two ways to do this, as shown in Fig."
21072,10–7.
21073,"The bromines could be on the opposite ends of a double bond as shown in part (a) of the figure, or could be on the opposite ends of a single bond as in (b)."
21074,"One would think that ortho-dibromobenzene should have two different forms, but it doesn’t."
21075,There is only one such chemical.2
21076,"Now we want to resolve these mysteries—and perhaps you have already guessed how: by noticing, of course, that the “ground state” of the benzene ring is really a two-state system."
21077,We could imagine that the bonds in benzene could be in either of the two arrangements shown in Fig.
21078,10–8.
21079,"You say, “But they are really the same; they should have the same energy.” Indeed, they should."
21080,And for that reason they must be analyzed as a two-state system.
21081,"As we have seen, this chance of flipping makes a mixed state whose energy is lower than you would calculate by looking separately at either of the two pictures in Fig."
21082,10–8.
21083,"Instead, there are two stationary states—one with an energy above and one with an energy below the expected value."
21084,"So actually, the true normal state (lowest energy) of benzene is neither of the possibilities shown in Fig."
21085,It is the only state that is involved in the chemistry of benzene at normal temperatures.
21086,"You will remember that in ammonia, where the object flipping back and forth was three protons, the energy separation was in the microwave region."
21087,What happens if we substitute bromine?
21088,Again the two “possibilities” (a) and (b) in Fig.
21089,10–7 represent the two different electron configurations.
21090,The only difference is that the two base states we start with would have slightly different energies.
21091,"The lowest energy stationary state will still involve a linear combination of the two states, but with unequal amplitudes."
21092,"This means, of course, that one of the two possibilities in the figure is more likely than the other, but the electrons are mobile enough so that there is some amplitude for both."
21093,"There is only one lowest state, not two as the naive theory of fixed chemical bonds would suggest."
21094,We will give you one more chemical example of the two-state phenomenon—this time on a larger molecular scale.
21095,It has to do with the theory of dyes.
21096,"Many dyes—in fact, most artificial dyes—have an interesting characteristic; they have a kind of symmetry."
21097,"Figure 10–9 shows an ion of a particular dye called magenta, which has a purplish red color."
21098,The molecule has three ring structures—two of which are benzene rings.
21099,The third is not exactly the same as a benzene ring because it has only two double bonds inside the ring.
21100,"The figure shows two equally satisfactory pictures, and we would guess that they should have equal energies."
21101,"But there is a certain amplitude that all the electrons can flip from one condition to the other, shifting the position of the “unfilled” position to the opposite end."
21102,"With so many electrons involved, the flipping amplitude is somewhat lower than it is in the case of benzene, and the difference in energy between the two stationary states is smaller."
21103,"If one shines light on the molecule, there is a very strong absorption at one frequency, and it appears to be brightly colored."
21104,That’s why it’s a dye!
21105,"Another interesting feature of such a dye molecule is that in the two base states shown, the center of electric charge is located at different places."
21106,"As a result, the molecule should be strongly affected by an external electric field."
21107,We had a similar effect in the ammonia molecule.
21108,"Generally, these are obtained by gathering experimental data."
21109,"If one makes measurements with many dyes, it is often possible to guess what will happen with some related dye molecule."
21110,"Therefore, it is not only colored but very strongly so—a small amount of substance absorbs a lot of light."
21111,"Also, the molecules do not have to be perfectly symmetrical."
21112,"We have seen that the same basic phenomenon exists with slight modifications, even if there is some small asymmetry present."
21113,"So, one can get some modification of the colors by introducing slight asymmetries in the molecules."
21114,Now we would like to discuss a two-state system involving an object of spin one-half.
21115,"Some of what we will say has been covered in earlier chapters, but doing it again may help to make some of the puzzling points a little clearer."
21116,We can think of an electron at rest as a two-state system.
21117,"Although we will be talking in this section about “an electron,” what we find out will be true for any spin one-half particle."
21118,"To treat this problem, we will need to know the Hamiltonian for this two-state system—that is, for an electron in a magnetic field."
21119,What is the Hamiltonian?
21120,We are going to make an assumption that there is a kind of superposition principle for the terms of the Hamiltonian.
21121,Just choosing our axes in a different direction won’t change the physics.
21122,The rest of the game is easy.
21123,We have here the formulas for the energies.
21124,(10.3).
21125,The problem: find the Hamiltonian.
21126,"First, notice that the energy splitting is symmetric, with an average value of zero."
21127,Looking at Eq.
21128,Now if we equate the energies of Eq.
21129,(10.3) with what we know from Eq.
21130,We can make a simple guess that will satisfy Eq.
21131,Which sign and phase should we use?
21132,"It turns out that you can choose either sign, and any phase you want, and the physical results will always be the same."
21133,So the choice is a matter of convention.
21134,So we have discovered the “equations of motion for the spin states” of an electron in a magnetic field.
21135,"We guessed at them by making some physical argument, but the real test of any Hamiltonian is that it should give predictions in agreement with experiment."
21136,"According to any tests that have been made, these equations are right."
21137,"In fact, although we made our arguments only for constant fields, the Hamiltonian we have written is also right for magnetic fields which vary with time."
21138,So we can now use Eq.
21139,(10.23) to look at all kinds of interesting problems.
21140,Then the equations look like our old two-state problem.
21141,"We get the flip-flop business once more, and the energy levels are split a little farther apart."
21142,The equations are then the same as we had when we put an oscillating electric field on the ammonia molecule in Chapter 9.
21143,You can work out the details in the same way.
21144,This gives the quantum mechanical theory of the magnetic resonance phenomena we described in Chapter 35 of Volume II.
21145,It is also possible to make a maser which uses a spin one-half system.
21146,The oscillating fields in the cavity can couple with the magnetic moment and induce transitions which give energy to the cavity.
21147,Now let’s look at the following question.
21148,10–10.
21149,"Suppose, additionally, that there is an electron which has been prepared with its spin pointing along this field."
21150,The answer to this question is also in our general equations for two-state systems.
21151,Using these matrix elements in Eq.
21152,"That’s not hard, but we can make a short cut with a little trick."
21153,Then Eq.
21154,People generally prefer to make Eqs.
21155,Now we notice an interesting thing.
21156,This means that we have answered in general the question of how to represent a particle whose spin is along an arbitrary axis.
21157,The amplitudes of (10.30) are the projection amplitudes for spin one-half particles corresponding to the projection amplitudes we gave in Chapter 5 [Eqs.
21158,(5.38)] for spin-one particles.
21159,We can now find the amplitudes for filtered beams of spin one-half particles to go through any particular Stern-Gerlach filter.
21160,"(6.36), by purely geometrical arguments."
21161,"(So if you decided to skip Chapter 6, you now have the essential results anyway.)"
21162,As our final example lets look again at one which we’ve already mentioned a number of times.
21163,Suppose that we consider the following problem.
21164,What is the final state?
21165,(10.30).
21166,What state is that?
21167,That’s easy.
21168,This result we discussed several times previously in a less complete and rigorous manner.
21169,Now we have obtained a complete and accurate quantum mechanical description of the precession of atomic magnets.
21170,It is interesting that the mathematical ideas we have just gone over for the spinning electron in a magnetic field can be applied to any two-state system.
21171,"That means that by making a mathematical analogy to the spinning electron, any problem about two-state systems can be solved by pure geometry."
21172,It works like this.
21173,Then any two-state problem is formally the same as the electron in a magnetic field.
21174,"No matter what the physics is originally—an ammonia molecule, or whatever—you can translate it into a corresponding electron problem."
21175,"So if we can solve the electron problem in general, we have solved all two-state problems."
21176,And we have the general solution for the electron!
21177,See Fig.
21178,10–11.
21179,"You see, it’s just a geometric problem to keep track of where you end up after all the rotating."
21180,"Although it’s easy to see what’s involved, this geometric problem (of finding the net result of a rotation with a varying angular velocity vector) is not easy to solve explicitly in the general case."
21181,"Anyway, we see, in principle, the general solution to any two-state problem."
21182,"In the next chapter we will look some more into the mathematical techniques for handling the important case of a spin one-half particle—and, therefore, for handling two-state systems in general."
21183,We continue our discussion of two-state systems.
21184,At the end of the last chapter we were talking about a spin one-half particle in a magnetic field.
21185,The two-state system of the electron spin is so important that it is very useful to have a neater way of writing things.
21186,We will now make a little mathematical digression to show you how people usually write the equations of a two-state system.
21187,Let’s see what they have to be.
21188,(11.2) and (11.4) are identical.
21189,Then Eq.
21190,(Anyone who is going to work in quantum physics really has to memorize them.)
21191,They are also called the Pauli spin matrices after the physicist who invented them.
21192,"In the table we have included one more two-by-two matrix which is needed if we want to be able to take care of a system which has two spin states of the same energy, or if we want to choose a different zero energy."
21193,One reason the spin matrices are useful is that any two-by-two matrix at all can be written in terms of them.
21194,"Since any two-by-two matrix can be represented in terms of the unit matrix and the sigma matrices, we have all that we ever need for any two-state system."
21195,"No matter what the two-state system—the ammonia molecule, the magenta dye, anything—the Hamiltonian equation can be written in terms of the sigmas."
21196,"Although the sigmas seem to have a geometrical significance in the physical situation of an electron in a magnetic field, they can also be thought of as just useful matrices, which can be used for any two-state problem."
21197,"For instance, in one way of looking at things a proton and a neutron can be thought of as the same particle in either of two states."
21198,"We say the nucleon (proton or neutron) is a two-state system—in this case, two states with respect to its charge."
21199,People say that the nucleon has two “isotopic-spin” states.
21200,"Since we will be using the sigma matrices as the “arithmetic” of the quantum mechanics of two-state systems, let’s review quickly the conventions of matrix algebra."
21201,By the “sum” of any two or more matrices we mean just what was obvious in Eq.
21202,(11.4).
21203,In Section 5–6 we have already encountered the idea of a matrix “product.” The same idea will be useful in dealing with the sigma matrices.
21204,If the matrices are written out in tabular form as in Fig.
21205,"11-1, there is a good “system” for getting the terms of the product matrix."
21206,We have tried to indicate how to do it in the figure.
21207,"It is, of course, particularly simple for two-by-two matrices."
21208,(Remember that a number times a matrix just multiplies each term of the matrix.)
21209,Since the products of the sigmas taken two at a time are important—as well as rather amusing—we have listed them all in Table 11–2.
21210,"Although it takes a lot of algebra, you can show that they change among themselves like the components of a vector."
21211,"(We won’t, however, worry about proving it right now."
21212,You can check it if you want.)
21213,"It is, in fact, just equal to the energy in the simple situation where there is only one state."
21214,"Even for two-state systems of the electron spin, when we write the Hamiltonian as in Eq."
21215,We can imagine that Eq.
21216,"Then, after this purely formal substitution, we interpret the result as a matrix equation."
21217,It is sometimes said that to each quantity in classical physics there corresponds a matrix in quantum mechanics.
21218,"It is really more correct to say that the Hamiltonian matrix corresponds to the energy, and any quantity that can be defined via energy has a corresponding matrix."
21219,Then we look at the formula for the Hamiltonian of a real (quantum) object in a magnetic field and try to identify whatever the matrices are that correspond to the various quantities in the classical formula.
21220,That’s the trick by which sometimes classical quantities have their quantum counterparts.
21221,That’s not the idea—they are not equal.
21222,Quantum mechanics is a different kind of a theory to represent the world.
21223,It just happens that there are certain correspondences which are hardly more than mnemonic devices—things to remember with.
21224,"That is, you remember Eq."
21225,(11.13).
21226,"Of course, nature knows the quantum mechanics, and the classical mechanics is only an approximation; so there is no mystery in the fact that in classical mechanics there is some shadow of quantum mechanical laws—which are truly the ones underneath."
21227,"To reconstruct the original object from the shadow is not possible in any direct way, but the shadow does help you to remember what the object looks like."
21228,"Equation (11.13) is the truth, and Eq."
21229,(11.14) is the shadow.
21230,"Because we learn classical mechanics first, we would like to be able to get the quantum formula from it, but there is no sure-fire scheme for doing that."
21231,We must always go back to the real world and discover the correct quantum mechanical equations.
21232,"When they come out looking like something in classical physics, we are in luck."
21233,"If the warnings above seem repetitious and appear to you to be belaboring self-evident truths about the relation of classical physics to quantum physics, please excuse the conditioned reflexes of a professor who has usually taught quantum mechanics to students who hadn’t heard about Pauli spin matrices until they were in graduate school."
21234,"Then they always seemed to be hoping that, somehow, quantum mechanics could be seen to follow as a logical consequence of classical mechanics which they had learned thoroughly years before."
21235,(Perhaps they wanted to avoid having to learn something new.)
21236,"You have learned the classical formula, Eq."
21237,"(11.14), only a few months ago—and then with warnings that it was inadequate—so maybe you will not be so unwilling to take the quantum formula, Eq."
21238,"(11.13), as the basic truth."
21239,"While we are on the subject of mathematical notation, we would like to describe still another way of writing things—a way which is used very often because it is so compact."
21240,It follows directly from the notation introduced in Chapter 8.
21241,(All of this is implicit in the discussion of Section 8–4.)
21242,Although the two equations (11.18) and (11.19) mean exactly the same thing as Eq.
21243,(11.17) or Eq.
21244,"(11.15), we can think about them in a different way."
21245,"For instance, we would describe Eq."
21246,(11.19) is described this way.
21247,"(11.17), but, as you will see, it can be a great convenience."
21248,"If we wish, we can carry the “abstraction” idea one more step."
21249,Remember that this equation—as well as Eq.
21250,The equations are the dynamical law of nature—the law of motion—for a quantum system.
21251,"Just to get some practice with these ideas, we will show you another way we could get to Eq."
21252,(11.18).
21253,So Eq.
21254,(11.18) all over again.
21255,So we have many ways of looking at the Hamiltonian.
21256,It all means the same thing.
21257,Now let’s go back to our two-state systems.
21258,So we will usually want to put Eq.
21259,Now you will see why the operator idea is so neat.
21260,To use Eq.
21261,Let’s find out.
21262,"If we have products of sigma matrices, they go over into products of operators."
21263,"When two operators appear together as a product, you carry out first the operation with the operator which is farthest to the right."
21264,So again we see the correspondence between the matrix and operator points of view.
21265,"Each of the equations in Table 11–2 can, therefore, also be considered as equations about the sigma operators."
21266,You can check that they do indeed follow from Table 11–3.
21267,"All the equations are the same either way, so Table 11–2 is for sigma operators, or for sigma matrices, as you wish."
21268,(11.8) or by Eq.
21269,(11.13).
21270,"The same is true, of course, for a magnetic field along any other direction, because the physics is independent of the coordinate system."
21271,"If we have a situation where the magnetic field varies from time to time in a complicated way, then we can analyze the situation in the following way."
21272,The spin starts to turn.
21273,"So depending on how the fields vary in time, you can figure out what the final state is—along what axis it will point."
21274,That solves any problem.
21275,It is a word description of the solution of the differential equations.
21276,The solution just described is sufficiently general to take care of any two-state system.
21277,Let’s take our example of the ammonia molecule—including the effects of an electric field.
21278,"Now if corresponding equations always have the same solutions, then we really don’t have to do it twice."
21279,If we look at these equations and look at Eq.
21280,"(11.1), then we can make the following identification."
21281,It is purely artificial.
21282,"Then, the equations will be identified as follows."
21283,"Unfortunately, we do not have the time to go any further into the details of this correspondence, or to work out any of the technical details."
21284,We only wished to make the point that all systems of two states can be made analogous to a spin one-half object precessing in a magnetic field.
21285,"There are a number of other two-state systems which are interesting to study, and the first new one we would like to talk about is the photon."
21286,To describe a photon we must first give its vector momentum.
21287,"For a free photon, the frequency is determined by the momentum, so we don’t have to say also what the frequency is."
21288,"After that, though, we still have a property called the polarization."
21289,Imagine that there is a photon coming at you with a definite monochromatic frequency (which will be kept the same throughout all this discussion so that we don’t have a variety of momentum states).
21290,Then there are two directions of polarization.
21291,"(This is just a quick reminder of the classical theory of polarized light that we studied in Chapter 33, Vol."
21292,I.)
21293,"Now, however, suppose we have a single photon—just one."
21294,There is no electric field that we can discuss in the same way.
21295,All we have is one photon.
21296,But a photon has to have the analog of the classical phenomena of polarization.
21297,There must be at least two different kinds of photons.
21298,"At first, you might think there should be an infinite variety—after all, the electric vector can point in all sorts of directions."
21299,"We can, however, describe the polarization of a photon as a two-state system."
21300,"So everything we did before with particles and Stern-Gerlach apparatuses, we can do again with light and pieces of calcite."
21301,Is that another state?
21302,"Yes, indeed, it is another state."
21303,See Fig.
21304,11-2.
21305,11-3; what will happen?
21306,With what probability will it get through?
21307,The answer is the following.
21308,Just multiply Eq.
21309,Now let us see what happens classically in the same situation.
21310,11-4.
21311,The classical picture and the quantum picture give similar results.
21312,"That is, of course, impossible if there is only one photon."
21313,"It is either all there, or it isn’t there at all."
21314,The relation of the two theories is clear.
21315,What about the other kinds of polarization?
21316,"For example, right-hand circular polarization?"
21317,"With these states you can calculate any filtering or interference effects you want, using the laws of quantum theory."
21318,(8.13)] and multiplying it by the other.
21319,"Just as an example, let’s try to turn our formulas around."
21320,Proof: Add and subtract the two equations in (11.34).
21321,It is easy to go from one base to the other.
21322,"One curious point has to be made, though."
21323,"If we were to look at the same thing from a coordinate system turned at some angle about the direction of flight, the light would still be right circularly polarized—and similarly for left."
21324,Isn’t that nice—it doesn’t take any axes to define it.
21325,Now you see what happens.
21326,So it is not exactly true that a circularly polarized photon looks the same for any set of axes.
21327,We will now describe a two-state system in the world of the strange particles—a system for which quantum mechanics gives a most remarkable prediction.
21328,"To describe it completely would involve us in a lot of stuff about strange particles, so we will, unfortunately, have to cut some corners."
21329,We can only give an outline of how a certain discovery was made—to show you the kind of reasoning that was involved.
21330,It begins with the discovery by Gell-Mann and Nishijima of the concept of strangeness and of a new law of conservation of strangeness.
21331,It was when Gell-Mann and Pais were analyzing the consequences of these new ideas that they came across the prediction of a most remarkable phenomenon we are going to describe.
21332,"First, though, we have to tell you a little about “strangeness.”"
21333,We must begin with what are called the strong interactions of nuclear particles.
21334,"These are the interactions which are responsible for the strong nuclear forces—as distinct, for instance, from the relatively weaker electromagnetic interactions."
21335,"The interactions are “strong” in the sense that if two particles get close enough to interact at all, they interact in a big way and produce other particles very easily."
21336,"The nuclear particles have also what is called a “weak interaction” by which certain things can happen, such as beta decay, but always very slowly on a nuclear time scale—the weak interactions are many, many orders of magnitude weaker than the strong interactions and even much weaker than electromagnetic interactions."
21337,"When the strong interactions were being studied with the big accelerators, people were surprised to find that certain things that “should” happen—that were expected to happen—did not occur."
21338,"For instance, in some interactions a particle of a certain type did not appear when it was expected."
21339,Gell-Mann and Nishijima noticed that many of these peculiar happenings could be explained at once by inventing a new conservation law: the conservation of strangeness.
21340,They proposed that there was a new kind of attribute associated with each particle—which they called its “strangeness” number—and that in any strong interaction the “quantity of strangeness” is conserved.
21341,"Suppose, for instance, that a high-energy negative K-meson—with, say, an energy of many GeV—collides with a proton."
21342,I.
21343,"It is observed, however, that only certain combinations appear, and never others."
21344,Now certain conservation laws were already known to apply.
21345,"First, energy and momentum are always conserved."
21346,The total energy and momentum after an event must be the same as before the event.
21347,"Second, there is the conservation of electric charge which says that the total charge of the outgoing particles must be equal to the total charge carried by the original particles."
21348,It was also known that the number of baryons is conserved.
21349,The number of baryons out must be equal to the number of baryons in.
21350,"For this law, an antiparticle of a baryon is counted as minus one baryon."
21351,We have made a list of these strangenesses in Table 11–4.
21352,Let’s see how the strangeness conservation works in some of the reactions we have written down.
21353,You see that that is so for the reactions of (11.38) and (11.40).
21354,But in the reactions of (11.42) the strangeness of the right-hand side is zero in each case.
21355,"Such reactions do not conserve strangeness, and do not occur."
21356,Why?
21357,Nobody knows.
21358,Nobody knows any more than what we have just told you about this.
21359,Nature just works that way.
21360,Now which neutral K do you get?
21361,They look exactly the same.
21362,"They are antiparticles of each other, so they have exactly the same mass, and both have zero electric charge."
21363,How do you distinguish them?” By the reactions they produce.
21364,The experiment might run something like this.
21365,11-5.
21366,"You can, however, figure out where it is going by using the conservation of momentum and energy."
21367,"[It could reveal itself later by disintegrating into two charged particles, as shown in Fig."
21368,11-5(a).]
21369,That’s the first part of our story.
21370,That’s the conservation of strangeness.
21371,"The conservation of strangeness is, however, not perfect."
21372,These are called the “weak” decays.
21373,"That was, in fact, the way K-particles were first seen."
21374,There is a principle that for any reaction there is the corresponding reaction with “matter” replaced by “antimatter” and vice versa.
21375,"(Or, if you prefer, vice versa."
21376,When “seen” through their decays—as in a bubble chamber—they look like the same particle.
21377,Only their strong interactions are different.
21378,At last we are ready to describe the work of Gell-Mann and Pais.
21379,Now—said Gell-Mann and Pais—here is an interesting situation.
21380,The other states were taken into account to the extent that their effects appeared implicitly in the amplitudes of Eq.
21381,(11.44).
21382,"Accordingly, Gell-Mann and Pais analyzed the neutral particle as a two-state system."
21383,"(From here on, the story goes very much as it did for the ammonia molecule.)"
21384,The next step was to write the Hamiltonian equations for this two-state system.
21385,But that’s not all.
21386,"If you wish, the argument can be written out in detail like this."
21387,That was true when we were talking about particles that did not decay.
21388,"But if particles can decay—and can, therefore, become “lost”—the two amplitudes are not necessarily complex conjugates."
21389,So the equality of (11.44) does not mean that the amplitudes are real numbers; they are in fact complex numbers.
21390,"Having played often with electron spins and such, our heroes knew that the Hamiltonian equations of (11.47) meant that there was another pair of base states which could also be used to represent the K-particle system and which would have especially simple behaviors."
21391,"They said, “Let’s take the sum and difference of these two equations."
21392,It doesn’t change the physics but makes the equations take on a simple form.)
21393,So they concluded that it would be more convenient to use a different representation for the K-particle.
21394,We are not using our old notation because we want now to follow the notation of the original authors—and the one you will see in physics seminars.)
21395,Now Gell-Mann and Pais didn’t do all this just to get different names for the particles—there is also some strange new physics in it.
21396,"And, from Eqs."
21397,Where does it go?
21398,"On the other hand, Eq."
21399,"Well, that’s not really true."
21400,So there are some other small terms we have left out in our approximation.
21401,Now to finish the story of Gell-Mann and Pais.
21402,In Eqs.
21403,What does all this mean?
21404,Let’s go back and think of the experiment we sketched in Fig.
21405,11-5.
21406,"As it goes along, there is some small but uniform chance that it will collide with a hydrogen nucleus."
21407,"Now, however, we see that that is not right."
21408,(11.56).
21409,This prediction came from using only sheer logic and the basic principles of the quantum mechanics—with no knowledge at all of the inner workings of the K-particle.
21410,"Since nobody knows anything about the inner machinery, that is as far as Gell-Mann and Pais could go."
21411,And nobody has been able to do so to this date.
21412,We have plotted the function of Eq.
21413,11-6.
21414,"Now, typically, the K-particle will be travelling at a constant speed near the speed of light."
21415,The curves of Fig.
21416,You can see why this prediction is so remarkably peculiar.
21417,"You produce a single particle and instead of just disintegrating, it does something else."
21418,"Sometimes it disintegrates, and other times it turns into a different kind of a particle."
21419,Its characteristic probability of producing an effect varies in a strange way as it goes along.
21420,There is nothing else quite like it in nature.
21421,And this most remarkable prediction was made solely by arguments about the interference of amplitudes.
21422,If there is any place where we have a chance to test the main principles of quantum mechanics in the purest way—does the superposition of amplitudes work or doesn’t it?—this is it.
21423,"In spite of the fact that this effect has been predicted now for several years, there is no experimental determination that is very clear."
21424,"That’s all there is, experimentally."
21425,"It would be very beautiful to check out the curve exactly to see if the principle of superposition really still works in such a mysterious world as that of the strange particles—with unknown reasons for the decays, and unknown reasons for the strangeness."
21426,The analysis we have just described is very characteristic of the way quantum mechanics is being used today in the search for an understanding of the strange particles.
21427,All the complicated theories that you may hear about are no more and no less than this kind of elementary hocus-pocus using the principles of superposition and other principles of quantum mechanics of that level.
21428,So the dynamical theories are wrong.
21429,It is really quite remarkable that the phenomena which can be predicted at all in the world of the strange particles come from the principles of quantum mechanics at the level at which you are learning them now.
21430,We have finished with all the two-state systems we wanted to talk about.
21431,In the following chapters we will go on to study systems with more states.
21432,It goes like this.
21433,It looks the same as for two states.
21434,It is also not difficult to solve Eq.
21435,"Again, we begin by looking for a possible solution in which the amplitudes all have the same time dependence."
21436,"If you want to be formal, however, you can write Eq."
21437,"(We must remember, however, that some of them may be multiple roots—meaning that two or more roots are equal.)"
21438,Then they are constant vectors which can be used as a new base set if we wish.
21439,"As we have seen, a Hamiltonian will, in general, have several characteristic energies."
21440,When it happens that Eq.
21441,"(11.63) accidentally has two (or more) roots with the same energy, there are some minor complications."
21442,(11.70) is true.
21443,It is always convenient to do this.
21444,"We would like, for fun, to prove that when two of the stationary states have different energies they are indeed orthogonal."
21445,(11.71).
21446,We multiply Eq.
21447,Then we multiply Eq.
21448,(11.75).
21449,Finally we are ready to show that the different energy states are orthogonal.
21450,Using Eq.
21451,"In this chapter we take up the “hyperfine splitting” of hydrogen, because it is a physically interesting example of what we can already do with quantum mechanics."
21452,"It’s an example with more than two states, and it will be illustrative of the methods of quantum mechanics as applied to slightly more complicated problems."
21453,It is enough more complicated that once you see how this one is handled you can get immediately the generalization to all kinds of problems.
21454,"As you know, the hydrogen atom consists of an electron sitting in the neighborhood of the proton, where it can exist in any one of a number of discrete energy states in each one of which the pattern of motion of the electron is different."
21455,"But even the so-called ground state of hydrogen is not really a single, definite-energy state, because of the spins of the electron and the proton."
21456,"These spins are responsible for the “hyperfine structure” in the energy levels, which splits all the energy levels into several nearly equal levels."
21457,"The electron can have its spin either “up” or “down,” and the proton can also have its spin either “up” or “down.” There are, therefore, four possible spin states for every dynamical condition of the atom."
21458,"That is, when people say “the ground state” of hydrogen, they really mean the “four ground states,” and not just the very lowest state."
21459,The four spin states do not all have exactly the same energy; there are slight shifts from the energies we would expect with no spins.
21460,"As a consequence, each dynamical state has its energy split into a set of very close energy levels—the so-called hyperfine splitting."
21461,The energy differences among the four spin states is what we want to calculate in this chapter.
21462,"The hyperfine splitting is due to the interaction of the magnetic moments of the electron and proton, which gives a slightly different magnetic energy for each spin state."
21463,"It is because of this large gap that we can think about the ground state of hydrogen as a “four-state” system, without worrying about the fact that there are really many more states at higher energies."
21464,We are going to limit ourselves here to a study of the hyperfine structure of the ground state of the hydrogen atom.
21465,For our purposes we are not interested in any of the details about the positions of the electron and proton because that has all been worked out by the atom so to speak—it has worked itself out by getting into the ground state.
21466,We need know only that we have an electron and proton in the neighborhood of each other with some definite spatial relationship.
21467,"In addition, they can have various different relative orientations of their spins."
21468,It is only the effect of the spins that we want to look into.
21469,The first question we have to answer is: What are the base states for the system?
21470,Now the question has been put incorrectly.
21471,"There is no such thing as “the” base states, because, of course, the set of base states you may choose is not unique."
21472,New sets can always be made out of linear combinations of the old.
21473,"There are always many choices for the base states, and among them, any choice is equally legitimate."
21474,"So the question is not what is the base set, but what could a base set be?"
21475,We can choose any one we wish for our own convenience.
21476,It is usually best to start with a base set which is physically the clearest.
21477,"It may not be the solution to any problem, or may not have any direct importance, but it will generally make it easier to understand what is going on."
21478,"For handy reference, we’ve also summarized the notation in Fig."
21479,12-1.
21480,"You may say, “But the particles interact, and maybe these aren’t the right base states."
21481,"It sounds as though you are considering the two particles independently.” Yes, indeed!"
21482,"The interaction raises the problem: what is the Hamiltonian for the system, but the interaction is not involved in the question of how to describe the system."
21483,What we choose for the base states has nothing to do with what happens next.
21484,"It may be that the atom cannot ever stay in one of these base states, even if it is started that way."
21485,That’s another question.
21486,That’s the question: How do the amplitudes change with time in a particular (fixed) base?
21487,"In choosing the base states, we are just choosing the “unit vectors” for our description."
21488,"While we’re on the subject, let’s look at the general problem of finding a set of base states when there is more than one particle."
21489,You know the base states for a single particle.
21490,"There must, therefore, be two amplitudes for every possible momentum (a multi-infinite set of base states)."
21491,That is all there is to describing a single particle.
21492,"When there is more than one particle, the base states can be written in a similar way."
21493,If there are more than two particles—same idea.
21494,So you see that to write down the possible base states is really very easy.
21495,"The only problem is, what is the Hamiltonian?"
21496,For our study of the ground state of hydrogen we don’t need to use the full sets of base states for the various momenta.
21497,"We are specifying particular momentum states for the proton and electron when we say “the ground state.” The details of the configuration—the amplitudes for all the momentum base states—can be calculated, but that is another problem."
21498,"Now we are concerned only with the effects of the spin, so we can take only the four base states of (12.1)."
21499,Our next problem is: What is the Hamiltonian for this set of states?
21500,We’ll tell you in a moment what it is.
21501,"But first, we should remind you of one thing: any state can always be written as a linear combination of the base states."
21502,"There is no general rule for writing down the Hamiltonian of an atomic system, and finding the right formula is much more of an art than finding a set of base states."
21503,"We were able to tell you a general rule for writing a set of base states for any problem of a proton and an electron, but to describe the general Hamiltonian of such a combination is too hard at this level."
21504,"Instead, we will lead you to a Hamiltonian by some heuristic argument—and you will have to accept it as the correct one because the results will agree with the test of experimental observation."
21505,"You will remember that in the last chapter we were able to describe the Hamiltonian of a single, spin one-half particle by using the sigma matrices—or the exactly equivalent sigma operators."
21506,The properties of the operators are summarized in Table 12-1.
21507,The question is: Can we find an analogous device to describe a system with two spins?
21508,"The answer is yes, very simply, as follows."
21509,"We now make the convention that when one of these things operates on any one of our four base states of the hydrogen atom, it acts only on the electron spin, and in exactly the same way as if the electron were all by itself."
21510,Next we define the corresponding operator “sigma proton” for the proton spin.
21511,Now in the most general case we could have more complex things.
21512,"We say that the operators “commute” with pure numbers, or that a number “can be moved through” the operator."
21513,"If we take all the possible operators, using each kind of operator only once, there are sixteen possibilities."
21514,And there’s the unit operator which just leaves any state unchanged.
21515,Sixteen in all.
21516,"Now note that for a four-state system, the Hamiltonian matrix has to be a four-by-four matrix of coefficients—it will have sixteen entries."
21517,"It is easily demonstrated that any four-by-four matrix—and, therefore, the Hamiltonian matrix in particular—can be written as a linear combination of the sixteen double-spin matrices corresponding to the set of operators we have just made up."
21518,"The only question is, how?"
21519,"Well, first, we know that the interaction doesn’t depend on our choice of axes for a coordinate system."
21520,"It would be ridiculous, because then somebody with a different coordinate system would get different results."
21521,"It’s the only thing that it can be, by the symmetry of space, so long as there is no external field."
21522,The constant term doesn’t tell us much; it just depends on the level we choose to measure energies from.
21523,The second term tells us all we need to know to find the level splitting of the hydrogen.
21524,"If you want to, you can think of the Hamiltonian in a different way."
21525,So Eq.
21526,"(12.5) says that the interaction energy is like the interaction between two magnets—only not quite, because the interaction of the two magnets depends on the radial distance between them."
21527,But Eq.
21528,"(12.5) could be—and, in fact, is—some kind of an average interaction."
21529,"The electron is moving all around inside the atom, and our Hamiltonian gives only the average interaction energy."
21530,"All it says is that for a prescribed arrangement in space for the electron and proton there is an energy proportional to the cosine of the angle between the two magnetic moments, speaking classically."
21531,"Such a classical qualitative picture may help you to understand where it comes from, but the important thing is that Eq."
21532,(12.5) is the correct quantum mechanical formula.
21533,The order of magnitude of the classical interaction between two magnets would be the product of the two magnetic moments divided by the cube of the distance between them.
21534,Such an estimate gives a number in the right ballpark.
21535,Taking the Hamiltonian of Eq.
21536,We get only the one term.
21537,"First, we will let you practice by checking out all of the sigma products we have written down in Table 12-2."
21538,Before solving these equations we can’t resist telling you about a clever rule due to Dirac—it will make you feel that you are really advanced—although we don’t need it for our work.
21539,That’s the formula of Dirac.
21540,"(You see, you can do everything now."
21541,The gates are open.)
21542,Now we are ready to work out the energy levels of the ground state of hydrogen by solving the Hamiltonian equations (12.14).
21543,We want to find the energies of the stationary states.
21544,"To see whether we can get such amplitudes, we substitute (12.17) into Eq."
21545,(12.14) and see what happens.
21546,Isn’t it nice that the first equation is independent of the rest—that means we can see one solution right away.
21547,Now it gets a little harder; the two equations left in (12.18) are mixed up.
21548,But we’ve done it all before.
21549,"Notice, incidentally, that our four states are orthogonal, so they also can be used for base states if desired."
21550,Our problem is completely solved.
21551,"(12.5), we were choosing to measure all the energies from the average energy."
21552,We can draw the energy-level diagram for the ground state of hydrogen as shown in Fig.
21553,12-2.
21554,"Not optical light, because the energy is so tiny—it would emit a microwave quantum."
21555,Probably no basic physical quantity is measured better than that—it’s one of the most remarkably accurate measurements in physics.
21556,So the experimenters are way ahead of the theorists.
21557,In the theory of the ground state of the hydrogen atom you are as good as anybody.
21558,Radiation of this wavelength is emitted or absorbed by the atomic hydrogen gas in the galaxies.
21559,"By measuring the intensity, we can estimate the amount of hydrogen."
21560,"By measuring the frequency shift due to the Doppler effect, we can find out about the motion of the gas in the galaxy."
21561,That is one of the big programs of radio astronomy.
21562,So now we are talking about something that’s very real—it is not an artificial problem.
21563,"Although we have finished the problem of finding the energy levels of the hydrogen ground state, we would like to study this interesting system some more."
21564,We have to do as we did for the ammonia molecule—after we found the energy levels we went on and studied what happened when the molecule was in an electric field.
21565,We were then able to figure out the effects from the electric field in a radio wave.
21566,"For the hydrogen atom, the electric field does nothing to the levels, except to move them all by some constant amount proportional to the square of the field—which is not of any interest because that won’t change the energy differences."
21567,It is now the magnetic field which is important.
21568,So the next step is to write the Hamiltonian for a more complicated situation in which the atom sits in an external magnetic field.
21569,"What, then, is the Hamiltonian?"
21570,"We’ll just tell you the answer, because we can’t give you any “proof” except to say that this is the way the atom works."
21571,The effect of the external magnetic field shows up in the last two terms.
21572,"Classically, the energy of the two of them together would be the sum of the two, and that works also quantum mechanically."
21573,"In a magnetic field, the energy of interaction due to the magnetic field is just the sum of the energy of interaction of the electron with the external field, and of the proton with the field—both expressed in terms of the sigma operators."
21574,"In quantum mechanics these terms are not really the energies, but thinking of the classical formulas for the energy is a way of remembering the rules for writing down the Hamiltonian."
21575,"Anyway, the correct Hamiltonian is Eq."
21576,(12.27).
21577,Now we have to go back to the beginning and do the problem all over again.
21578,"Much of the work is, however, done—we need only to add the effects of the new terms."
21579,The form of the equations is not different—only the coefficients.
21580,But they are just like the pair we had for the ammonia molecule.
21581,Looking back at Eq.
21582,So we have found the energies of the four stationary states of a hydrogen atom in a constant magnetic field.
21583,You see that we do.
21584,Even our labeling of the states agrees with what we called them before.
21585,"When we turn on the magnetic field though, all of the energies change in a different way."
21586,Let’s see how they go.
21587,12-3.
21588,The shift of the energy levels of an atom due to a magnetic field is called the Zeeman effect.
21589,We say that the curves in Fig.
21590,12-3 show the Zeeman splitting of the ground state of hydrogen.
21591,"When there is no magnetic field, we get just one spectral line from the hyperfine structure of hydrogen."
21592,There can be transitions between any two of the four states.
21593,"So if we have atoms in all four states, energy can be absorbed—or emitted—in any one of the six transitions shown by the vertical arrows in Fig."
21594,12-4.
21595,"Many of these transitions can be observed by the Rabi molecular beam technique we described in Volume II, Section 35-3."
21596,What makes the transitions go?
21597,It’s just as we saw for a varying electric field on the ammonia molecule.
21598,"Only here, it is the magnetic field which couples with the magnetic moments and does the trick."
21599,But the theory follows through in the same way that we worked it out for the ammonia.
21600,"When you put in this perturbing field as an additional term in the Hamiltonian, you get solutions in which the amplitudes vary with time—as we found for the ammonia molecule."
21601,So you can calculate easily and accurately the probability of a transition from one state to another.
21602,And you find that it all agrees with experiment.
21603,We would like now to discuss the shapes of the curves in Fig.
21604,12-3.
21605,"In the first place, the energies for large fields are easy to understand, and rather interesting."
21606,12-3.
21607,We can understand these energies physically in the following way.
21608,The nature of the stationary states in a zero field is determined completely by the interaction of the two magnetic moments.
21609,"In large external fields, however, the proton and electron will be influenced hardly at all by the field of the other; each will act as if it were alone in the external field."
21610,Then—as we have seen many times—the electron spin will be either parallel to or opposite to the external magnetic field.
21611,The proton can still be either way.
21612,"On the other hand, the proton can have its spin down."
21613,"When we used the analogies of (12.33) in our formulas of Chapter 9 to get the energies of the stationary states, we could also have taken the amplitudes that go with them."
21614,They come from Eq.
21615,We would also like to call your attention particularly to what happens at very low magnetic fields.
21616,12–5.
21617,If we put them through a Stern-Gerlach  experiment—with fields that are not too strong—we would find that they just go straight through.
21618,We would find three beams.
21619,So we are right back in Chapter 5.
21620,"(Remember, what we are saying is only strictly true for infinitesimal magnetic fields.)"
21621,So they would write our little table of states for zero field in (12.41) and (12.42) as shown in Table 12-3.
21622,"It’s not new physics, it’s all just a matter of notation."
21623,We would like now to use our knowledge of the hydrogen atom to do something special.
21624,Now we will show you one way they can be derived.
21625,In the hydrogen atom we have found a spin-one system which is made up of two spin one-half particles.
21626,We have already worked out in Chapter 6 how to transform the spin one-half amplitudes.
21627,We can use this information to calculate the transformation for spin one.
21628,His “up” and “down” states for the electron and proton would be different from ours.
21629,"But they are both just the transformation amplitudes for a spin one-half particle, so they are really identical numbers."
21630,"Now, however, we are about to get into trouble with notation."
21631,"We hope it won’t be too confusing, but for the moment at least, we will have to use some different symbols for the spin one-half amplitudes."
21632,"To help you keep things straight, we summarize the new notation in Table 12-4."
21633,"With our new notation, Eq."
21634,Now we will work through the general case for all the states.
21635,"In other words, Eq."
21636,We have now all of the amplitudes we wanted.
21637,The coefficients of Eqs.
21638,% ebook remove .
21639,"Well, it is a spin-zero system, so it has only one state—it is the same in all coordinate systems."
21640,We can check that everything works out by taking the difference of Eq.
21641,"You would, at first sight, think that a low-energy electron would have great difficulty passing through a solid crystal."
21642,"The atoms are packed together with their centers only a few angstroms apart, and the effective diameter of the atom for electron scattering is roughly an angstrom or so."
21643,"That is, the atoms are large, relative to their spacing, so that you would expect the mean free path between collisions to be of the order of a few angstroms—which is practically nothing."
21644,You would expect the electron to bump into one atom or another almost immediately.
21645,"Nevertheless, it is a ubiquitous phenomenon of nature that if the lattice is perfect, the electrons are able to travel through the crystal smoothly and easily—almost as if they were in a vacuum."
21646,This strange fact is what lets metals conduct electricity so easily; it has also permitted the development of many practical devices.
21647,"It is, for instance, what makes it possible for a transistor to imitate the radio tube."
21648,"In a radio tube electrons move freely through a vacuum, while in the transistor they move freely through a crystal lattice."
21649,The machinery behind the behavior of a transistor will be described in this chapter; the next one will describe the application of these principles in various practical devices.
21650,The conduction of electrons in a crystal is one example of a very common phenomenon.
21651,"Not only can electrons travel through crystals, but other “things” like atomic excitations can also travel in a similar manner."
21652,So the phenomenon which we want to discuss appears in many ways in the study of the physics of the solid state.
21653,You will remember that we have discussed many examples of two-state systems.
21654,"Let’s now think of an electron which can be in either one of two positions, in each of which it is in the same kind of environment."
21655,"Let’s also suppose that there is a certain amplitude to go from one position to the other, and, of course, the same amplitude to go back, just as we have discussed for the hydrogen molecular ion in Section 10–1."
21656,The laws of quantum mechanics then give the following results.
21657,There are two possible states of definite energy for the electron.
21658,Each state can be described by the amplitude for the electron to be in each of the two basic positions.
21659,"In either of the definite-energy states, the magnitudes of these two amplitudes are constant in time, and the phases vary in time with the same frequency."
21660,"On the other hand, if we start the electron in one position, it will later have moved to the other, and still later will swing back again to the first position."
21661,The amplitude is analogous to the motions of two coupled pendulums.
21662,Now consider a perfect crystal lattice in which we imagine that an electron can be situated in a kind of “pit” at one particular atom and with some particular energy.
21663,Suppose also that the electron has some amplitude to move into a different pit at one of the nearby atoms.
21664,It is something like the two-state system—but with an additional complication.
21665,"When the electron arrives at the neighboring atom, it can afterward move on to still another position as well as return to its starting point."
21666,"Now we have a situation analogous not to two coupled pendulums, but to an infinite number of pendulums all coupled together."
21667,It is something like what you see in one of those machines—made with a long row of bars mounted on a torsion wire—that is used in first-year physics to demonstrate wave propagation.
21668,"If you have a harmonic oscillator which is coupled to another harmonic oscillator, and that one to another, and so on …, and if you start an irregularity in one place, the irregularity will propagate as a wave along the line."
21669,The same situation exists if you place an electron at one atom of a long chain of atoms.
21670,"Usually, the simplest way of analyzing the mechanical problem is not to think in terms of what happens if a pulse is started at a definite place, but rather in terms of steady-wave solutions."
21671,"There exist certain patterns of displacements which propagate through the crystal as a wave of a single, fixed frequency."
21672,"Now the same thing happens with the electron—and for the same reason, because it’s described in quantum mechanics by similar equations."
21673,"You must appreciate one thing, however; the amplitude for the electron to be at a place is an amplitude, not a probability."
21674,"If the electron were simply leaking from one place to another, like water going through a hole, the behavior would be completely different."
21675,"For example, if we had two tanks of water connected by a tube to permit some leakage from one to the other, then the levels would approach each other exponentially."
21676,"But for the electron, what happens is amplitude leakage and not just a plain probability leakage."
21677,What happens then is quite different from the leakage between interconnected tanks.
21678,We want now to analyze quantitatively the quantum mechanical situation.
21679,Imagine a one-dimensional system made of a long line of atoms as shown in Fig.
21680,13–1(a).
21681,"(A crystal is, of course, three-dimensional but the physics is very much the same; once you understand the one-dimensional case you will be able to understand what happens in three dimensions.)"
21682,"Next, we want to see what happens if we put a single electron on this line of atoms."
21683,"Of course, in a real crystal there are already millions of electrons."
21684,But most of them (nearly all for an insulating crystal) take up positions in some pattern of motion each around its own atom—and everything is quite stationary.
21685,"However, we now want to think about what happens if we put an extra electron in."
21686,We will not consider what the other ones are doing because we suppose that to change their motion involves a lot of excitation energy.
21687,We are going to add an electron as if to produce one slightly bound negative ion.
21688,In watching what the one extra electron does we are making an approximation which disregards the mechanics of the inside workings of the atoms.
21689,"Of course the electron could then move to another atom, transferring the negative ion to another place."
21690,"We will suppose that just as in the case of an electron jumping between two protons, the electron can jump from one atom to the neighbor on either side with a certain amplitude."
21691,Now how do we describe such a system?
21692,What will be reasonable base states?
21693,"If you remember what we did when we had only two possible positions, you can guess how it will go."
21694,"Suppose that in our line of atoms the spacings are all equal; and that we number the atoms in sequence, as shown in Fig."
21695,13–1(a).
21696,"Next, we are going to suppose that when the electron is at one atom, there is a certain amplitude that it will leak to the atom on either side."
21697,"And we’ll take the simplest case for which it can only leak to the nearest neighbors—to get to the next-nearest neighbor, it has to go in two steps."
21698,Then Eq.
21699,What will the situation be at some later time?
21700,"Since we want to consider a crystal with a very large number of atoms, we’ll assume that there are an indefinitely large number of states—that the atoms go on forever in both directions."
21701,"(To do the finite case, we will have to pay special attention to what happens at the ends.)"
21702,"We could study many things about an electron in a lattice, but first let’s try to find the states of definite energy."
21703,As we have seen in earlier chapters this means that we have to find a situation in which the amplitudes all change at the same frequency if they change with time at all.
21704,All we have to do is take the determinant … but wait!
21705,"But if there are a large number—or an infinite number—of equations, the determinants are not very convenient."
21706,We’d better just try to solve the equations directly.
21707,We can rewrite Eq.
21708,(A differential equation relates the value of a function at a point to the values at infinitesimally nearby points.)
21709,Perhaps the methods we usually use for solving differential equations will also work here; let’s try.
21710,Linear differential equations with constant coefficients can always be solved in terms of exponential functions.
21711,"There are an infinite number of solutions—which is not surprising, since we started out with an infinite number of base states."
21712,Let’s see what these solutions mean.
21713,(13.10).
21714,(13.13).
21715,The amplitudes oscillate as we go along from one atom to the next.
21716,We can visualize what is going on by plotting a vertical line to show just the real part at each atom as we have done in Fig.
21717,13–2.
21718,"The envelope of these vertical lines (as shown by the broken-line curve) is, of course, a cosine curve."
21719,"And for any such state, the electron is equally likely to be found at every atom—there is no preference for one atom or the other."
21720,Only the phase is different for different atoms.
21721,"Also, as time goes on the phases vary."
21722,From Eq.
21723,"(13.10), was a real number."
21724,We can see now why that must be so if we have an infinite line of atoms.
21725,This kind of solution would be O.K.
21726,"if we were dealing with a line of atoms that ended, but cannot be a physical solution for an infinite chain of atoms."
21727,"It would give infinite amplitudes—and, therefore, infinite probabilities—which can’t represent a real situation."
21728,(13.13) is plotted in Fig.
21729,13–3.
21730,"The significant result is that any energy is possible within a certain range or “band” of energies, but no others."
21731,"According to our assumptions, if an electron in a crystal is in a stationary state, it can have no energy other than values in this band."
21732,According to Eq.
21733,13–3.
21734,We can see that in the following way.
21735,"But then, using Eq."
21736,It does not represent a different solution.
21737,13–4.
21738,The curves are just to help you see how things are going.)
21739,13–3.
21740,One side remark about something you can play with.
21741,It is not always a cosine wave—it’s not even necessarily symmetrical about some horizontal line.
21742,13–3 is at the zero of energy.
21743,In this section we would like to discuss the behavior of states in the one-dimensional lattice in more detail.
21744,For the stationary states described by Eq.
21745,How can we represent a situation which we would describe roughly by saying an electron of a certain energy is localized in a certain region—so that it is more likely to be found at one place than at some other place?
21746,We can do that by making a superposition of several solutions like Eq.
21747,I).
21748,Equation (13.16) then says that the energy of such an electron is proportional to the square of its velocity—it acts like a classical particle.
21749,"So long as we look at things on a scale gross enough that we don’t see the fine structure, our quantum mechanical picture begins to give results like classical physics."
21750,"In fact, if we solve Eq."
21751,The extra “energy of motion” of the electron in a packet depends on the velocity just as for a classical particle.
21752,We have now explained a remarkable mystery—how an electron in a crystal (like an extra electron put into germanium) can ride right through the crystal and flow perfectly freely even though it has to hit all the atoms.
21753,"It does so by having its amplitudes going pip-pip-pip from one atom to the next, working its way through the crystal."
21754,That is how a solid can conduct electricity.
21755,Let’s look for a moment at how we could apply the same ideas to see what happens to an electron in three dimensions.
21756,The results turn out to be very similar.
21757,"(If you want a cubic lattice, take the three spacings all equal.)"
21758,Now how should we describe the base states?
21759,"In fact, we can write Eq."
21760,(13.24).
21761,Expanding the cosines as we did before to get Eq.
21762,(13.16).
21763,"Following the arguments used there, we would conclude that an electron packet in three dimensions (made up by superposing many states with nearly equal energies) also moves like a classical particle with some effective mass."
21764,Then the “effective mass” of an electron localized in a small region depends on its direction of motion.
21765,(The details of such a situation are sometimes described in terms of an “effective mass tensor.”)
21766,According to Eq.
21767,"For the states we have described, we imagined base states in which an electron is placed on an atom of the crystal in some particular state, say the lowest energy state."
21768,"If you have an atom in empty space, and add an electron to make an ion, the ion can be formed in many ways."
21769,"The electron can go on in such a way as to make the state of lowest energy, or it can go on to make one or another of many possible “excited states” of the ion each with a definite energy above the lowest energy."
21770,The same thing can happen in a crystal.
21771,The whole analysis goes as before; we find a band of possible energies centered at a higher energy.
21772,"There can, in general, be many such bands each corresponding to a different level of excitation."
21773,There are also other possibilities.
21774,There may be some amplitude that the electron jumps from an excited condition at one atom to an unexcited condition at the next atom.
21775,(This is called an interaction between bands.)
21776,The mathematical theory gets more and more complicated as you take into account more and more bands and add more and more coefficients for leakage between the possible states.
21777,"No new ideas are involved, however; the equations are set up much as we have done in our simple example."
21778,"Generally they are very hard to calculate, so in practical cases very little is known theoretically about these parameters and for any particular real situation we can only take values determined experimentally."
21779,"There are other situations where the physics and mathematics are almost exactly like what we have found for an electron moving in a crystal, but in which the “object” that moves is quite different."
21780,"For instance, suppose that our original crystal—or rather linear lattice—was a line of neutral atoms, each with a loosely bound outer electron."
21781,Then imagine that we were to remove one electron.
21782,Which atom has lost its electron?
21783,"Again we will get the same formulas for the energy levels, for the “waves” of probability which move through the crystal with the group velocity of Eq."
21784,"(13.18), for the effective mass, and so on."
21785,Only now the waves describe the behavior of the missing electron—or “hole” as it is called.
21786,You can see that this particle will appear to have a positive charge.
21787,We’ll have some more to say about such holes in the next chapter.
21788,"As another example, we can think of a line of identical neutral atoms one of which has been put into an excited state—that is, with more than its normal ground state energy."
21789,It can interact with a neighboring atom by handing over to it the extra energy and returning to the ground state.
21790,You can see that it’s the same mathematics all over again.
21791,Now the object which moves is called an exciton.
21792,"It behaves like a neutral “particle” moving through the crystal, carrying the excitation energy."
21793,"Such motion may be involved in certain biological processes such as vision, or photosynthesis."
21794,"It has been guessed that the absorption of light in the retina produces an “exciton” which moves through some periodic structure (such as the layers in the rods we described in Chapter 36, Vol."
21795,I; see Fig.
21796,36–5) to be accumulated at some special station where the energy is used to induce a chemical reaction.
21797,We want now to consider the case of a single electron in a crystal which is not perfect.
21798,"Our earlier analysis says that perfect crystals have perfect conductivity—that electrons can go slipping through the crystal, as in a vacuum, without friction."
21799,One of the most important things that can stop an electron from going on forever is an imperfection or irregularity in the crystal.
21800,"As an example, suppose that somewhere in the crystal there is a missing atom; or suppose that someone put one wrong atom at one of the atomic sites so that things there are different than at the other atomic sites."
21801,How would we describe what happens then?
21802,What happens?
21803,When an electron arrives at atom “zero” there is some probability that the electron is scattered backwards.
21804,"If a wave packet is moving along and it reaches a place where things are a little bit different, some of it will continue onward and some of it will bounce back."
21805,"It’s quite difficult to analyze such a situation using a wave packet, because everything varies in time."
21806,It is much easier to work with steady-state solutions.
21807,"So we will work with stationary states, which we will find can be made up of continuous waves which have transmitted and reflected parts."
21808,"In three dimensions we would call the reflected part the scattered wave, since it would spread out in various directions."
21809,We start out with a set of equations which are just like the ones in Eq.
21810,They will look just like Eq.
21811,(13.6).
21812,Equation (13.10) would still work as a solution for all of the equations except the one for atom “zero”—it isn’t right for that one equation.
21813,We need a different solution which we can cook up in the following way.
21814,Now take a look at the set of equations for our new problem—the ones in (13.28) together with those for all the other atoms.
21815,"We want to consider the physical situation in which a wave is originally started only from the left, and there is only a “transmitted” wave that comes out beyond the scatterer—or impurity atom."
21816,(13.28) by the following trial solutions.
21817,13–6.
21818,By using the formulas in Eq.
21819,So we have found a complete solution.
21820,(13.30).
21821,"This is not always true, but happens to be so for a scattering at one atom only."
21822,"If there were a clump of impurity atoms, the amount added to the forward wave would not necessarily be the same as the reflected wave."
21823,You may be wondering how the transmitted wave can be “more” than the incident wave as it appears in Eq.
21824,(13.34).
21825,Such a solution cannot come out of what we have done so far.
21826,"We can get this solution, however, if we permit the trial solution we took in Eq."
21827,If we put these trial solutions into Eq.
21828,The remaining three equations in Eq.
21829,Notice that the amplitudes we have in Eq.
21830,(13.39) and (13.40) do not say that the trapped electron sits right on the impurity atom.
21831,The probability of finding the electron at nearby atoms is given by the square of these amplitudes.
21832,For one particular choice of the parameters it might vary as shown in the bar graph of Fig.
21833,13–7.
21834,The probability is greatest for finding the electron on the impurity atom.
21835,For nearby atoms the probability drops off exponentially with the distance from the impurity atom.
21836,This is another example of “barrier penetration.” From the point-of-view of classical physics the electron doesn’t have enough energy to get away from the energy “hole” at the trapping center.
21837,But quantum mechanically it can leak out a little way.
21838,"Finally, our example can be used to illustrate a point which is very useful these days in the physics of high-energy particles."
21839,It has to do with a relationship between scattering amplitudes and bound states.
21840,Suppose we have discovered—through experiment and theoretical analysis—the way that pions scatter from protons.
21841,Then a new particle is discovered and someone wonders whether maybe it is just a combination of a pion and a proton held together in some bound state (in an analogy to the way an electron is bound to a proton to make a hydrogen atom).
21842,By a bound state we mean a combination which has a lower energy than the two free-particles.
21843,There is a general theory which says that a bound state will exist at that energy at which the scattering amplitude becomes infinite if extrapolated algebraically (the mathematical term is “analytically continued”) to energy regions outside of the permitted band.
21844,The physical reason for this is as follows.
21845,"A bound state is a situation in which there are only waves tied on to a point and there’s no wave coming in to get it started, it just exists there by itself."
21846,The relative proportion between the so-called “scattered” or created wave and the wave being “sent in” is infinite.
21847,We can test this idea in our example.
21848,Let’s write our expression Eq.
21849,(13.43) for the trapped energy.
21850,What about the plus sign?
21851,This gives an energy above the allowed energy band.
21852,And indeed there is another bound state there which we missed when we solved the equations of Eq.
21853,(13.28).
21854,The relation between scattering and bound states provides one of the most useful clues in the current search for an understanding of the experimental observations about the new strange particles.
21855,One of the remarkable and dramatic developments in recent years has been the application of solid state science to technical developments in electrical devices such as transistors.
21856,The study of semiconductors led to the discovery of their useful properties and to a large number of practical applications.
21857,The field is changing so rapidly that what we tell you today may be incorrect next year.
21858,It will certainly be incomplete.
21859,And it is perfectly clear that with the continuing study of these materials many new and more wonderful things will be possible as time goes on.
21860,"You will not need to understand this chapter for what comes later in this volume, but you may find it interesting to see that at least something of what you are learning has some relation to the practical world."
21861,"There are large numbers of semiconductors known, but we’ll concentrate on those which now have the greatest technical application."
21862,"They are also the ones that are best understood, and in understanding them we will obtain a degree of understanding of many of the others."
21863,The semiconductor substances in most common use today are silicon and germanium.
21864,"These elements crystallize in the diamond lattice, a kind of cubic structure in which the atoms have tetrahedral bonding with their four nearest neighbors."
21865,They are insulators at very low temperatures—near absolute zero—although they do conduct electricity somewhat at room temperature.
21866,They are not metals; they are called semiconductors.
21867,"If we somehow put an extra electron into a crystal of silicon or germanium which is at a low temperature, we will have just the situation we described in the last chapter."
21868,The electron will be able to wander around in the crystal jumping from one atomic site to the next.
21869,"Actually, we have looked only at the behavior of electrons in a rectangular lattice, and the equations would be somewhat different for the real lattice of silicon or germanium."
21870,"All of the essential points are, however, illustrated by the results for the rectangular lattice."
21871,"As we saw in Chapter 13, these electrons can have energies only in a certain energy band—called the conduction band."
21872,"For energies near the bottom of the band, we can approximate Eq."
21873,14–1.
21874,"As we also mentioned in Chapter 13, we can have a similar situation if we remove an electron from a neutral insulator."
21875,"Then, an electron can jump over from a nearby atom and fill the “hole,” but leaving another “hole” at the atom it started from."
21876,"We can describe this behavior by writing an amplitude to find the hole at any particular atom, and by saying that the hole can jump from one atom to the next."
21877,"The mathematics is just the same for the hole as it was for the extra electron, and we get again that the energy of the hole is related to its wave number by an equation just like Eq."
21878,The hole has an energy related to the wave number of its probability amplitudes.
21879,"Its energy lies in a restricted band, and near the bottom of the band its energy varies quadratically with the wave number—or momentum—just as in Fig."
21880,14–1.
21881,"Following the arguments of Section 13–3, we would find that the hole also behaves like a classical particle with a certain effective mass—except that in noncubic crystals the mass depends on the direction of motion."
21882,So the hole behaves like a positive particle moving through the crystal.
21883,"The charge of the hole-particle is positive, because it is located at the site of a missing electron; and when it moves in one direction there are actually electrons moving in the opposite direction."
21884,"If we put several electrons into a neutral crystal, they will move around much like the atoms of a low-pressure gas."
21885,"If there are not too many, their interactions will not be very important."
21886,"If we then put an electric field across the crystal, the electrons will start to move and an electric current will flow."
21887,"Eventually they would all be drawn to one edge of the crystal, and, if there is a metal electrode there, they would be collected, leaving the crystal neutral."
21888,Similarly we could put many holes into a crystal.
21889,They would roam around at random unless there is an electric field.
21890,"With a field they would flow toward the negative terminal, and would be “collected”—what actually happens is that they are neutralized by electrons from the metal terminal."
21891,One can also have both holes and electrons together.
21892,"If there are not too many, they will all go their way independently."
21893,"With an electric field, they will all contribute to the current."
21894,"For obvious reasons, electrons are called the negative carriers and the holes are called the positive carriers."
21895,"We have so far considered that electrons are put into the crystal from the outside, or are removed to make a hole."
21896,It is also possible to “create” an electron-hole pair by taking a bound electron away from one neutral atom and putting it some distance away in the same crystal.
21897,"We then have a free electron and a free hole, and the two can move about as we have described."
21898,14–2.
21899,"The creation of pairs is a common process (as we will see later), so many people like to put Fig."
21900,14–2 and Fig.
21901,"14–3 together on the same graph—with the hole energy plotted downward, although it is, of course a positive energy."
21902,We have combined our two graphs in this way in Fig.
21903,14–4.
21904,14–4.
21905,Such a diagram—shown in Fig.
21906,14–5—just shows the possible energies for the electrons and holes.1
21907,How can electron-hole pairs be created?
21908,There are several ways.
21909,"For example, photons of light (or x-rays) can be absorbed and create a pair if the photon energy is above the energy of the gap."
21910,The rate at which pairs are produced is proportional to the light intensity.
21911,"If two electrodes are plated on a wafer of the crystal and a “bias” voltage is applied, the electrons and holes will be drawn to the electrodes."
21912,The circuit current will be proportional to the intensity of the light.
21913,This mechanism is responsible for the phenomenon of photoconductivity and the operation of photoconductive cells.
21914,Electron hole pairs can also be produced by high-energy particles.
21915,"When a fast-moving charged particle—for instance, a proton or a pion with an energy of tens or hundreds of MeV—goes through a crystal, its electric field will knock electrons out of their bound states creating electron-hole pairs."
21916,Such events occur hundreds of thousands of times per millimeter of track.
21917,"After the passage of the particle, the carriers can be collected and in doing so will give an electrical pulse."
21918,This is the mechanism at play in the semiconductor counters recently put to use for experiments in nuclear physics.
21919,"Such counters do not require semiconductors, they can also be made with crystalline insulators."
21920,"In fact, the first of such counters was made using a diamond crystal which is an insulator at room temperature."
21921,Very pure crystals are required if the holes and electrons are to be able to move freely to the electrodes without being trapped.
21922,The semiconductors silicon and germanium are used because they can be produced with high purity in reasonable large sizes (centimeter dimensions).
21923,So far we have been concerned with semiconductor crystals at temperatures near absolute zero.
21924,At any finite temperature there is still another mechanism by which electron-hole pairs can be created.
21925,The pair energy can be provided from the thermal energy of the crystal.
21926,The thermal vibrations of the crystal can transfer their energy to a pair—giving rise to “spontaneous” creation.
21927,I).
21928,"Near absolute zero there is no appreciable probability, but as the temperature rises there is an increasing probability of producing such pairs."
21929,At any finite temperature the production should continue forever at a constant rate giving more and more negative and positive carriers.
21930,Of course that does not happen because after a while the electrons and holes accidentally find each other—the electron drops into the hole and the excess energy is given to the lattice.
21931,We say that the electron and hole “annihilate.” There is a certain probability per second that a hole meets an electron and the two things annihilate each other.
21932,In equilibrium this rate must equal the rate that pairs are created.
21933,"A more complete theory—which includes more details about how holes and electrons “find” each other—shows that the “constant” is slightly dependent upon temperature, but the major dependence on temperature is in the exponential."
21934,"Let’s consider, as an example, a pure material which is originally neutral."
21935,The variation of many of the properties of a semiconductor—the conductivity for example—is mainly determined by the exponential factor because all the other factors vary much more slowly with temperature.
21936,So far we have talked about two ways that extra electrons can be put into an otherwise ideally perfect crystal lattice.
21937,"One way was to inject the electron from an outside source; the other way, was to knock a bound electron off a neutral atom creating simultaneously an electron and a hole."
21938,It is possible to put electrons into the conduction band of a crystal in still another way.
21939,Suppose we imagine a crystal of germanium in which one of the germanium atoms is replaced by an arsenic atom.
21940,"At room temperature the electron easily picks up that much energy from the thermal energy of the crystal, and then takes off on its own—moving about in the lattice as a free electron."
21941,An impurity atom such as the arsenic is called a donor site because it can give up a negative carrier to the crystal.
21942,"If a crystal of germanium is grown from a melt to which a very small amount of arsenic has been added, the arsenic donor sites will be distributed throughout the crystal and the crystal will have a certain density of negative carriers built in."
21943,You might think that these carriers would get swept away as soon as any small electric field was put across the crystal.
21944,"This will not happen, however, because the arsenic atoms in the body of the crystal each have a positive charge."
21945,"If the body of the crystal is to remain neutral, the average density of negative carrier electrons must be equal to the density of donor sites."
21946,"If you put two electrodes on the edges of such a crystal and connect them to a battery, a current will flow; but as the carrier electrons are swept out at one end, new conduction electrons must be introduced from the electrode on the other end so that the average density of conduction electrons is left very nearly equal to the density of donor sites."
21947,"Since the donor sites are positively charged, there will be some tendency for them to capture some of the conduction electrons as they diffuse around inside the crystal."
21948,"A donor site can, therefore, act as a trap such as those we discussed in the last section."
21949,But if the trapping energy is sufficiently small—as it is for arsenic—the number of carriers which are trapped at any one time is a small fraction of the total.
21950,For a complete understanding of the behavior of semiconductors one must take into account this trapping.
21951,"For the rest of our discussion, however, we will assume that the trapping energy is sufficiently low and the temperature is sufficiently high, that all of the donor sites have given up their electrons."
21952,"This is, of course, just an approximation."
21953,"Of course, when it steals the electron from a germanium atom, it leaves a hole there; and this hole can wander around in the crystal as a positive carrier."
21954,An impurity atom which can produce a hole in this way is called an acceptor because it “accepts” an electron.
21955,"If a germanium or a silicon crystal is grown from a melt to which a small amount of aluminum impurity has been added, the crystal will have built-in a certain density of holes which can act as positive carriers."
21956,"When a donor or an acceptor impurity is added to a semiconductor, we say that the material has been “doped.”"
21957,"When a germanium crystal with some built-in donor impurities is at room temperature, some conduction electrons are contributed by the thermally induced electron-hole pair creation as well as by the donor sites."
21958,"If the temperature is not too low, the number of negative carriers contributed by the donor impurity atoms is roughly equal to the number of impurity atoms present."
21959,In equilibrium Eq.
21960,"If an acceptor-type impurity is added to the crystal lattice, some of the new holes will drift around and annihilate some of the free electrons produced by thermal fluctuation."
21961,This process will go on until Eq.
21962,(14.4) is satisfied.
21963,"Under equilibrium conditions the number of positive carriers will be increased and the number of negative carriers will be decreased, leaving the product a constant."
21964,"If we put two electrodes on a piece of semiconductor crystal and connect them to a source of potential difference, there will be an electric field inside the crystal."
21965,"The electric field will cause the positive and the negative carriers to move, and an electric current will flow."
21966,For such material we can disregard the holes; they will contribute very little to the current because there are so few of them.
21967,In an ideal crystal the carriers would move across without any impediment.
21968,"In a real crystal at a finite temperature, however,—especially in a crystal with some impurities—the electrons do not move completely freely."
21969,"They are continually making collisions which knock them out of their original trajectories, that is, changing their momentum."
21970,These collisions are just exactly the scatterings we talked about in the last chapter and occur at any irregularity in the crystal lattice.
21971,"Since the conduction electrons have a very slightly different energy at the donor sites, the probability waves are scattered from that point."
21972,"Even in a perfectly pure crystal, however, there are (at any finite temperature) irregularities in the lattice due to thermal vibrations."
21973,"From the classical point of view we can say that the atoms aren’t lined up exactly on a regular lattice, but are, at any instant, slightly out of place due to their thermal vibrations."
21974,"At very high temperatures or for very pure materials this scattering may become important, but in most doped materials used in practical devices the impurity atoms contribute most of the scattering."
21975,We would like now to make an estimate of the electrical conductivity of such a material.
21976,This means that the carriers which are ordinarily moving about in a random fashion with their thermal energies will pick up an average drift velocity along the lines of the electric field and give rise to a current through the crystal.
21977,The drift velocity is in general rather small compared with the typical thermal velocities so that we can estimate the current by assuming that the average time that the carrier travels between scatterings is a constant.
21978,We should use the effective mass we calculated in the last chapter but since we want to make a rough calculation we will suppose that this effective mass is the same in all directions.
21979,(14.7).
21980,"If there are comparable numbers of both negative and positive carriers present at the same time, we must add the contributions from each kind of carrier."
21981,"They will be smaller than in a doped material, so the conductivity will be less."
21982,"It is certainly a peculiar thing that in a substance where the only relatively free objects are electrons, there should be an electrical current carried by holes that behave like positive particles."
21983,"We would like, therefore, to describe an experiment that shows in a rather clear way that the sign of the carrier of electric current is quite definitely positive."
21984,"Suppose we have a block made of semiconductor material—it could also be a metal—and we put an electric field on it so as to draw a current in some direction, say the horizontal direction as drawn in Fig."
21985,14–6.
21986,"Now suppose we put a magnetic field on the block pointing at a right angle to the current, say into the plane of the figure."
21987,And since the average drift velocity is either right or left—depending on the sign of the charge on the carrier—the average magnetic force on the carriers will be either up or down.
21988,"No, that is not right!"
21989,For the directions we have assumed for the current and the magnetic field the magnetic force on the moving charges will always be up.
21990,"If the current is carried by negative charges, they will be moving left (for the same sign of the conduction current) and they will also feel an upward force."
21991,"Under steady conditions, however, there is no upward motion of the carriers because the current can flow only from left to right."
21992,"What happens is that a few of the charges initially flow upward, producing a surface charge density along the upper surface of semiconductor—leaving an equal and opposite surface charge density along the bottom surface of the crystal."
21993,The charges pile up on the top and bottom surfaces until the electric forces they produce on the moving charges just exactly cancel the magnetic force (on the average) so that the steady current flows horizontally.
21994,"The charges on the top and bottom surfaces will produce a potential difference vertically across the crystal which can be measured with a high-resistance voltmeter, as shown in Fig."
21995,14–7.
21996,The sign of the potential difference registered by the voltmeter will depend on the sign of the carrier charges responsible for the current.
21997,When such experiments were first done it was expected that the sign of the potential difference would be negative as one would expect for negative conduction electrons.
21998,"People were, therefore, quite surprised to find that for some materials the sign of the potential difference was in the opposite direction."
21999,It appeared that the current carrier was a particle with a positive charge.
22000,The original discovery of the anomalous sign of the potential difference in the Hall effect was made in a metal rather than a semiconductor.
22001,"It had been assumed that in metals the conduction was always by electron; however, it was found out that for beryllium the potential difference had the wrong sign."
22002,"It is now understood that in metals as well as in semiconductors it is possible, in certain circumstances, that the “objects” responsible for the conduction are holes."
22003,"Although it is ultimately the electrons in the crystal which do the moving, nevertheless, the relationship of the momentum and the energy, and the response to external fields is exactly what one would expect for an electric current carried by positive particles."
22004,Let’s see if we can make a quantitative estimate of the magnitude of the voltage difference expected from the Hall effect.
22005,If the voltmeter in Fig.
22006,The Hall coefficient depends just on the density of carriers—provided that carriers of one sign are in a large majority.
22007,"Measurement of the Hall effect is, therefore, one convenient way of determining experimentally the density of carriers in a semiconductor."
22008,14–8.
22009,"Actually, it is not practical to put together two separate pieces of crystal and have them in uniform contact on an atomic scale."
22010,"Instead, junctions are made out of a single crystal which has been modified in the two separate regions."
22011,One way is to add some suitable doping impurity to the “melt” after only half of the crystal has grown.
22012,Another way is to paint a little of the impurity element on the surface and then heat the crystal causing some impurity atoms to diffuse into the body of the crystal.
22013,For our discussions we will imagine an ideal situation in which these two regions of the crystal with different properties meet at a sharp boundary.
22014,"Actually, that describes the situation before we put the two materials in contact."
22015,Once they are connected together the situation will change near the boundary.
22016,When they do this they leave behind an excess of negative charge.
22017,Under equilibrium conditions the net diffusion current must be zero.
22018,14–9(b).
22019,Notice that if Eqs.
22020,"We have seen earlier, however, that this product depends only on the temperature and the gap energy of the crystal."
22021,"Provided both sides of the crystal are at the same temperature, the two equations are consistent with the same value of the potential difference."
22022,"Since there is a potential difference from one side of the junction to the other, it looks something like a battery."
22023,That would be nice because then the current would flow forever without using up any material and we would have an infinite source of energy in violation of the second law of thermodynamics!
22024,And the reason is easy to see.
22025,Suppose we imagine first a wire made out of a piece of undoped material.
22026,There will be a potential difference across this junction.
22027,At all the junctions the potential differences adjust themselves so that there is no net current flow in the circuit.
22028,"It does turn out, however—if you work out the details—that if some of the junctions are at a different temperature than the other junctions, currents will flow."
22029,Some of the junctions will be heated and others will be cooled by this current and thermal energy will be converted into electrical energy.
22030,"This effect is responsible for the operation of thermocouples which are used for measuring temperatures, and of thermoelectric generators."
22031,The same effect is also used to make small refrigerators.
22032,14–9 really exists?
22033,One way is to shine light on the junction.
22034,When the light photons are absorbed they can produce an electron-hole pair.
22035,In the strong electric field that exists at the junction (equal to the slope of the potential curve of Fig.
22036,"If the two sides of the junction are now connected to an external circuit, these extra charges will provide a current."
22037,The energy of the light will be converted into electrical energy in the junction.
22038,The solar cells which generate electrical power for the operation of some of our satellites operate on this principle.
22039,In our discussion of the operation of a semiconductor junction we have been assuming that the holes and the electrons act more-or-less independently—except that they somehow get into proper statistical equilibrium.
22040,"When we were describing the current produced by light shining on the junction, we were assuming that an electron or a hole produced in the junction region would get into the main body of the crystal before being annihilated by a carrier of the opposite polarity."
22041,"In the immediate vicinity of the junction, where the density of carriers of both signs is approximately equal, the effect of electron-hole annihilation (or as it is often called, “recombination”) is an important effect, and in a detailed analysis of a semiconductor junction must be properly taken into account."
22042,We have been assuming that a hole or an electron produced in a junction region has a good chance of getting into the main body of the crystal before recombining.
22043,"Most of the pairs will, therefore, contribute to an external current."
22044,"If we put a voltage across the junction, a large current will flow if the polarity is in one direction, but a very small current will flow if the same voltage is applied in the opposite direction."
22045,"If an alternating voltage is applied across the junction, a net current will flow in one direction—the current is “rectified.” Let’s look again at what is going on in the equilibrium condition described by the graphs of Fig."
22046,14–9.
22047,These carriers are diffusing around and a certain number of them each second approach the junction.
22048,There is also a current of positive carriers approaching the junction from the other side.
22049,Under equilibrium the currents from the two directions are equal.
22050,(14.10).
22051,We have just derived it in a different way.
22052,(14.14) is zero.
22053,"Since the total current is the sum of the currents contributed by the two carriers, Eq."
22054,The voltage-current characteristic of Eq.
22055,(14.14) is shown in Fig.
22056,14–10.
22057,It shows the typical behavior of solid state diodes—such as those used in modern computers.
22058,We should remark that Eq.
22059,(14.14) is true only for small voltages.
22060,"You may remember, incidentally, that we got exactly the same equation we have found here in Eq."
22061,(14.14) when we discussed the “mechanical rectifier”—the ratchet and pawl—in Chapter 46 of Volume I.
22062,We get the same equations in the two situations because the basic physical processes are quite similar.
22063,Perhaps the most important application of semiconductors is in the transistor.
22064,The transistor consists of two semiconductor junctions very close together.
22065,Its operation is based in part on the same principles that we just described for the semiconductor diode—the rectifying junction.
22066,14–11(a).
22067,Each of the two junctions in the transistor will behave much in the way we have described in the last section.
22068,14–11(b).
22069,Now let’s imagine that we connect each of the three regions to external voltage sources as shown in part (a) of Fig.
22070,14–12.
22071,We will call this terminal the emitter.
22072,Under these circumstances the variation of potential across the crystal will be as shown in the graph of Fig.
22073,14–12(b).
22074,"Since the emitter is at a relatively more positive potential than the base, a current of positive carriers will flow from the emitter region into the base region."
22075,"A relatively large current flows, since we have a junction operating with a “forward voltage”—corresponding to the right-hand half of the graph in Fig."
22076,14–10.
22077,"Now, however, comes the secret of the transistor."
22078,"In a typical transistor, all but a fraction of a percent of the hole current which leaves the emitter and enters the base is collected in the collector region, and only the small remainder contributes to the net base current."
22079,"The sum of the base and collector currents is, of course, equal to the emitter current."
22080,Since we are on a relatively steep part of the curve of Fig.
22081,What about the electrons—the negative carriers that we have been neglecting so far?
22082,"First, note that we do not expect any significant electron current to flow between the base and the collector."
22083,"With a large negative voltage on the collector, the electrons in the base would have to climb a very high potential energy hill and the probability of doing that is very small."
22084,There is a very small current of electrons to the collector.
22085,"On the other hand, the electrons in the base can go into the emitter region."
22086,"In fact, you might expect the electron current in this direction to be comparable to the hole current from the emitter into the base."
22087,"Such an electron current isn’t useful, and, on the contrary, is bad because it increases the total base current required for a given current of holes to the collector."
22088,"The transistor is, therefore, designed to minimize the electron current to the emitter."
22089,"(The very thin base region also helps a great deal because the sweeping out of the holes in this region by the collector increases significantly the average hole current from the emitter into the base, while leaving the electron current unchanged.)"
22090,"The currents are dominated by motion of the holes, and the transistor performs as an amplifier as we have described above."
22091,14–11.
22092,"In Chapter 13 we worked out the theory for the propagation of an electron or of some other “particle,” such as an atomic excitation, through a crystal lattice."
22093,In the last chapter we applied the theory to semiconductors.
22094,But when we talked about situations in which there are many electrons we disregarded any interactions between them.
22095,To do this is of course only an approximation.
22096,In this chapter we will discuss further the idea that you can disregard the interaction between the electrons.
22097,We will also use the opportunity to show you some more applications of the theory of the propagation of particles.
22098,"Since we will generally continue to disregard the interactions between particles, there is very little really new in this chapter except for the new applications."
22099,"The first example to be considered is, however, one in which it is possible to write down quite exactly the correct equations when there is more than one “particle” present."
22100,From them we will be able to see how the approximation of disregarding the interactions is made.
22101,"We will not, though, analyze the problem very carefully."
22102,As our first example we will consider a “spin wave” in a ferromagnetic crystal.
22103,We have discussed the theory of ferromagnetism in Chapter 36 of Volume II.
22104,At zero temperature all the electron spins that contribute to the magnetism in the body of a ferromagnetic crystal are parallel.
22105,"There is an interaction energy between the spins, which is lowest when all the spins are down."
22106,"At any nonzero temperature, however, there is some chance that some of the spins are turned over."
22107,We calculated the probability in an approximate manner in Chapter 36.
22108,This time we will describe the quantum mechanical theory—so you will see what you would have to do if you wanted to solve the problem more exactly.
22109,(We will still make some idealizations by assuming that the electrons are localized at the atoms and that the spins interact only with neighboring spins.)
22110,"Further, we imagine that these electrons are localized at the atomic sites in the lattice."
22111,The model corresponds roughly to metallic nickel.
22112,We have already discussed this kind of interaction energy when we considered the hyperfine splitting of hydrogen due to the interaction of the magnetic moments of the electron and proton in a hydrogen atom.
22113,"We have a term for each such pair, and the Hamiltonian is (as you would expect for classical energies) the sum of these terms for each interacting pair."
22114,"In a real crystal, there may be other terms which are the interactions of next nearest neighbors, and so on, but we don’t need to consider such complications at this stage."
22115,With the Hamiltonian of Eq.
22116,(15.1) we have a complete description of the ferromagnet—within our approximation—and the properties of the magnetization should come out.
22117,We should also be able to calculate the thermodynamic properties due to the magnetization.
22118,This problem has never been completely solved.
22119,We will show some of the problems by taking a simple example in which all the atoms are in a line—a one-dimensional lattice.
22120,You can easily extend the ideas to three dimensions.
22121,"At each atomic location there is an electron which has two possible states, either spin up or spin down, and the whole system is described by telling how all of the spins are arranged."
22122,We take the Hamiltonian of the system to be the operator of the interaction energy.
22123,Interpreting the spin vectors of Eq.
22124,Now what is the lowest state of this system?
22125,It’s easy to figure out the energy for this state.
22126,"We can, however, also use a good short cut."
22127,"For the ground state all spins are up; so if you exchange a particular pair of spins, you get back the original state."
22128,The ground state is a stationary state.
22129,Next we would like to look at the energies of some of the excited states.
22130,"It will be convenient to measure the energies with respect to the ground state—that is, to choose the ground state as our zero of energy."
22131,For describing states other than the ground state we will need a suitable set of base states.
22132,"One convenient approach is to group the states according to whether one electron has spin down, or two electrons have spin down, and so on."
22133,"There are, of course, many states with one spin down."
22134,"The down spin could be at atom “4,” or at atom “5,” or at atom “6,” … We can, in fact, choose just such states for our base states."
22135,15–1).
22136,That just means that there is a certain amplitude to have the down spin jump over to the next atom.
22137,"So because of the interaction between the spins, if we begin with one spin down, then there is some probability that at a later time another one will be down instead."
22138,The Hamiltonian will never mix these states with others that have more spins down.
22139,So long as you only exchange spins you never change the total number of down spins.
22140,Now what are the energy levels for states with one spin down?
22141,(15.8) for the matrix elements.
22142, The definite energy solutions correspond to “waves” of down spin—called “spin waves.” And for each wavelength there is a corresponding energy.
22143,Now we would like to discuss what happens if there are two down spins.
22144,Again we pick a set of base states.
22145,"We’ll choose states in which there are down spins at two atomic locations, such as the state shown in Fig."
22146,15–2.
22147,The complications which now arise are not complications of ideas—they are merely complexities in bookkeeping.
22148,(One of the complexities of quantum mechanics is just the bookkeeping.
22149,"With more and more down spins, the notation becomes more and more elaborate with lots of indices and the equations always look very horrifying; but the ideas are not necessarily more complicated than in the simplest case.)"
22150,It is not hard to figure out.
22151,These effects should all be equal.
22152,This equation is correct except in two situations.
22153,(15.16) should be missing.
22154,We are going to disregard these exceptions.
22155,We simply ignore the fact that some few of these equations are slightly altered.
22156,"After all, the crystal is supposed to be infinite, and we have an infinite number of terms; neglecting a few might not matter much."
22157,So for a first rough approximation let’s forget about the altered equations.
22158,"In other words, we assume that Eq."
22159,This is the essential part of our approximation.
22160,Then the solution is not hard to find.
22161,"There are two particles—that is, two spin waves."
22162,The two particles act completely independently.
22163,That’s all there is to it.
22164,"Of course we have made some approximations, but we do not wish to discuss the precision of our answer at this point."
22165,"However, you might guess that in a reasonable size crystal with billions of atoms—and, therefore, billions of terms in the Hamiltonian—leaving out a few terms wouldn’t make much of an error."
22166,"If we had so many down spins that there was an appreciable density, then we would certainly have to worry about the corrections."
22167,"[Interestingly enough, an exact solution can be written down if there are just the two down spins."
22168,The result is not particularly important.
22169,But it is interesting that the equations can be solved exactly for this case.
22170,It describes the fact that when the spins come together there is a certain chance of scattering.
22171,The spins act very much like particles with an interaction.
22172,But the detailed theory of their scattering goes beyond what we want to talk about here.]
22173,"In the last section we wrote down a Hamiltonian, Eq."
22174,"(15.15), for a two-particle system."
22175,"Then using an approximation which is equivalent to neglecting any “interaction” of the two particles, we found the stationary states described by Eqs."
22176,(15.17) and (15.18).
22177,This state is just the product of two single-particle states.
22178,"(15.18) is, however, really not satisfactory."
22179,The trouble is that we have not forced our solution of Eq.
22180,(15.15) to satisfy this additional condition.
22181,Fortunately it is easy to fix things up.
22182,"Any linear combination of (15.18) and (15.23) is also a good solution, and has an energy still given by Eq."
22183,(15.19).
22184,Our interpretation of Eq.
22185,(15.24) in terms of “magnons” must also be different.
22186,The amplitude (15.24) represents one state with two particles (magnons).
22187,"By now, this discussion should remind you of Chapter 4 and our story of identical particles."
22188,We have just been showing that the particles of the spin waves—the magnons—behave like identical Bose particles.
22189,"All amplitudes must be symmetric in the coordinates of the two particles—which is the same as saying that if we “interchange the two particles,” we get back the same amplitude and with the same sign."
22190,"But, you may be thinking, why did we choose to add the two terms in making Eq."
22191,(15.24).
22192,Why not subtract?
22193,The magnons will behave like Bose particles.2
22194,"The main points of this discussion have been twofold: First, to show you something about spin waves, and, second, to demonstrate a state whose amplitude is a product of two amplitudes, and whose energy is the sum of the energies corresponding to the two amplitudes."
22195,For independent particles the amplitude is the product and the energy is the sum.
22196,You can easily see why the energy is the sum.
22197,The energy corresponding to the amplitude product is the sum of the two energies.
22198,We have gone through a rather long-winded argument to tell you a simple thing.
22199,"When you don’t take into account any interaction between particles, you can think of each particle independently."
22200,"They can individually exist in the various different states they would have alone, and they will each contribute the energy they would have had if they were alone."
22201,"However, you must remember that if they are identical particles, they may behave either as Bose or as Fermi particles depending upon the problem."
22202,"Two extra electrons added to a crystal, for instance, would have to behave like Fermi particles."
22203,"When the positions of two electrons are interchanged, the amplitude must reverse sign."
22204,In the equation corresponding to Eq.
22205,(15.24) there would have to be a minus sign between the two terms on the right.
22206,The amplitude for this state is zero.
22207,"Although quantum mechanics provides the basic laws that determine the structures of molecules, these laws can be applied exactly only to the most simple compounds."
22208,"The chemists have, therefore, worked out various approximate methods for calculating some of the properties of complicated molecules."
22209,We would now like to show you how the independent particle approximation is used by the organic chemists.
22210,We begin with the benzene molecule.
22211,We discussed the benzene molecule from another point of view in Chapter 10.
22212,"There we took an approximate picture of the molecule as a two-state system, with the two base states shown in Fig."
22213,15–3.
22214,There is a ring of six carbons with a hydrogen bonded to the carbon at each location.
22215,"With the conventional picture of valence bonds it is necessary to assume double bonds between half of the carbon atoms, and in the lowest energy condition there are the two possibilities shown in the figure."
22216,"There are also other, higher-energy states."
22217,"When we discussed benzene in Chapter 10, we just took the two states and forgot all the rest."
22218,"We found that the ground-state energy of the molecule was not the energy of one of the states in the figure, but was lower than that by an amount proportional to the amplitude to flip from one of these states to the other."
22219,Now we’re going to look at the same molecule from a completely different point of view—using a different kind of approximation.
22220,"The two points of view will give us different answers, but if we improve either approximation it should lead to the truth, a valid description of benzene."
22221,"However, if we don’t bother to improve them, which is of course the usual situation, then you should not be surprised if the two descriptions do not agree exactly."
22222,We shall at least show that also with the new point-of-view the lowest energy of the benzene molecule is lower than either of the three-bond structures of Fig.
22223,15–3.
22224,Now we want to use the following picture.
22225,Suppose we imagine the six carbon atoms of a benzene molecule connected only by single bonds as in Fig.
22226,15–4.
22227,We have removed six electrons—since a bond stands for a pair of electrons—so we have a six-times ionized benzene molecule.
22228,"Now we will consider what happens when we put back the six electrons one at a time, imagining that each one can run freely around the ring."
22229,We assume also that all the bonds shown in Fig.
22230,"15–4 are satisfied, and don’t need to be considered further."
22231,What happens when we put one electron back into the molecular ion?
22232,"It might, of course, be located in any one of the six positions around the ring—corresponding to six base states."
22233,"If we analyze the stationary states, there would be certain possible energy levels."
22234,That’s only for one electron.
22235,Next put a second electron in.
22236,And now we make the most ridiculous approximation that you can think of—that what one electron does is not affected by what the other is doing.
22237,"Of course they really will interact; they repel each other through the Coulomb force, and furthermore when they are both at the same site, they must have considerably different energy than twice the energy for one being there."
22238,Certainly the approximation of independent particles is not legitimate when there are only six sites—particularly when we want to put in six electrons.
22239,Nevertheless the organic chemists have been able to learn a lot by making this kind of an approximation.
22240,"Before we work out the benzene molecule in detail, let’s consider a simpler example—the ethylene molecule which contains just two carbon atoms with two hydrogen atoms on either side as shown in Fig."
22241,15–5.
22242,This molecule has one “extra” bond involving two electrons between the two carbon atoms.
22243,Now remove one of these electrons; what do we have?
22244,We can look at it as a two-state system—the remaining electron can be at one carbon or the other.
22245,We can analyze it as a two-state system.
22246,15–6.
22247,Now add the second electron.
22248,"Good, if we have two electrons, we can put the first one in the lower state and the second one in the upper."
22249,Not quite; we forgot something.
22250,Each one of the states is really double.
22251,"Two electrons can go into the same state if one has its spin up and the other, its spin down."
22252,(No more can be put in because of the exclusion principle.)
22253,"We can draw a diagram, as in Fig."
22254,"15–7, which indicates both the energy levels and their occupancy."
22255,In the condition of lowest energy both electrons will be in the lowest state with their spins opposite.
22256,Let’s go back to the benzene.
22257,Each of the two states of Fig.
22258,15–3 has three double bonds.
22259,"But when we studied benzene before, we got that the energy was lower than the energy of the structure with three extra bonds."
22260,Let’s see if the energy for benzene comes out lower than three bonds from our new point of view.
22261,We start with the six-times ionized benzene ring and add one electron.
22262,Now we have a six-state system.
22263,"We haven’t solved such a system yet, but we know what to do."
22264,"We can write six equations in the six amplitudes, and so on."
22265,"But let’s save some work—by noticing that we’ve already solved the problem, when we worked out the problem of an electron on an infinite line of atoms."
22266,In other words we can take the solution for an infinite line with an added requirement that the solution must be periodic with a cycle six atoms long.
22267,We have a line spectrum of possible energy levels.
22268,15–8(b).
22269,(The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of different states with the same energy.)
22270,"There’s a nice way to visualize the six energy levels, as we have shown in part (a) of the figure."
22271,(15.25).
22272,The six points represent the six possible states.
22273,"If we have more than one electron, two—with opposite spins—can go into each state."
22274,For the benzene molecule we have to put in six electrons.
22275,We can use this description to calculate or understand other properties of benzene.
22276,"For example, using Fig."
22277,15–8 we can discuss the excitation of benzene by light.
22278,What would happen if we tried to excite one of the electrons?
22279,It could move up to one of the empty higher states.
22280,The lowest energy of excitation would be a transition from the highest filled level to the lowest empty level.
22281,What the chemist does in situations like this is to analyze many molecules of a similar kind and get some empirical rules.
22282,You may feel that this sounds a little absurd.
22283,It is not very satisfactory from the point of view of a physicist who is trying to understand nature from first principles.
22284,But the problem of the chemist is different.
22285,"He must try to guess ahead of time what is going to happen with molecules that haven’t been made yet, or which aren’t understood completely."
22286,What he needs is a series of empirical rules; it doesn’t make much difference where they come from.
22287,So he uses the theory in quite a different way than the physicist.
22288,"He takes equations that have some shadow of the truth in them, but then he must alter the constants in them—making empirical corrections."
22289,"In the case of benzene, the principal reason for the inconsistency is our assumption that the electrons are independent—the theory we started with is really not legitimate."
22290,"Nevertheless, it has some shadow of the truth because its results seem to be going in the right direction."
22291,With such equations plus some empirical rules—including various exceptions—the organic chemist makes his way through the morass of complicated things he chooses to study.
22292,(Don’t forget that the reason a physicist can really calculate from first principles is that he chooses only simple problems.
22293,"So far, he has been able to calculate reasonably accurately only the hydrogen atom and the helium atom.)"
22294,Let’s see how the same ideas can be used to study other molecules.
22295,15–9 according to the usual valence bond picture.
22296,We can play the same game with the extra four electrons corresponding to the two double bonds.
22297,"If we remove four electrons, we have four carbon atoms in a line."
22298,You already know how to solve a line.
22299,"You say, “Oh no, I only know how to solve an infinite line.” But the solutions for the infinite line also include the ones for a finite line."
22300,Watch.
22301,15–10.
22302,And the same is true of any superposition of these two solutions.
22303,We can represent the energy levels using a circle diagram similar to the one for benzene.
22304,This time we use a semicircle divided into five equal parts as shown in Fig.
22305,15–11.
22306,"There are four stationary states, which is what we expect having started with four base states."
22307,"(Ah, what wonders mathematics holds; the golden mean of the Greeks5  gives us the lowest energy state of the butadiene molecule according to this theory!)"
22308,Now we can calculate the energy of the butadiene molecule when we put in four electrons.
22309,"With four electrons, we fill up the lowest two levels, each with two electrons of opposite spin."
22310,"The energy is a little lower than for two simple double bonds, but the binding is not so strong as in benzene."
22311,Anyway this is the way the chemist analyzes some organic molecules.
22312,The chemist can use not only the energies but the probability amplitudes as well.
22313,"Knowing the amplitudes for each state, and which states are occupied, he can tell the probability of finding an electron anywhere in the molecule."
22314,Those places where the electrons are more likely to be are apt to be reactive in chemical substitutions which require that an electron be shared with some other group of atoms.
22315,The other sites are more likely to be reactive in those substitutions which have a tendency to yield an extra electron to the system.
22316,"The same ideas we have been using can give us some understanding of a molecule even as complicated as chlorophyll, one version of which is shown in Fig."
22317,15–12.
22318,Notice that the double and single bonds we have drawn with heavy lines form a long closed ring with twenty intervals.
22319,The extra electrons of the double bonds can run around this ring.
22320,Using the independent particle method we can get a whole set of energy levels.
22321,"There are strong absorption lines from transitions between these levels which lie in the visible part of the spectrum, and give this molecule its strong color."
22322,"Similar complicated molecules such as the xanthophylls, which make leaves turn red, can be studied in the same way."
22323,There is one more idea which emerges from the application of this kind of theory in organic chemistry.
22324,"It is probably the most successful or, at least in a certain sense, the most accurate."
22325,This idea has to do with the question: In what situations does one get a particularly strong chemical binding?
22326,The answer is very interesting.
22327,"Take the example, first, of benzene, and imagine the sequence of events that occurs as we start with the six-times ionized molecule and add more and more electrons."
22328,We would then be thinking of various benzene ions—negative or positive.
22329,Suppose we plot the energy of the ion (or neutral molecule) as a function of the number of electrons.
22330,15–13.
22331,For the first two electrons the slope of the function is a straight line.
22332,"For each successive group the slope increases, and there is a discontinuity in slope between the groups of electrons."
22333,The slope changes when one has just finished filling a set of levels which all have the same energy and must move up to the next higher set of levels for the next electron.
22334,The actual energy of the benzene ion is really quite different from the curve of Fig.
22335,15–13 because of the interactions of the electrons and because of electrostatic energies we have been neglecting.
22336,Now consider a very smooth curve that fits the points on the average like the one drawn in Fig.
22337,15–14.
22338,"We can say that the points above this curve have “higher-than-normal” energies, and the points below the curve have “lower-than-normal” energies."
22339,"We would, in general, expect that those configurations with a lower-than-normal energy would have an above average stability—chemically speaking."
22340,"Notice that the configurations farther below the curve always occur at the end of one of the straight line segments—namely when there are enough electrons to fill up an “energy shell,” as it is called."
22341,This is the very accurate prediction of the theory.
22342,Molecules—or ions—are particularly stable (in comparison with other similar configurations) when the available electrons just fill up an energy shell.
22343,This theory has explained and predicted some very peculiar chemical facts.
22344,"To take a very simple example, consider a ring of three."
22345,"It’s almost unbelievable that the chemist can make a ring of three and have it stable, but it has been done."
22346,The energy circle for three electrons is shown in Fig.
22347,15–15.
22348,"Now if you put two electrons in the lower state, you have only two of the three electrons that you require."
22349,The third electron must be put in at a much higher level.
22350,"By our argument this molecule should not be particularly stable, whereas the two-electron structure should be stable."
22351,"It does turn out, in fact, that the neutral molecule of triphenyl cyclopropenyl is very hard to make, but that the positive ion shown in Fig."
22352,15–16 is relatively easy to make.
22353,The ring of three is never really easy because there is always a large stress when the bonds in an organic molecule make an equilateral triangle.
22354,"To make a stable compound at all, the structure must be stabilized in some way."
22355,"Anyway if you add three benzene rings on the corners, the positive ion can be made."
22356,(The reason for this requirement of added benzene rings is not really understood.)
22357,In a similar way the five-sided ring can also be analyzed.
22358,"If you draw the energy diagram, you can see in a qualitative way that the six-electron structure should be an especially stable structure, so that such a molecule should be most stable as a negative ion."
22359,Now the five-ring is well known and easy to make and always acts as a negative ion.
22360,There are two other similar situations which we will describe only briefly.
22361,"In considering the structure of an atom, we can consider that the electrons fill successive shells."
22362,The Schrödinger theory of electron motion can be worked out easily only for a single electron moving in a “central” field—one which varies only with the distance from a point.
22363,One way is to use a kind of independent particle approximation.
22364,First you calculate what happens with one electron.
22365,You get a number of energy levels.
22366,You put an electron into the lowest energy state.
22367,"You can, for a rough model, continue to ignore the electron interactions and go on filling successive shells, but there is a way to get better answers by taking into account—in an approximate way at least—the effect of the electric charge carried by the electron."
22368,"Each time you add an electron you compute its amplitude to be at various places, and then use this amplitude to estimate a kind of spherically symmetric charge distribution."
22369,You use the field of this distribution—together with the field of the positive nucleus and all the previous electrons—to calculate the states available for the next electron.
22370,In this way you can get reasonably correct estimates for the energies for the neutral atom and for various ionized states.
22371,"You find that there are energy shells, just as we saw for the electrons in a ring molecule."
22372,"With a partially filled shell, the atom will show a preference for taking on one or more extra electrons, or for losing some electrons so as to get into the most stable state of a filled shell."
22373,This theory explains the machinery behind the fundamental chemical properties which show up in the periodic table of the elements.
22374,"The inert gases are those elements in which a shell has just been completed, and it is especially difficult to make them react."
22375,"(Some of them do react of course—with fluorine and oxygen, for example; but such compounds are very weakly bound; the so-called inert gases are nearly inert.)"
22376,The other situation is found in nuclear physics.
22377,In atomic nuclei the protons and neutrons interact with each other quite strongly.
22378,"Even so, the independent particle model can again be used to analyze nuclear structure."
22379,Nuclei containing protons in these numbers are also especially stable.
22380,Since there was initially no explanation for these numbers they were called the “magic numbers” of nuclear physics.
22381,"It is well known that neutrons and protons interact strongly with each other; people were, therefore, quite surprised when it was discovered that an independent particle model predicted a shell structure which came out with the first few magic numbers."
22382,The model assumed that each nucleon (proton or neutron) moved in a central potential which was created by the average effects of all the other nucleons.
22383,"This model failed, however, to give the correct values for the higher magic numbers."
22384,"Then it was discovered by Maria Mayer, and independently by Jensen and his collaborators, that by taking the independent particle model and adding only a correction for what is called the “spin-orbit interaction,” one could make an improved model which gave all of the magic numbers."
22385,(The spin-orbit interaction causes the energy of a nucleon to be lower if its spin has the same direction as its orbital angular momentum from motion in the nucleus.)
22386,The theory gives even more—its picture of the so-called “shell structure” of the nuclei enables us to predict certain characteristics of nuclei and of nuclear reactions.
22387,"The independent particle approximation has been found useful in a wide range of subjects—from solid-state physics, to chemistry, to biology, to nuclear physics."
22388,"It is often only a crude approximation, but is able to give an understanding of why there are especially stable conditions—in shells."
22389,"Since it omits all of the complexity of the interactions between the individual particles, we should not be surprised that it often fails completely to give correctly many important details."
22390,We are now going to discuss how the probability amplitudes of quantum mechanics vary in space.
22391,In some of the earlier chapters you may have had a rather uncomfortable feeling that some things were being left out.
22392,"For example, when we were talking about the ammonia molecule, we chose to describe it in terms of two base states."
22393,"For one base state we picked the situation in which the nitrogen atom was “above” the plane of the three hydrogen atoms, and for the other base state we picked the condition in which the nitrogen atom was “below” the plane of the three hydrogen atoms."
22394,Why did we pick just these two states?
22395,"Certainly, there are many positions that the nitrogen atom could occupy."
22396,"Again when we talked about the hydrogen molecular ion, in which there is one electron shared by two protons, we imagined two base states: one for the electron in the neighborhood of proton number one, and the other for the electron in the neighborhood of proton number two."
22397,Clearly we were leaving out many details.
22398,The electron is not exactly at proton number two but is only in the neighborhood.
22399,"It could be somewhere above the proton, somewhere below the proton, somewhere to the left of the proton, or somewhere to the right of the proton."
22400,We intentionally avoided discussing these details.
22401,"We said that we were interested in only certain features of the problem, so we were imagining that when the electron was in the vicinity of proton number one, it would take up a certain rather definite condition."
22402,"In that condition the probability to find the electron would have some rather definite distribution around the proton, but we were not interested in the details."
22403,We can also put it another way.
22404,In our discussion of a hydrogen molecular ion we chose an approximate description when we described the situation in terms of two base states.
22405,In reality there are lots and lots of these states.
22406,"An electron can take up a condition around a proton in its lowest, or ground, state, but there are also many excited states."
22407,For each excited state the distribution of the electron around the proton is different.
22408,"We ignored these excited states, saying that we were interested in only the conditions of low energy."
22409,But it is just these other excited states which give the possibility of various distributions of the electron around the proton.
22410,"If we want to describe in detail the hydrogen molecular ion, we have to take into account also these other possible base states."
22411,"We could do this in several ways, and one way is to consider in greater detail states in which the location of the electron in space is more carefully described."
22412,"We are now ready to consider a more elaborate procedure which will allow us to talk in detail about the position of the electron, by giving a probability amplitude to find the electron anywhere and everywhere in a given situation."
22413,This more complete theory provides the underpinning for the approximations we have been making in our earlier discussions.
22414,"In a sense, our early equations can be derived as a kind of approximation to the more complete theory."
22415,You may be wondering why we did not begin with the more complete theory and make the approximations as we went along.
22416,We have felt that it would be much easier for you to gain an understanding of the basic machinery of quantum mechanics by beginning with the two-state approximations and working gradually up to the more complete theory than to approach the subject the other way around.
22417,For this reason our approach to the subject appears to be in the reverse order to the one you will find in many books.
22418,As we go into the subject of this chapter you will notice that we are breaking a rule we have always followed in the past.
22419,Whenever we have taken up any subject we have always tried to give a more or less complete description of the physics—showing you as much as we could about where the ideas led to.
22420,We have tried to describe the general consequences of a theory as well as describing some specific detail so that you could see where the theory would lead.
22421,We are now going to break that rule; we are going to describe how one can talk about probability amplitudes in space and show you the differential equations which they satisfy.
22422,We will not have time to go on and discuss many of the obvious implications which come out of the theory.
22423,"Indeed we will not even be able to get far enough to relate this theory to some of the approximate formulations we have used earlier—for example, to the hydrogen molecule or to the ammonia molecule."
22424,"For once, we must leave our business unfinished and open-ended."
22425,"We are approaching the end of our course, and we must satisfy ourselves with trying to give you an introduction to the general ideas and with indicating the connections between what we have been describing and some of the other ways of approaching the subject of quantum mechanics."
22426,We hope to give you enough of an idea that you can go off by yourself and by reading books learn about many of the implications of the equations we are going to describe.
22427,"We must, after all, leave something for the future."
22428,Let’s review once more what we have found out about how an electron can move along a line of atoms.
22429,"When an electron has an amplitude to jump from one atom to the next, there are definite energy states in which the probability amplitude for finding the electron is distributed along the lattice in the form of a traveling wave."
22430,"Since waves of probability amplitude in a crystal behave like a particle, one might well expect that the general quantum mechanical description of a particle would show the same kind of wave behavior we observed for the lattice."
22431,In the limit we would be thinking of a case in which the electron could be anywhere along the line.
22432,We would have gone over to a continuous distribution of probability amplitudes.
22433,We would have the amplitude to find an electron anywhere along the line.
22434,This would be one way to describe the motion of an electron in a vacuum.
22435,"In other words, if we imagine that space can be labeled by an infinity of points all very close together and we can work out the equations that relate the amplitudes at one point to the amplitudes at neighboring points, we will have the quantum mechanical laws of motion of an electron in space."
22436,Let’s begin by recalling some of the general principles of quantum mechanics.
22437,Suppose we have a particle which can exist in various conditions in a quantum mechanical system.
22438,We then introduce the idea of base states.
22439,"First, all of these states are quite distinct—we say they are orthogonal."
22440,"In Chapter 13 when we were working out what happens with an electron placed on a linear array of atoms, we chose a set of base states in which the electron was localized at one or other of the atoms in the line."
22441,We will not generally bother to show explicitly this dependence.
22442,13.3).
22443,We found that Eq.
22444,(16.1).
22445,If that is all that were to happen the last term in Eq.
22446,(16.9) would just go to zero and there would be no physics.
22447,"Under these circumstances, Eq."
22448,"(16.9) would be unchanged, but what would happen to the differential equation (16.7)?"
22449,First we will rewrite Eq.
22450,The correct quantum mechanical equation for the motion of an electron in free space was first discovered by Schrödinger.
22451,For motion along a line it has exactly the form of Eq.
22452,We do not intend to have you think we have derived the Schrödinger equation but only wish to show you one way of thinking about it.
22453,"When Schrödinger first wrote it down, he gave a kind of derivation based on some heuristic arguments and some brilliant intuitive guesses."
22454,"Some of the arguments he used were even false, but that does not matter; the only important thing is that the ultimate equation gives a correct description of nature."
22455,The purpose of our discussion is then simply to show you that the correct fundamental quantum mechanical equation (16.13) has the same form you get for the limiting case of an electron moving along a line of atoms.
22456,This means that we can think of the differential equation in (16.13) as describing the diffusion of a probability amplitude from one point to the next along the line.
22457,"That is, if an electron has a certain amplitude to be at one point, it will, a little time later, have some amplitude to be at neighboring points."
22458,"In fact, the equation looks something like the diffusion equations which we have used in Volume I."
22459,But there is one main difference: the imaginary coefficient in front of the time derivative makes the behavior completely different from the ordinary diffusion such as you would have for a gas spreading out along a thin tube.
22460,"Ordinary diffusion gives rise to real exponential solutions, whereas the solutions of Eq."
22461,(16.13) are complex waves.
22462,"Now that you have some idea about how things are going to look, we want to go back to the beginning and study the problem of describing the motion of an electron along a line without having to consider states connected with atoms on a lattice."
22463,We want to go back to the beginning and see what ideas we have to use if we want to describe the motion of a free particle in space.
22464,"Since we are interested in the behavior of a particle, along a continuum, we will be dealing with an infinite number of possible states and, as you will see, the ideas we have developed for dealing with a finite number of states will need some technical modifications."
22465,We have already considered such amplitudes which vary in a continuous way with the coordinates when we talked about the variations of amplitude with time in Chapter 7.
22466,"We showed there, for example, that a particle with a definite momentum should be expected to have a particular variation of its amplitude in space."
22467,"Either set of base states is, of course, equally acceptable for a description of a quantum mechanical situation."
22468,We will come back later to the matter of the connection between them.
22469,"Before proceeding, we want to make one small change in notation which we hope will not be too confusing."
22470,We should indicate that in some way.
22471,"Although this would be a perfectly satisfactory notation, it is a little bit cumbersome and is not the one you will find in most books."
22472,In Eq.
22473,On the left-hand side of Eq.
22474,We hope it will not be too confusing once you get accustomed to the idea.
22475,"Unfortunately, the probability of finding a particle exactly at any particular point is zero."
22476,"The electron will, in general, be smeared out in a certain region of the line, and since, in any small piece of the line, there are an infinite number of points, the probability that it will be at any one of them cannot be a finite number."
22477,We can only describe the probability of finding an electron in terms of a probability distribution2 which gives the relative probability of finding the electron at various approximate locations along the line.
22478,We can modify our definitions to take this into account.
22479,We will now have to modify some of our earlier equations to make them compatible with this new definition of a probability amplitude.
22480,"When we were talking about a finite set of discrete states, we would have used Eq."
22481,(16.5).
22482,We should mention one qualification to what we have been saying.
22483,Any suitable set of base states must be complete if it is to be used for an adequate description of what is going on.
22484,"We will, however, not worry about such complications for the time being."
22485,"We can find this amplitude by using our basic equation for the resolution of amplitudes, Eq."
22486,(16.19).
22487,"We have again, however, a small problem about the normalizations."
22488,There are several ways the normalizations can be adjusted.
22489,"We will choose one of them which we think to be the most convenient, although that may not be apparent to you just now."
22490,(16.15).
22491,16–1.
22492,"I, footnote 40-1.]"
22493,Now let’s find the distribution in momentum.
22494,(16.25) into Eq.
22495,The Gaussian distribution gives the smallest possible value for the product of the root-mean-square widths.
22496,We return now to the discussion of the modifications of our basic equations which are required when we are dealing with a continuum of base states.
22497,These two conditions are described by Eq.
22498,(16.36).
22499,(16.36).
22500,"To see how we have to patch things up, we go back to Eq."
22501,"We can, therefore, rewrite Eq."
22502,It turns out that there is no mathematical function which will do this!
22503,At least nothing like what we ordinarily mean by a “function.”
22504,Then Eq.
22505,(16.39) will not be satisfied.
22506,(16.39).
22507,The function which does this was first invented by Dirac and carries his name.
22508,(16.41).
22509,16–2.
22510,Its properties are then as we have described.
22511,"(16.38), that equation is satisfied."
22512,We have now completed the necessary modifications of our basic equations which are necessary for dealing with the continuum of base states corresponding to the points along a line.
22513,"In other words, they become volume integrals."
22514,What happens when there is more than one particle?
22515,We will tell you about how to handle two particles and you will easily see what you must do if you want to deal with a larger number.
22516,"Suppose there are two particles, which we can call particle No."
22517,What shall we use for the base states?
22518,Notice that describing the position of only one particle does not define a base state.
22519,Each base state must define the condition of the entire system.
22520,You must not think that each particle moves independently as a wave in three dimensions.
22521,You see that such a function is not a wave in the sense of an oscillation that moves along in three dimensions.
22522,"Neither is it generally simply a product of two individual waves, one for each particle."
22523,"If there are two particles in nature which are interacting, there is no way of describing what happens to one of the particles by trying to write down a wave function for it alone."
22524,"The famous paradoxes that we considered in earlier chapters—where the measurements made on one particle were claimed to be able to tell what was going to happen to another particle, or were able to destroy an interference—have caused people all sorts of trouble because they have tried to think of the wave function of one particle alone, rather than the correct wave function in the coordinates of both particles."
22525,The complete description can be given correctly only in terms of functions of the coordinates of both particles.
22526,So far we have just been worrying about how we can describe states which may involve an electron being anywhere at all in space.
22527,Now we have to worry about putting into our description the physics of what can happen in various circumstances.
22528,"As before, we have to worry about how states can change with time."
22529,This time-varying wave function describes the evolution of successive states that occur as time develops.
22530,How would we expect Eq.
22531,Let’s first remember that Eq.
22532,(16.49).
22533,Then Eq.
22534,"This means—as we saw in the example of the chain of atoms at the beginning of the chapter, Eq."
22535,(16.12)—that the right-hand side of Eq.
22536,Nowhere.
22537,It’s not possible to derive it from anything you know.
22538,"It came out of the mind of Schrödinger, invented in his struggle to find an understanding of the experimental observations of the real world."
22539,You can perhaps get some clue of why it should be that way by thinking of our derivation of Eq.
22540,(16.12) which came from looking at the propagation of an electron in a crystal.
22541,"Of course, free particles are not very exciting."
22542,What happens if we put forces on the particle?
22543,(16.7) would vary slowly with position and would correspond to the new term we have added in (16.52).
22544,[You may be wondering why we went straight from Eq.
22545,(16.51) to Eq.
22546,(16.51) comes out in terms of things you are used to.
22547,(16.52).]
22548,It is fairly obvious what we should use instead of Eq.
22549,(16.53) if we are interested in motion in three dimensions.
22550,It was written down by Schrödinger before any of the other quantum equations we have described in this book were discovered.
22551,"Although we have approached the subject along a completely different route, the great historical moment marking the birth of the quantum mechanical description of matter occurred when Schrödinger first wrote down his equation in 1926."
22552,For many years the internal atomic structure of matter had been a great mystery.
22553,"No one had been able to understand what held matter together, why there was chemical binding, and especially how it could be that atoms could be stable."
22554,"Although Bohr had been able to give a description of the internal motion of an electron in a hydrogen atom which seemed to explain the observed spectrum of light emitted by this atom, the reason that electrons moved in this way remained a mystery."
22555,"Schrödinger’s discovery of the proper equations of motion for electrons on an atomic scale provided a theory from which atomic phenomena could be calculated quantitatively, accurately, and in detail."
22556,"In principle, Schrödinger’s equation is capable of explaining all atomic phenomena except those involving magnetism and relativity."
22557,"It explains the energy levels of an atom, and all the facts of chemical binding."
22558,"This is, however, true only in principle—the mathematics soon becomes too complicated to solve exactly any but the simplest problems."
22559,Only the hydrogen and helium atoms have been calculated to a high accuracy.
22560,"However, with various approximations, some fairly sloppy, many of the facts of more complicated atoms and of the chemical binding of molecules can be understood."
22561,We have shown you some of these approximations in earlier chapters.
22562,The Schrödinger equation as we have written it does not take into account any magnetic effects.
22563,It is possible to take such effects into account in an approximate way by adding some more terms to the equation.
22564,"However, as we have seen in Volume II, magnetism is essentially a relativistic effect, and so a correct description of the motion of an electron in an arbitrary electromagnetic field can only be discussed in a proper relativistic equation."
22565,"The correct relativistic equation for the motion of an electron was discovered by Dirac a year after Schrödinger brought forth his equation, and takes on quite a different form."
22566,We will not be able to discuss it at all here.
22567,"Before we go on to look at some of the consequences of the Schrödinger equation, we would like to show you what it looks like for a system with a large number of particles."
22568,In a later chapter we will look in detail at a solution of Schrödinger’s equation for a particular example.
22569,"We would like now, however, to show you how one of the most remarkable consequence of Schrödinger’s equation comes about—namely, the surprising fact that a differential equation involving only continuous functions of continuous variables in space can give rise to quantum effects such as the discrete energy levels in an atom."
22570,The essential fact to understand is how it can be that an electron which is confined to a certain region of space by some kind of a potential “well” must necessarily have only one or another of a certain well-defined set of discrete energies.
22571,16–3.
22572,We will assume that this potential is static—it doesn’t vary with time.
22573,"As we have done so many times before, we would like to look for solutions corresponding to states of definite energy, which means, of definite frequency."
22574,16–4.
22575,16–4.
22576,"The solution in such a region has, piece-by-piece, roughly the form of a sinusoidal curve."
22577,16–3.
22578,We can easily imagine a curve like the one shown in Fig.
22579,16–5.
22580,"There it curves away from the axis and takes off toward large positive values, as drawn in Fig."
22581,16–6.
22582,"In fact, its curvature is also increasing (if the potential continues to stay flat)."
22583,The amplitude rapidly grows to immense proportions.
22584,What does this mean?
22585,It simply means that the particle is not “bound” in the potential well.
22586,"It is infinitely more likely to be found outside of the well, than inside."
22587,We have failed to find a solution for a bound particle.
22588,16–7.
22589,"If we start with the same conditions on the left, we get the solution drawn in the lower half of Fig."
22590,16–7.
22591,Maybe that’s the clue.
22592,"There is, indeed, and we have sketched how the solution might look in Fig."
22593,16–8.
22594,You should appreciate that the solution we have drawn in the figure is a very special one.
22595,"If we were to raise or lower the energy ever so slightly, the function would go over into curves like one or the other of the two broken-line curves shown in Fig."
22596,"16–8, and we would not have the proper conditions for a bound particle."
22597,"We have obtained a result that if a particle is to be bound in a potential well, it can do so only if it has a very definite energy."
22598,Does that mean that there is only one energy for a particle bound in a potential well?
22599,No.
22600,Notice that the wave function we have drawn in Fig.
22601,The possible solutions are sketched in Fig.
22602,16–9.
22603,(There may also be other solutions corresponding to values of the energy higher than the ones shown.)
22604,"Our conclusion is that if a particle is bound in a potential well, its energy can take on only the certain special values in a discrete energy spectrum."
22605,You see how a differential equation can describe the basic fact of quantum physics.
22606,We might remark one other thing.
22607,Such solutions correspond to the scattering of free particles by a potential well.
22608,We have seen an example of such solutions when we considered the effects of impurity atoms in a crystal.
22609,"In classical physics there are a number of quantities which are conserved—such as momentum, energy, and angular momentum."
22610,Conservation theorems about corresponding quantities also exist in quantum mechanics.
22611,"The most beautiful thing of quantum mechanics is that the conservation theorems can, in a sense, be derived from something else, whereas in classical mechanics they are practically the starting points of the laws."
22612,"(There are ways in classical mechanics to do an analogous thing to what we will do in quantum mechanics, but it can be done only at a very advanced level.)"
22613,"In quantum mechanics, however, the conservation laws are very deeply related to the principle of superposition of amplitudes, and to the symmetry of physical systems under various changes."
22614,This is the subject of the present chapter.
22615,"Although we will apply these ideas mostly to the conservation of angular momentum, the essential point is that the theorems about the conservation of all kinds of quantities are—in the quantum mechanics—related to the symmetries of the system."
22616,"We begin, therefore, by studying the question of symmetries of systems."
22617,A very simple example is the hydrogen molecular ion—we could equally well take the ammonia molecule—in which there are two states.
22618,17–1(a).
22619,"Now, so long as the two nuclei are both exactly the same, then there is a certain symmetry in this physical system."
22620,"That is to say, if we were to reflect the system in the plane halfway between the two protons—by which we mean that everything on one side of the plane gets moved to the symmetric position on the other side—we would get the situations in Fig."
22621,17–1(b).
22622,From Eq.
22623,There are slight technical differences—like the difference between a “numeral” and a “number”—but the distinction is something pedantic that we don’t have to worry about.
22624,Now we would like to point out something.
22625,We will suppose that the physics of the whole hydrogen molecular ion system is symmetrical.
22626,"It doesn’t have to be—it depends, for instance, on what else is near it."
22627,"But if the system is symmetrical, the following idea should certainly be true."
22628,17–2.
22629,"So if the physics of a system is symmetrical with respect to some plane, and we work out the behavior of a particular state, we also know the behavior of the state we would get by reflecting the original state in the symmetry plane."
22630,We would like to say the same things a little bit more generally—which means a little more abstractly.
22631,"Or, in a system with two electrons, we might be thinking of the operation of interchanging the two electrons."
22632,"Another possibility would be, in a spherically symmetric system, the operation of a rotation of the whole system through a finite angle around some axis—which wouldn’t change the physics."
22633,Let’s think of some more examples.
22634,"If we have an atom with no external magnetic field or no external electric field, and if we were to turn the coordinates around any axis, it would be the same physical system."
22635,"Again, the ammonia molecule is symmetrical with respect to a reflection in a plane parallel to that of the three hydrogens—so long as there is no electric field."
22636,"When there is an electric field, when we make a reflection we would have to change the electric field also, and that changes the physical problem."
22637,"But if we have no external field, the molecule is symmetrical."
22638,Now we consider a general situation.
22639,(17.4).]
22640,(17.5).]
22641,Thinking of the hydrogen ion it says that: “making a reflection and waiting a while”—the expression on the right of Eq.
22642,(17.9)—is the same as “waiting a while and then making a reflection”—the expression on the left of (17.9).
22643,When Eq.
22644,"[In terms of matrices, the product of two operators is equivalent to the matrix product, so Eq."
22645,It defines a symmetry.
22646,"Before applying the result we have just found, we would like to discuss the idea of symmetry a little more."
22647,The probabilities are shown as a bar graph in Fig.
22648,17–3(a).
22649,17–3(b).
22650,"However, there is a difference if we look at the amplitudes."
22651,Let’s look at another example.
22652,So with certain symmetries something which is true initially is true for all times.
22653,But isn’t that just a conservation law?
22654,Yes!
22655,"It says that if you look at the original state and by making a little computation on the side discover that an operation which is a symmetry operation of the system produces only a multiplication by a certain phase, then you know that the same property will be true of the final state—the same operation multiplies the final state by the same phase factor."
22656,This is always true even though we may not know anything else about the inner mechanism of the universe which changes a system from the initial to the final state.
22657,"Even if we do not care to look at the details of the machinery by which the system gets from one state to another, we can still say that if a thing is in a state with a certain symmetry character originally, and if the Hamiltonian for this thing is symmetrical under that symmetry operation, then the state will have the same symmetry character for all times."
22658,That’s the basis of all the conservation laws of quantum mechanics.
22659,Let’s look at a special example.
22660,There is a special kind of a reflection that doesn’t require the specification of a plane.
22661,The whole thing is called an inversion.
22662,Every point is projected through the origin to the diametrically opposite position.
22663,All the coordinates of everything are reversed.
22664,It is shown in Fig.
22665,17–4.
22666,It is a little more convenient than a simple reflection because it doesn’t require that you specify which coordinate plane you used for the reflection—you need specify only the point which is at the center of symmetry.
22667,After two inversions we are right back where we started from—nothing is changed at all.
22668,"Classically, if a state is symmetric under an inversion, the operation gives back the same state."
22669,"In quantum mechanics, however, there are the two possibilities: we get the same state or minus the same state."
22670,(17.12).
22671,When we speak of an operation like inversion being performed “on a physical system” we can think about it in two ways.
22672,"Similarly, when we think of rotations, we can think of rotating bodily a physical system, or of rotating the coordinate frame with respect to which we measure the system, keeping the “system” fixed in space."
22673,"Generally, the two points of view are essentially equivalent."
22674,In these lectures we have usually considered what happens when a projection is made into a new set of axes.
22675,What you get that way is the same as what you get if you leave the axes fixed and rotate the system backwards by the same amount.
22676,"When you do that, the signs of the angles are reversed.3"
22677,Many of the laws of physics—but not all—are unchanged by a reflection or an inversion of the coordinates.
22678,They are symmetric with respect to an inversion.
22679,"The same is true for the laws of gravity, and for the strong interactions of nuclear physics."
22680,"(We discussed this in some detail in Chapter 52, Vol."
22681,I.)
22682,Under these circumstances we have the following proposition.
22683,"If a state originally has even parity, and if you look at the physical situation at some later time, it will again have even parity."
22684,"For instance, suppose an atom about to emit a photon is in a state known to have even parity."
22685,You look at the whole thing—including the photon—after the emission; it will again have even parity (likewise if you start with odd parity).
22686,This principle is called the conservation of parity.
22687,You can see why the words “conservation of parity” and “reflection symmetry” are closely intertwined in the quantum mechanics.
22688,"Although until a few years ago it was thought that nature always conserved parity, it is now known that this is not true."
22689,Now we can prove an interesting theorem (which is true so long as we can disregard weak interactions): Any state of definite energy which is not degenerate must have a definite parity.
22690,It must have either even parity or odd parity.
22691,(Remember that we have sometimes seen systems in which several states have the same energy—we say that such states are degenerate.
22692,Our theorem will not apply to them.)
22693,That’s the physical argument.
22694,The same thing comes out of our mathematics.
22695,Our definition of symmetry is Eq.
22696,(17.10) or Eq.
22697,So any state of a definite energy (which is not degenerate) has got either an even parity or an odd parity.
22698,We turn now to another interesting example of an operation: a rotation.
22699,"Now then, there are special states which have the property that such an operation produces a new state which is the original state multiplied by some phase factor."
22700,"If we know its value initially, we know its value at the end of the game."
22701,"Of course, you can rotate about any axis, and you get the conservation of angular momentum for the various axes."
22702,You see that the conservation of angular momentum is related to the fact that when you turn a system you get the same state with only a new phase factor.
22703,We would like to show you how general this idea is.
22704,We will apply it to two other conservation laws which have exact correspondence in the physical ideas to the conservation of angular momentum.
22705,"In classical physics we also have conservation of momentum and conservation of energy, and it is interesting to see that both of these are related in the same way to some physical symmetry."
22706,"Suppose that we have a physical system—an atom, some complicated nucleus, or a molecule, or something—and it doesn’t make any difference if we take the whole system and move it over to a different place."
22707,"So we have a Hamiltonian which has the property that it depends only on the internal coordinates in some sense, and does not depend on the absolute position in space."
22708,Under those circumstances there is a special symmetry operation we can perform which is a translation in space.
22709,Then for any state we can make this operation and get a new state.
22710,The total momentum of a system before and after collisions—or after explosions or what not—will be the same.
22711,There is another operation that is quite analogous to the displacement in space: a delay in time.
22712,"Suppose that we have a physical situation where there is nothing external that depends on time, and we start something off at a certain moment in a given state and let it roll."
22713,"Under those circumstances we can also find special states which have the property that the development in time has the special characteristic that the delayed state is just the old, multiplied by a phase factor."
22714,"(That’s what we have said before when we defined a quantum state of definite energy, so we’re consistent with ourselves.)"
22715,"You see, therefore, the relation between the conservation laws and the symmetry of the world."
22716,Symmetry with respect to reflection implies the conservation of parity.
22717,"Symmetry with respect to the interchange of two electrons implies the conservation of something we don’t have a name for, and so on."
22718,Some of these principles have classical analogs and others do not.
22719,"There are more conservation laws in quantum mechanics than are useful in classical mechanics—or, at least, than are usually made use of."
22720,"In order that you will be able to read other books on quantum mechanics, we must make a small technical aside—to describe the notation that people use."
22721,"Since any finite displacement or angle can be accumulated by a succession of infinitesimal displacements or angles, it is often easier to analyze first the infinitesimal case."
22722,The same thing is done for the other operations.
22723,We would now like to make some applications of the ideas of the conservation of angular momentum—to show you how they work.
22724,The point is that they are really very simple.
22725,You knew before that angular momentum is conserved.
22726,That’s all we will need to do a number of interesting things.
22727,First of all we would like to check on one idea.
22728,Indeed it does.
22729,It also means that if we have a beam of light containing a large number of photons all circularly polarized the same way—as we would have in a classical beam—it will carry angular momentum.
22730,That should be a classical proposition if everything is right.
22731,Here we have a case where we can go from the quantum thing to the classical thing.
22732,We should see if the classical physics checks.
22733,"Remember what right circularly polarized light is, classically."
22734,17–5(a).
22735,Now suppose that such light shines on a wall which is going to absorb it—or at least some of it—and consider an atom in the wall according to the classical physics.
22736,We have often described the motion of the electron in the atom as a harmonic oscillator which can be driven into oscillation by an external electric field.
22737,"The net result is that the electron moves in a circle, as shown in Fig."
22738,17–5(b).
22739,17–5(b).
22740,"As time goes on, the electric field rotates and the displacement rotates with the same frequency, so their relative orientation stays the same."
22741,Now let’s look at the work being done on this electron.
22742,(17.30).
22743,"The interference of these two amplitudes produces the linear polarization, but it has equal probabilities to appear with plus or minus one unit of angular momentum."
22744,"Macroscopic measurements made on a beam of linearly polarized light will show that it carries zero angular momentum, because in a large number of photons there are nearly equal numbers of RHC and LHC photons contributing opposite amounts of angular momentum—the average angular momentum is zero."
22745,And in the classical theory you don’t find the angular momentum unless there is some circular polarization.
22746,But light is screwy; it has only two states.
22747,It does not have the zero case.
22748,This strange lack is related to the fact that light cannot stand still.
22749,"For example, light does not have three states, but only two—although a photon is still an object of spin one."
22750,How is this consistent with our earlier proofs—based on what happens under rotations in space—that for spin-one particles three states are necessary?
22751,"For a particle at rest, rotations can be made about any axis without changing the momentum state."
22752,Particles with zero rest mass (like photons and neutrinos) cannot be at rest; only rotations about the axis along the direction of motion do not change the momentum state.
22753,One further side remark.
22754,Now we want to give an example of how we use the theorem of conservation of angular momentum in a specifically quantum physical problem.
22755,17–6(a).
22756,17–6(b)?
22757,"In other words, what is the angular distribution of the disintegrations?"
22758,17–7).
22759,"Then, from the conservation of momentum, the pion must go down."
22760,"Since the proton is a spin one-half particle, its spin must be either “up” or “down”—there are, in principle, the two possibilities shown in parts (b) and (c) of the figure."
22761,"The conservation of angular momentum, however, requires that the proton have spin “up.” This is most easily seen from the following argument."
22762,"We can say that since the pion has no spin, the proton spin must be “up.”"
22763,"If you are worried that arguments of this kind may not be valid in quantum mechanics, we can take a moment to show you that they are."
22764,That’s what we mean by spin “up” for a spin one-half particle.
22765,"Since nature’s behavior doesn’t depend on our choice of axes, the final state (the proton plus pion) must have the same property."
22766,(That’s why we picked this special case; we couldn’t make the argument otherwise.)
22767,"Also, nothing happens to the pion, because it is spin zero."
22768,"The proton, however, has spin one-half."
22769,But the phase change with rotation before and after the excitement must be the same if angular momentum is to be conserved.
22770,"(And it will be, since there are no outside influences in the Hamiltonian.)"
22771,"So the only possibility is that the proton spin will be “up.” If the proton goes up, its spin must also be “up.”"
22772,"We conclude, then, that the conservation of angular momentum permits the process shown in part (b) of Fig."
22773,"17–7, but does not permit the process shown in part (c)."
22774,17–8.
22775,You will appreciate that in this case the proton must have spin “down” if angular momentum is conserved.
22776,We’ll have to get them from experiment.
22777,But with just these two amplitudes we can find out all we want to know about the angular distribution of the disintegration.
22778,We only have to be careful always to define completely the states we are talking about.
22779,17–6.
22780,We know how to analyze what happens along this axis.
22781,(10.30).
22782,17–9.
22783,Let’s now ask the following easy question.
22784,So to get the probability we square the amplitudes and add.
22785,Now there are many other questions we can answer.
22786,"If parity were conserved, we could say one more thing."
22787,The disintegration of Fig.
22788,"The experimental results show, however, that there is an asymmetry in the disintegration."
22789,"Also, we see that parity is not conserved."
22790,The lack of symmetry under a reflection is quite clear.
22791,You see how much we can get from the conservation of angular momentum.
22792,We will give some more examples in the next chapter.
22793,"

Parenthetical note."
22794,We would like now to bring together in one place the various things we have learned about the rotations for particles of spin one-half and spin one—so they will be convenient for future reference.
22795,"Knowing these two rotations, you can, of course, work out any arbitrary rotation."
22796,"As usual, we write the matrix elements so that the state on the left is a base state of the new (rotated) frame and the state on the right is a base state of the old (unrotated) frame."
22797,You can interpret the entries in the tables in many ways.
22798,It’s all the same thing.
22799,"We want now to give you a number of other, similar, illustrations of the consequences of momentum conservation in atomic systems."
22800,Our first example is the radiation of light from an atom.
22801,The conservation of angular momentum (among other things) will determine the polarization and angular distribution of the emitted photons.
22802,"Suppose we have an atom which is in an excited state of definite angular momentum—say with a spin of one—and it makes a transition to a state of angular momentum zero at a lower energy, emitting a photon."
22803,The problem is to figure out the angular distribution and polarization of the photons.
22804,"Once you see how it goes, you can work out the other cases."
22805,"Well, we don’t know the answer to that."
22806,But we do know that right circularly polarized light has one unit of angular momentum about its direction of propagation.
22807,"So after the photon is emitted, the situation would have to be as shown in Fig."
22808,Notice that the amplitude to emit a LHC photon in the same direction is zero.
22809,18–2.
22810,Suppose we perform an inversion of the situation in Fig.
22811,"18–1, which means that we should imagine what the system would look like if we were to move each part of the system to an equivalent point on the opposite side of the origin."
22812,"This does not mean that we should reflect the angular momentum vectors, because they are artificial."
22813,"We should, rather, invert the actual character of the motion that would correspond to such an angular momentum."
22814,In Fig.
22815,18–3(a) and (b) we show what the process of Fig.
22816,18–1 looks like before and after an inversion with respect to the center of the atom.
22817,Notice that the sense of rotation of the atom is unchanged.1 In the inverted system of Fig.
22818,If we now rotate the system of Fig.
22819,18–2.
22820,The combination of the inversion and rotation turns the second process into the first.
22821,The sign change in the inversion will depend on the parities of the initial and final state of the atom.
22822,"In atomic processes, parity is conserved, so the parity of the whole system must be the same before and after the photon emission."
22823,What happens will depend on whether the parities of the initial and final states of the atom are even or odd—the angular distribution of the radiation will be different for different cases.
22824,"We will take the common case of odd parity for the initial state and even parity for the final state; it will give what is called “electric dipole radiation.” (If the initial and final states have the same parity we say there is “magnetic dipole radiation,” which has the character of the radiation from an oscillating current in a loop.)"
22825,"If the parity of the initial state is odd, its amplitude reverses its sign in the inversion which takes the system from (a) to (b) of Fig."
22826,18–3.
22827,"The final state of the atom has even parity, so its amplitude doesn’t change sign."
22828,The amplitudes for these three states are just the ones given in the lower half of Table 17–2.
22829,"To get the intensity of any component as a function of angle, you must, of course, take the absolute square of the amplitudes."
22830,Let’s use these results to solve a somewhat more complicated problem—but also one which is somewhat more real.
22831,18–4(a).
22832,"We can consider the scattering of light as a two-step process: The photon is absorbed, and then is re-emitted."
22833,If we start with a RHC photon as in Fig.
22834,18–4(b).
22835,18–4(c).
22836,There is also an amplitude that a RHC photon will be absorbed and that a LHC photon will be emitted.
22837,Now let’s ask about what happens if a LHC photon comes in.
22838,If we make a measurement of the scattered intensity for any given combination of circular polarizations it will be proportional to the square of one of our four amplitudes.
22839,"That’s all very well, but suppose we start out with linearly polarized light."
22840,What then?
22841,You can get it by the usual rule for combining amplitudes.
22842,Now we notice something interesting.
22843,The results (18.17) and (18.18) correspond exactly to the classical theory of light scattering we gave in Vol.
22844,"I, Section 32-5, where we imagined that the electron was bound to the atom by a linear restoring force—so that it acted like a classical oscillator."
22845,"If the excited state had spin two, you would get a different result."
22846,"Also, there is no reason why the model of an electron attached to a spring and driven by an oscillating electric field should work for a single photon."
22847,"But we have found that it does in fact work, and that the polarization and intensities come out right."
22848,So in a certain sense we are bringing the whole course around to the real truth.
22849,"Whereas we have, in Vol."
22850,"I, done the theory of the index of refraction, and of light scattering, by the classical theory, we have now shown that the quantum theory gives the same result for the most common case."
22851,"In effect we have now done the polarization of sky light, for instance, by quantum mechanical arguments, which is the only truly legitimate way."
22852,"It should be, of course, that all the classical theories which work are supported ultimately by legitimate quantum arguments."
22853,"Naturally, those things which we have spent a great deal of time in explaining to you were selected from just those parts of classical physics which still maintain validity in quantum mechanics."
22854,You’ll notice that we did not discuss in great detail any model of the atom which has electrons going around in orbits.
22855,That’s because such a model doesn’t give results which agree with the quantum mechanics.
22856,"But the electron on a spring—which is not, in a sense, at all the way an atom “looks”—does work, and so we used that model for the theory of the index of refraction."
22857,We would like next to take an example which is very pretty.
22858,"It is quite interesting and, although somewhat complicated, we hope not too much so."
22859,"It is like a hydrogen atom, except that a positron replaces the proton."
22860,This object has—like the hydrogen atom—many states.
22861,"Also like the hydrogen, the ground state is split into a “hyperfine structure” by the interaction of the magnetic moments."
22862,"The spins of the electron and positron are each one-half, and they can be either parallel or antiparallel to any given axis."
22863,(In the ground state there is no other angular momentum due to orbital motion.)
22864,"So there are four states: three are the substates of a spin-one system, all with the same energy; and one is a state of spin zero with a different energy."
22865,"The most important difference, however, is that positronium cannot last forever."
22866,The positron is the antiparticle of the electron; they can annihilate each other.
22867,"In the disintegration, two particles with a finite rest mass go into two or more objects which have zero rest mass.3"
22868,We begin by analyzing the disintegration of the spin-zero state of the positronium.
22869,"Initially, we have a positron and an electron close together and with spins antiparallel, making the positronium system."
22870,After the disintegration there are two photons going out with equal and opposite momenta (Fig.
22871,18–5).
22872,"The momenta must be equal and opposite, because the total momentum after the disintegration must be zero, as it was before, if we are taking the case of annihilation at rest."
22873,"If the positronium is not at rest, we can ride with it, solve the problem, and then transform everything back to the lab system."
22874,"(See, we can do anything now; we have all the tools.)"
22875,"First, we note that the angular distribution is not very interesting."
22876,"Since the initial state has spin zero, it has no special axis—it is symmetric under all rotations."
22877,The final state must then also be symmetric under all rotations.
22878,That means that all angles for the disintegration are equally likely—the amplitude is the same for a photon to go in any direction.
22879,"Of course, once we find one of the photons in some direction the other must be opposite."
22880,"The only remaining question, which we now want to look at, is about the polarization of the photons."
22881,"We can use any representations we want for the polarization states of the photons; we will choose for our description right and left circular polarization—always with respect to the directions of motion.4 Right away, we can see that if the photon going upward is RHC, then angular momentum will be conserved if the downward going photon is also RHC."
22882,"The total will be zero, and the angular momentum after the disintegration will be the same as before."
22883,See Fig.
22884,18–6.
22885,"The same arguments show that if the upward going photon is RHC, the downward cannot be LHC."
22886,Then the final state would have two units of angular momentum.
22887,This is not permitted if the initial state has spin zero.
22888,"Note that such a final state is also not possible for the other positronium ground state of spin one, because it can have a maximum of one unit of angular momentum in any direction."
22889,Now we want to show that two-photon annihilation is not possible at all from the spin-one state.
22890,"Certainly, the disintegration sketched in Fig."
22891,18–7(b).
22892,It is exactly the same as in part (a) of the figure.
22893,All we have done is interchange the two photons.
22894,"Now photons are Bose particles; if we interchange them, the amplitude has the same sign, so the amplitude for the disintegration in part (b) must be the same as in part (a)."
22895,But we have assumed that the initial object is spin one.
22896,So the amplitudes for (a) and (b) in Fig.
22897,18–7 should have opposite signs; the spin-one state cannot disintegrate into two photons.
22898,"There is still an annihilation, but it has to go with three photons."
22899,This is what is observed experimentally.
22900,We will not go into any more of the details of the spin-one annihilation.
22901,"So far we have that if we only worry about angular momentum, the spin-zero state of the positronium can go into two RHC photons."
22902,There is also another possibility: it can go into two LHC photons as shown in Fig.
22903,18–8.
22904,"The next question is, what is the relation between the amplitudes for these two possible decay modes?"
22905,We can find out from the conservation of parity.
22906,"To do that, however, we need to know the parity of the positronium."
22907,"Now theoretical physicists have shown in a way that is not easy to explain that the parity of the electron and the positron—its antiparticle—must be opposite, so that the spin-zero ground state of positronium must be odd."
22908,"We will just assume that it is odd, and since we will get agreement with experiment, we can take that as sufficient proof."
22909,Let’s see then what happens if we make an inversion of the process in Fig.
22910,18–6.
22911,"When we do that, the two photons reverse directions and polarizations."
22912,The inverted picture looks just like Fig.
22913,18–8.
22914,"Assuming that the parity of the positronium is odd, the amplitudes for the two processes in Figs."
22915,18–6 and 18–8 must have the opposite sign.
22916,"18–8, in which both photons are LHC."
22917,This is the only final state that conserves both angular momentum and parity.
22918,"There is some amplitude that the disintegration into this state will occur, which we don’t need to worry about now, however, since we are only interested in questions about the polarization."
22919,What does the final state of (18.19) mean physically?
22920,"One thing it means is the following: If we observe the two photons in two detectors which can be set to count separately the RHC or LHC photons, we will always see two RHC photons together, or two LHC photons together."
22921,"That is, if you stand on one side of the positronium and someone else stands on the opposite side, you can measure the polarization and tell the other guy what polarization he will get."
22922,Let’s ask what happens if we observe the photon in counters that accept only linearly polarized light.
22923,"But let’s imagine that there is, to make the discussion easier."
22924,What is the chance you will pick up the two photons from an annihilation?
22925,"Now although we are working with two-particle amplitudes for the two photons, we can handle them just as we did the single particle amplitudes, since each particle acts independently of the other."
22926,He would never get a count when you got one.
22927,Now this all leads to an interesting situation.
22928,"If the guy on the other side does the same thing, you can always tell him which beam his photon is going to go into."
22929,"Whenever you and he get simultaneous counts, you can see which of your detectors caught the photon and then tell him which of his counters had a photon."
22930,Now many people who learn quantum mechanics in the usual (old-fashioned) way find this disturbing.
22931,They would like to think that once the photons are emitted it goes along as a wave with a definite character.
22932,"They argue that “someone else making a measurement shouldn’t be able to change the probability that I will find something.” Our quantum mechanics says, however, that by making a measurement on photon number one, you can predict precisely what the polarization of photon number two is going to be when it is detected."
22933,"This point was never accepted by Einstein, and he worried about it a great deal—it became known as the “Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox.” But when the situation is described as we have done it here, there doesn’t seem to be any paradox at all; it comes out quite naturally that what is measured in one place is correlated with what is measured somewhere else."
22934,"The argument that the result is paradoxical runs something like this: 
If you have a counter which tells you whether your photon is RHC or LHC, you can predict exactly what kind of a photon (RHC or LHC) he will find."
22935,"The photons he receives must, therefore, each be purely RHC or purely LHC, some of one kind and some of the other."
22936,Surely you cannot alter the physical nature of his photons by changing the kind of observation you make on your photons.
22937,"No matter what measurements you make on yours, his must still be either RHC or LHC."
22938,"There is absolutely no way, according to quantum mechanics, to tell into which beam any particular RHC photon will go."
22939,And the same goes for a LHC photon.
22940,This is in contradiction to (5) so there is a paradox.
22941,"Nature apparently doesn’t see the “paradox,” however, because experiment shows that the prediction in (6) is, in fact, true."
22942,"We have already discussed the key to this “paradox” in our very first lecture on quantum mechanical behavior in Chapter 37, Vol."
22943,"I.6 In the argument above, steps (1), (2), (4), and (6) are all correct, but (3), and its consequence (5), are wrong; they are not a true description of nature."
22944,"Argument (3) says that by your measurement (seeing a RHC or a LHC photon) you can determine which of two alternative events occurs for him (seeing a RHC or a LHC photon), and that even if you do not make your measurement you can still say that his event will occur either by one alternative or the other."
22945,"But it was precisely the point of Chapter 37, Vol."
22946,"I, to point out right at the beginning that this is not so in Nature."
22947,"Her way requires a description in terms of interfering amplitudes, one amplitude for each alternative."
22948,"A measurement of which alternative actually occurs destroys the interference, but if a measurement is not made you cannot still say that “one alternative or the other is still occurring.”"
22949,But you cannot do that—it is an example of the uncertainty principle.
22950,Do you still think there is a “paradox”?
22951,"Make sure that it is, in fact, a paradox about the behavior of Nature, by setting up an imaginary experiment for which the theory of quantum mechanics would predict inconsistent results via two different arguments."
22952,Otherwise the “paradox” is only a conflict between reality and your feeling of what reality “ought to be.”
22953,"Do you think that it is not a “paradox,” but that it is still very peculiar?"
22954,On that we can all agree.
22955,It is what makes physics fascinating.
22956,"By now you can see, we hope, how important the idea of the angular momentum is in understanding atomic processes."
22957,"So far, we have considered only systems with spins—or “total angular momentum”—of zero, one-half, or one."
22958,"There are, of course, atomic systems with higher angular momenta."
22959,For analyzing such systems we would need to have tables of rotation amplitudes like those in Section 17-6.
22960,"Although we will not work out these tables in detail, we would like to show you how it is done, so that you can do it if you ever need to."
22961,We can’t tell you how to do it in a basic way (with what we have had).
22962,We did it for spin one-half by a complicated symmetry argument.
22963,We then did it for spin one by taking the special case of a spin-one system which was made up of two spin one-half particles.
22964,"We can even avoid complications by imagining that they are all distinct particles—like a proton, an electron, and a muon."
22965,"By transforming each spin one-half object, we can see what happens to the whole system—remembering that the three amplitudes are multiplied for the combined state."
22966,Let’s see how it goes in this case.
22967,"Since each spin one-half object has the same chance of coming out minus under the rotation, the amounts of each of these three combinations should be equal."
22968,Notice that we take only the symmetric combinations—we do not take any combinations with minus signs.
22969,We can proceed in exactly the same way we did for the spin-one case in Section 12-6.
22970,(It just takes a little more algebra.)
22971,"We will follow directly the ideas of Chapter 12, so we won’t repeat all the explanations in detail."
22972,"When we have three spin one-half particles, Eq."
22973,The first column comes from Eq.
22974,(18.32); the second from (18.34).
22975,The last two columns were worked out in the same way.
22976,"Sums are taken over all the possible ways this can be done, and the state is normalized by multiplying by a suitable constant."
22977,Several special matrix elements are of extra importance and have been given special names.
22978,We would like to show you one example of the application of the coefficients we have just described.
22979,"It has to do with a recent, interesting experiment which you will now be able to understand."
22980,The experiment was set up as shown in Fig.
22981,18–9.
22982,The idea of the experiment is the following.
22983,The experimental results are shown in Fig.
22984,18–10 for two of the excited states.
22985,This information can then be used for trying to understand what the configuration of protons and neutrons is inside this nucleus—one more piece of information about the mysterious nuclear forces.
22986,When we studied the hyperfine structure of the hydrogen atom in Chapter 12 we had to work out the internal states of a system composed of two particles—the electron and the proton—each with a spin of one-half.
22987,"We found that the four possible spin states of such a system could be put together into two groups—a group with one energy that looked to the external world like a spin-one particle, and one remaining state that behaved like a particle of zero spin."
22988,"That is, putting together two spin one-half particles we can form a system whose “total spin” is one, or zero."
22989,In this section we want to discuss in more general terms the spin states of a system which is made up of two particles of arbitrary spin.
22990,It is another important problem about angular momentum in quantum mechanical systems.
22991,Let’s first rewrite the results of Chapter 12 for the hydrogen atom in a form that will be easier to extend to the more general case.
22992,Various combinations of the spin states of the two particles could be formed.
22993,In this new language we can rewrite the formulas in (12.41) and (12.42) as shown in Table 18–3.
22994,We want to discuss the hyperfine states of deuterium—just the way we did for hydrogen.
22995,Now we ask: What happens to these states if we project into a different coordinate system?
22996,They are called the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.
22997,Our next problem is to find out what they are.
22998,"We can find out easily if we just remember that the deuteron is made up of a neutron and a proton, and write the deuteron states out more explicitly using the rules of Table 18–3."
22999,"If we do that, the states listed in (18.42) then look as shown in Table 18–4."
23000,"But this state is also the same as the first in the list of (18.42), confirming our statement in (18.45)."
23001,"That is, Eq."
23002,"We summarize (18.45), (18.48), (18.50), and (18.51) in Table 18–5."
23003,"We have, however, only four states here while the system we are considering has six possible states."
23004,We can verify that these two states do indeed behave like the states of a spin one-half object by writing out the deuterium parts in terms of the neutron and proton states—using Table 18–4.
23005,"Together they form a spin-zero state (see the bottom line of Table 18–3), and contribute no angular momentum."
23006,So our results are confirmed.
23007,The results of Table 18–5 and of Eq.
23008,(18.54) were obtained by making use of the fact that the deuteron is made up of a neutron and a proton.
23009,The truth of the equations does not depend on that special circumstance.
23010,For any spin-one object put together with any spin one-half object the composition laws (and the coefficients) are the same.
23011,Under the same rotation the states of (18.54) will change as the states of a spin one-half object.
23012,"The results depend only on the rotation properties (that is, the spin states) of the two original particles but not in any way on the origins of their angular momenta."
23013,We have only made use of this fact to work out the formulas by choosing a special case in which one of the component parts is itself made up of two spin one-half particles in a symmetric state.
23014,Suppose we have the general problem of finding the states which can be formed when two objects of arbitrary spins are combined.
23015,"So each of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients has, if you wish, six indices identifying its position in the formulas like those of Tables 18–3 and 18–6."
23016,"We will not calculate here the coefficients for any other special cases.9 You can, however, find tables in many books."
23017,You might wish to try another special case for yourself.
23018,The next one to do would be the composition of two spin-one particles.
23019,We give just the final result in Table 18–7.
23020,These laws of the composition of angular momenta are very important in particle physics—where they have innumerable applications.
23021,"Unfortunately, we have no time to look at more examples here."
23022,"It is really not very important to work out the general case; once you have the idea, you can find the general results in tables in many books."
23023,"On the other hand, after coming this far you might like to see that you can indeed understand even the very complicated formulas of quantum mechanics, such as Eq."
23024,"(18.35), that come into the description of angular momentum."
23025,"To normalize each state, we should divide the sum by the square root of this number."
23026,It will help our work if we now go to still another notation.
23027,Once we have defined the states by Eq.
23028,Suppose we collect all such terms.
23029,Then Eq.
23030,This expression is then the matrix element we wanted.
23031,(18.35) in Section 18-4.
23032,Neither of these states has a definite parity.
23033,"What about our earlier proof that an atom in a state of definite energy must have a definite parity, and our statement that parity is conserved in atomic processes?"
23034,Shouldn’t the final state in this problem (the state after the emission of a photon) have a definite parity?
23035,It does if we consider the complete final state which contains amplitudes for the emission of photons into all sorts of angles.
23036,In Section 18-1 we chose to consider only a part of the complete final state.
23037,If we wish we can look only at final states that do have a definite parity.
23038,"Next, we wish to consider the decay of an excited state of odd parity to a ground state of even parity."
23039,"If parity is to be conserved, the final state of the photon must have odd parity."
23040,It must be the state in (18.75).
23041,This agrees with the result we found in Section 18-1.
23042,The most dramatic success in the history of the quantum mechanics was the understanding of the details of the spectra of some simple atoms and the understanding of the periodicities which are found in the table of chemical elements.
23043,"In this chapter we will at last bring our quantum mechanics to the point of this important achievement, specifically to an understanding of the spectrum of the hydrogen atom."
23044,We will at the same time arrive at a qualitative explanation of the mysterious properties of the chemical elements.
23045,We will do this by studying in detail the behavior of the electron in a hydrogen atom—for the first time making a detailed calculation of a distribution-in-space according to the ideas we developed in Chapter 16.
23046,For a complete description of the hydrogen atom we should describe the motions of both the proton and the electron.
23047,"It is possible to do this in quantum mechanics in a way that is analogous to the classical idea of describing the motion of each particle relative to the center of gravity, but we will not do so."
23048,"We will just discuss an approximation in which we consider the proton to be very heavy, so we can think of it as fixed at the center of the atom."
23049,We will make another approximation by forgetting that the electron has a spin and should be described by relativistic laws of mechanics.
23050,Some small corrections to our treatment will be required since we will be using the nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation and will disregard magnetic effects.
23051,Small magnetic effects occur because from the electron’s point-of-view the proton is a circulating charge which produces a magnetic field.
23052,In this field the electron will have a different energy with its spin up than with it down.
23053,The energy of the atom will be shifted a little bit from what we will calculate.
23054,We will ignore this small energy shift.
23055,Also we will imagine that the electron is just like a gyroscope moving around in space always keeping the same direction of spin.
23056,Since we will be considering a free atom in space the total angular momentum will be conserved.
23057,"In our approximation we will assume that the angular momentum of the electron spin stays constant, so all the rest of the angular momentum of the atom—what is usually called “orbital” angular momentum—will also be conserved."
23058,To an excellent approximation the electron moves in the hydrogen atom like a particle without spin—the angular momentum of the motion is a constant.
23059,With these approximations the amplitude to find the electron at different places in space can be represented by a function of position in space and time.
23060,According to the quantum mechanics the rate of change of this amplitude with time is given by the Hamiltonian operator working on the same function.
23061,"Since the potential energy term depends only on the radius, it turns out to be much more convenient to solve this equation in polar coordinates rather than rectangular coordinates."
23062,19–1.
23063,Let’s first try to find some very simple function that satisfies the horrible equation in (19.7).
23064,"For a wave function that doesn’t depend on the angles, none of the amplitudes will change in any way if you rotate the coordinate system."
23065,That means that all of the components of the angular momentum are zero.
23066,"(Actually, it is only the orbital angular momentum which is zero because we still have the spin of the electron, but we are ignoring that part.)"
23067,A state with zero orbital angular momentum is called by a special name.
23068,Then the algebra will be easier.
23069,"(19.13)—in other words, we just have to solve a differential equation."
23070,"Unfortunately, there is no very useful, general method for solving any given differential equation."
23071,You just have to fiddle around.
23072,"Our equation is not easy, but people have found that it can be solved by the following procedure."
23073,You may think we are no better off than we were at Eq.
23074,"(It is possible, in principle, to solve (19.13) that way too, but it is much harder.)"
23075,We are saying that Eq.
23076,Now all we have to do is find a suitable infinite set of coefficients!
23077,Let’s check to see that such a solution will work.
23078,It will all look better if we replace the first sum by an equivalent.
23079,That is certainly easy to arrange.
23080,"We have a solution, but what does it represent physically?"
23081,We have found a mathematical solution but not a physical one.
23082,It represents a situation in which the electron is least likely to be near the proton!
23083,"We have to think whether there is some way to beat the game, and there is."
23084,Observe!
23085,All higher terms would also be zero.
23086,We wouldn’t have an infinite series but a finite polynomial.
23087,Looking back to Eq.
23088,"When it is close to the proton, its energy is less, so somewhat below zero."
23089,"Before the discovery of quantum mechanics, it was known from experimental studies of the spectrum of hydrogen that the energy levels could be described by Eq."
23090,But it was the first great success of the Schrödinger theory that it could reproduce this result from a basic equation of motion for the electron.
23091,"Now that we have solved our first atom, let’s look at the nature of the solution we got."
23092,We have no need to do that just now.)
23093,The wave function for this state will have two terms.
23094,19–2.
23095,You can see the general trend.
23096,Such states have zero orbital angular momentum.
23097,We should now inquire about states which may have some angular dependences.
23098,You will find this done in many books.
23099,We are going to take a short cut by using the knowledge we already have about how amplitudes depend on angles in space.
23100,"Part of this spin comes from the electron’s intrinsic spin, and part from the electron’s motion."
23101,Since each of these two components acts independently (to an excellent approximation) we will again ignore the spin part and think only about the “orbital” angular momentum.
23102,"This orbital motion behaves, however, just like a spin."
23103,"Also, all the rotation matrices and other properties we have worked out still apply."
23104,(From now on we will really ignore the electron’s spin; when we speak of “angular momentum” we will mean only the orbital part.)
23105,It follows that the angular momentum and all its components are conserved.
23106,Zero.
23107,How?
23108,Watch.
23109,"Therefore, the result is the product of two factors."
23110,Let’s write it out.
23111,We have worked out earlier the transformation matrices for rotations.
23112,The particular functions which appear in (19.31) also show up in many kinds of problems which involve waves in spherical geometries and so has been given a special name.
23113,19–4.
23114,"To solve this problem we make, first, the following observation."
23115,"Then, to find the amplitude for a decay at the arbitrary angle of Fig."
23116,"19–4, all we need to know is what amplitude the given initial state has zero angular momentum about the decay direction."
23117,This latter amplitude is just what we have written in (19.31).
23118,From Table 17–2 we know the necessary amplitudes.
23119,Amplitudes such as the ones in (19.36) appear so often and are sufficiently important that they are given several names.
23120,"If you are going to understand what other physicists are talking about, you will just have to memorize the language."
23121,In Table 19–1 we give a dictionary of orbital angular momentum.
23122,The letters don’t mean anything.
23123,"(They did once mean something—they meant “sharp” lines, “principal” lines, “diffuse” lines and “fundamental” lines of the optical spectra of atoms."
23124,But those were in the days when people did not know where the lines came from.
23125,The angular functions in the table go by several names—and are sometimes defined with slightly different conventions about the numerical factors that appear out in front.
23126,"As we have seen, these angular distributions may refer to a nuclear disintegration or some other process, or to the distribution of the amplitude to find an electron at some place in the hydrogen atom."
23127,That’s interesting.
23128,In Eq.
23129,Let’s see what that means.
23130,This must also be true for the right-hand side.
23131,It must be some constant.
23132,Now look at what we’ve done.
23133,From Eq.
23134,Let’s rewrite (19.41) in the form we had in Eq.
23135,"Although we got this term by some mathematical shenanigan, it has a simple physical origin."
23136,We can give you an idea about where it comes from in terms of a semi-classical argument.
23137,Then perhaps you will not find it quite so mysterious.
23138,Think of a classical particle moving around some center of force.
23139,But this is almost exactly the extra term in (19.46).
23140,"But we have seen before (for example, Volume II, Section 34-7) that this is just the substitution that is usually required to make a quasi-classical argument agree with a correct quantum-mechanical calculation."
23141,"We can, then, understand the new term as a “pseudo-potential” which gives the “centrifugal force” term that appears in the equations of radial motion for a rotating system."
23142,"(See the discussion of “pseudo-forces” in Volume I, Section 12-5.)"
23143,We are now ready to solve Eq.
23144,It is very much like Eq.
23145,"(19.8), so the same technique will work again."
23146,Everything goes as before until you get to Eq.
23147,Instead of Eq.
23148,This condition replaces Eq.
23149,As before the series must terminate if we are to have solutions which can represent bound electrons.
23150,"However, Eq."
23151,(19.50) also gives a new restriction.
23152,"We have, finally, a complete description of the states of a hydrogen atom."
23153,Let’s review what we have discovered.
23154,"It is a “nondegenerate” state—there is only one with this energy, and its wave function is spherically symmetric."
23155,"The amplitude to find the electron is a maximum at the center, and falls off monotonically with increasing distance from the center."
23156,We can visualize the electron amplitude as a blob as shown in Fig.
23157,19–6(a).
23158,19–6(b).
23159,"(The dark areas indicate regions where the amplitude is large, and the plus and minus signs indicate the relative phases of the amplitude.)"
23160,19–7.
23161,The energy levels are as shown in Fig.
23162,19–7.
23163,The angular dependences of these states are given in Table 19–1.
23164,19–6(d).
23165,No.
23166,"But since we have three states with equal energies, any linear combinations of the three will also be stationary states of the same energy."
23167,The levels go as shown in Fig.
23168,19–7.
23169,The angular dependences get more complicated.
23170,The rough form of the amplitude is sketched in (e) and (f) of Fig.
23171,We will not try to describe any more of the possible states.
23172,You will find the hydrogen wave functions described in more detail in many books.
23173,"Two good references are L. Pauling and E. B. Wilson, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, McGraw-Hill (1935); and R. B. Leighton, Principles of Modern Physics, McGraw-Hill (1959)."
23174,You will find in them graphs of some of the functions and pictorial representations of many states.
23175,"That is not surprising, since it’s hard for an electron to have angular momentum when its radius arm is very small."
23176,We would like now to apply the theory of the hydrogen atom in an approximate way to get some understanding of the chemist’s periodic table of the elements.
23177,(We are again neglecting the spin of the electrons.)
23178,"No one has found an analytic solution, although solutions for the lowest energy states have been obtained by numerical methods."
23179,"It is possible, however, even with a sloppy approximation—and some fixing—to understand, at least qualitatively, many chemical properties which show up in the periodic table."
23180,The chemical properties of atoms are determined primarily by their lowest energy states.
23181,We can use the following approximate theory to find these states and their energies.
23182,"First, we neglect the electron spin, except that we adopt the exclusion principle and say that any particular electronic state can be occupied by only one electron."
23183,"This means that any particular orbital configuration can have up to two electrons—one with spin up, the other with spin down."
23184,"Next we disregard the details of the interactions between the electrons in our first approximation, and say that each electron moves in a central field which is the combined field of the nucleus and all the other electrons."
23185,In this model each electron acts like an independent particle.
23186,The angular dependence of its wave function will be just the same as the ones we had for the hydrogen atom.
23187,The energies of the states will also be somewhat different.
23188,"With these ideas, let’s see what we get."
23189,"A large ionization energy means that it is harder to pull the electron off and, in general, that the material is chemically less active."
23190,Now take helium.
23191,Both electrons can be in the same lowest state (one spin up and the other spin down).
23192,Helium is chemically inert.
23193,"The electron states will again be hydrogen-like, and the three electrons will occupy the lowest three energy levels."
23194,"In hydrogen these states have the same energy, but in other atoms they don’t, for the following reason."
23195,The energy levels will be roughly as shown in Fig.
23196,19–8—which you should compare with the corresponding diagram for hydrogen in Fig.
23197,19–7.
23198,These all have the same energy—except for some very small effects we are neglecting.
23199,This takes us to neon.
23200,Neon does not easily give up an electron.
23201,"Also there are no more low-energy slots to be filled, so it won’t try to grab an extra electron."
23202,Neon is chemically inert.
23203,"Fluorine, on the other hand, does have an empty position where an electron can drop into a state of low energy, so it is quite active in chemical reactions."
23204,The energy level of this state is much higher; the ionization energy jumps down; and sodium is an active chemical.
23205,"Angular configurations of the electrons in the outer unfilled shell have the same sequence, and the progression of ionization energies is quite similar."
23206,You can see why the chemical properties repeat with increasing atomic number.
23207,"Magnesium acts chemically much like beryllium, silicon like carbon, and chlorine like fluorine."
23208,Argon is inert like neon.
23209,"You may have noticed that there is a slight peculiarity in the sequence of ionization energies between lithium and neon, and a similar one between sodium and argon."
23210,The last electron is bound to the oxygen atom somewhat less than we might expect.
23211,And sulfur is similar.
23212,Why should that be?
23213,We can understand it if we put in just a little bit of the effects of the interactions between individual electrons.
23214,Now what will happen in carbon?
23215,"For oxygen, however, the jig is up."
23216,The fourth electron must go into one of the filled states—with opposite spin.
23217,"It is strongly repelled by the electron already in that state, so its energy will not be as low as it might otherwise be, and it is more easily removed."
23218,"That explains the break in the sequence of binding energies which appears between nitrogen and oxygen, and between phosphorus and sulfur."
23219,But they don’t.
23220,As we described earlier—and illustrated in Fig.
23221,19–8—the higher angular momentum states get pushed up in energy.
23222,"Since the outermost shell of manganese, iron, cobalt, and nickel have the same configurations, however, they all tend to have similar chemical properties."
23223,(This effect is much more pronounced in the rare-earth elements which all have the same outer shell but a progressively filling inner shell which has much less influence on their chemical properties.)
23224,"Similar things happen at other places and account for the fact that other metals, such as iron, combine chemically with either of two valences."
23225,"The outer shells, the energies, and the chemical properties repeat the pattern of boron to neon and aluminum to argon."
23226,"Krypton, like argon and neon, is known as “noble” gas."
23227,"All three are chemically “inert.” This means only that, having filled shells of relatively low energy, there are few situations in which there is an energy advantage for them to join in a simple combination with other elements."
23228,Having a filled shell is not enough.
23229,"On the other hand, krypton is not completely inert; it will form a weakly-bound compound with chlorine."
23230,We would like to bring up only one more point—that we not only can understand the valences to some extent but also can say something about the directional properties of the chemical bonds.
23231,"Each of the two hydrogens are willing to share an electron with the oxygen, helping the oxygen to fill a shell."
23232,So the water molecule should have the two hydrogen atoms making a right angle with respect to the center of the oxygen.
23233,In sharing their electrons the hydrogens end up with a net positive charge.
23234,The three hydrogens should join on at right angles to each other.
23235,And the nonflatness is what makes the ammonia maser possible.
23236,Now we see that also that shape can be understood from our quantum mechanics.
23237,The Schrödinger equation has been one of the great triumphs of physics.
23238,"By providing the key to the underlying machinery of atomic structure it has given an explanation for atomic spectra, for chemistry, and for the nature of matter."
23239,"All the things we have done so far in quantum mechanics could be handled with ordinary algebra, although we did from time to time show you some special ways of writing quantum-mechanical quantities and equations."
23240,We would like now to talk some more about some interesting and useful mathematical ways of describing quantum-mechanical things.
23241,"There are many ways of approaching the subject of quantum mechanics, and most books use a different approach from the one we have taken."
23242,As you go on to read other books you might not see right away the connections of what you will find in them to what we have been doing.
23243,"Although we will also be able to get a few useful results, the main purpose of this chapter is to tell you about some of the different ways of writing the same physics."
23244,Knowing them you should be able to understand better what other people are saying.
23245,Then someone came along and pointed out that all of the writing could be made much simpler by inventing the vector notation.
23246,It’s true that when you come down to figuring something out you often have to convert the vectors back to their components.
23247,But it’s generally much easier to see what’s going on when you work with vectors and also easier to do many of the calculations.
23248,The idea is useful because the laws of quantum mechanics can be written as algebraic equations in terms of these symbols.
23249,What does Eq.
23250,(20.2) mean?
23251,We define it this way.
23252,This is now just an algebraic equation.
23253,So Eq.
23254,(20.2) is a high-class way of writing Eq.
23255,(20.3).
23256,Actually it is a little more than that; something more is implied.
23257,In Eq.
23258,(20.2) we do not make any reference to a set of base states.
23259,Equation (20.3) is an image of Eq.
23260,(20.2) in terms of some set of base states.
23261,"But, as you know, you may use any set you wish."
23262,And this idea is implied in Eq.
23263,(20.2).
23264,The operator way of writing avoids making any particular choice.
23265,"Of course, when you want to get definite you have to choose some set."
23266,"When you make your choice, you use Eq."
23267,(20.3).
23268,So the operator equation (20.2) is a more abstract way of writing the algebraic equation (20.3).
23269,"When you want results, however, you will eventually have to give the components with respect to some set of axes."
23270,(20.2) means just the same as Eq.
23271,(20.3).
23272,(You should remember also that once you know a matrix for one particular set of base states you can always calculate the corresponding matrix that goes with any other base.
23273,You can transform the matrix from one “representation” to another.)
23274,The operator equation in (20.2) also allows a new way of thinking.
23275,Sometimes a “state” we get this way may be very peculiar—it may not represent any physical situation we are likely to encounter in nature.
23276,"(For instance, we may get a state that is not normalized to represent one electron.)"
23277,"In other words, we may at times get “states” that are mathematically artificial."
23278,"Such artificial “states” may still be useful, perhaps as the mid-point of some calculation."
23279,We have already shown you many examples of quantum-mechanical operators.
23280,It represents a “state” which is the difference of two states.
23281,One more example.
23282,They are quite different from algebraic operators which work on mathematical functions.
23283,"You can see why the same word is used in both cases, but you should keep in mind that the two kinds of operators are different."
23284,"Both kinds of operators are used in quantum mechanics and often in similar kinds of equations, as you will see a little later."
23285,When you are first learning the subject it is well to keep the distinction always in mind.
23286,"Later on, when you are more familiar with the subject, you will find that it is less important to keep any sharp distinction between the two kinds of operators."
23287,"You will, indeed, find that most books generally use the same notation for both!"
23288,We’ll go on now and look at some useful things you can do with operators.
23289,"But first, one special remark."
23290,Is there some meaning to the complex conjugate of this amplitude?
23291,"Many important operators of quantum mechanics have the special property that when you take the Hermitian adjoint, you get the same operator back."
23292,So far we have reminded you mainly of what you already know.
23293,Now we would like to discuss a new question.
23294,"How would you find the average energy of a system—say, an atom?"
23295,"Since the system does not have a definite energy, one measurement would give one energy, the same measurement on another atom in the same state would give a different energy, and so on."
23296,What would you get for the average of a whole series of energy measurements?
23297,But you may get a different number for each measurement.
23298,How are these probabilities related to the mean value of a whole sequence of energy measurements?
23299,"We continue for, say, a thousand measurements."
23300,When we are finished we add all the energies and divide by one thousand.
23301,That’s what we mean by the average.
23302,There’s also a short-cut to adding all the numbers.
23303,We are almost there.
23304,What we mean by the probability of something happening is just the number of times we expect it to happen divided by the total number of tries.
23305,A simple result.
23306,Our new formula for the average energy is not only pretty.
23307,"It is also useful, because now we don’t need to say anything about any particular set of base states."
23308,We don’t even have to know all of the possible energy levels.
23309,"Equation (20.19) can, incidentally, be extended to other physical measurements which you can express as an operator."
23310,Then all the arguments go through in the same way.
23311,We are asking for the special case of Eq.
23312,(20.19) applied to the coordinate representation.
23313,(16.50) and Eq.
23314,You can begin to see how we can go back and forth from the state-vector ideas to the wave-function ideas.
23315,The quantity in the braces of Eq.
23316,We should make one qualification on our results.
23317,Notice the similarity in form between Eq.
23318,(20.28) and Eq.
23319,(20.18).
23320,"There are, however, operators for which this is not true."
23321,For them you must work with the basic equations in (20.21) and (20.22).
23322,You can easily extend the derivation to three dimensions.
23323,With Eq.
23324,(20.30) we can calculate the average energy of an atomic state even without knowing its energy levels.
23325,All we need is the wave function.
23326,It’s an important law.
23327,We’ll tell you about one interesting application.
23328,"Suppose you want to know the ground-state energy of some system—say the helium atom, but it’s too hard to solve Schrödinger’s equation for the wave function, because there are too many variables."
23329,"Suppose, however, that you take a guess at the wave function—pick any function you like—and calculate the average energy."
23330,"That is, you use Eq."
23331,(20.29)—generalized to three dimensions-to find what the average energy would be if the atom were really in the state described by this wave function.
23332,This energy will certainly be higher than the ground-state energy which is the lowest possible energy the atom can have.3 Now pick another function and calculate its average energy.
23333,If it is lower than your first choice you are getting closer to the true ground-state energy.
23334,"If you keep on trying all sorts of artificial states you will be able to get lower and lower energies, which come closer and closer to the ground-state energy."
23335,"If you are clever, you will try some functions which have a few adjustable parameters."
23336,When you calculate the energy it will be expressed in terms of these parameters.
23337,"By varying the parameters to give the lowest possible energy, you are trying out a whole class of functions at once."
23338,Eventually you will find that it is harder and harder to get lower energies and you will begin to be convinced that you are fairly close to the lowest possible energy.
23339,"The helium atom has been solved in just this way—not by solving a differential equation, but by making up a special function with a lot of adjustable parameters which are eventually chosen to give the lowest possible value for the average energy."
23340,What is the average value of the position of an electron in an atom?
23341,What is the average?
23342,20–1.
23343,The electron is most likely to be found near the peak of the curve.
23344,"It is, in fact, just the center of gravity of the area under the curve."
23345,(20.28).
23346,(20.18).
23347,(20.34) agree with Eq.
23348,(20.33).
23349,"Now we would like to calculate the mean momentum of an electron—again, we’ll stick to one dimension."
23350,From Eq.
23351,(20.47).
23352,Now comes an interesting question.
23353,Let’s make clear what we mean.
23354,(20.46).
23355,(20.47) and proceed to evaluate the integral.
23356,"Well, let’s start by expanding Eq."
23357,"If we can find it, we can carry out the integral."
23358,We can find it in the following way.
23359,According to Eq.
23360,Suppose we start with Eq.
23361,(20.47) and again use Eq.
23362,"No, No!"
23363,That’s the whole problem.
23364,"However, some ingenious fellow discovered that the integral in (20.55) could be integrated by parts."
23365,(20.53).
23366,(20.52).
23367,(20.48) looks in the coordinate representation.
23368,Now you should begin to see an interesting pattern developing.
23369,You can easily extend the results to three dimensions.
23370,"Our general result is that for at least some quantum-mechanical operators, there are corresponding algebraic operators in the coordinate representation."
23371,We summarize our results so far—extended to three dimensions—in Table 20–1.
23372,We will now give a few illustrations of the use of these ideas.
23373,This equation is nice because it’s easy to remember if you haven’t forgotten your classical physics.
23374,This result has impressed people so much that they try to teach students all about classical physics before quantum mechanics.
23375,(We think differently!)
23376,But such parallels are often misleading.
23377,"For one thing, when you have operators, the order of various factors is important; but that is not true for the factors in a classical equation."
23378,We should show you that this is equivalent to our new definition.
23379,Let’s use this fact to show something else.
23380,(To keep things simple we’ll stick to one dimension.)
23381,"Everything holds together nicely, and many of the things we have been saying are consistent with each other."
23382,Let’s for fun look at another operation—the operation of orbital angular momentum.
23383,"That is, we want for the moment to disregard intrinsic angular momentum and think about only the orbital part."
23384,20–2.
23385,But notice.
23386,One of the fun parts of this operator business is that many classical equations get carried over into a quantum-mechanical form.
23387,Which ones don’t?
23388,"There had better be some that don’t come out right, because if everything did, then there would be nothing different about quantum mechanics."
23389,There would be no new physics.
23390,Here is one equation which is different.
23391,There is another very important commutation rule that has to do with angular momenta.
23392,It is interesting to notice that operators which do not commute can also occur in classical physics.
23393,We have already seen this when we have talked about rotation in space.
23394,"It is, in fact, just this property of space that is responsible for Eq."
23395,(20.75).
23396,Now we want to show you something else.
23397,How do averages change with time?
23398,Why should it?
23399,Certainly the average position of a particle could be moving.
23400,How does such a motion come out of Eq.
23401,"First, we know that the rate of change of a state is given by the Hamiltonian."
23402,(20.76).
23403,Let us try out Eq.
23404,(20.82) on some example to see whether it really makes sense.
23405,Exactly like classical mechanics.
23406,Another example.
23407,What is the rate of change of the average momentum of a state?
23408,Same game.
23409,"The right-hand side is the force, so we have derived Newton’s law!"
23410,But remember—these are the laws for the operators which give the average quantities.
23411,They do not describe what goes on in detail inside an atom.
23412,The history of this idea is also interesting.
23413,"Within a period of a few months in 1926, Heisenberg and Schrödinger independently found correct laws to describe atomic mechanics."
23414,"In our language he was using the energy-representation, with its matrices."
23415,Both Heisenberg’s matrix algebra and Schrödinger’s differential equation explained the hydrogen atom.
23416,A few months later Schrödinger was able to show that the two theories were equivalent—as we have seen here.
23417,But the two different mathematical forms of quantum mechanics were discovered independently.
23418,(There was no summary for this lecture.)
23419,This lecture is only for entertainment.
23420,"I would like to give the
lecture in a somewhat different style—just to see how it works
out."
23421,"It’s not a part of the course—in the sense that it is not
supposed to be a last minute effort to teach you something new."
23422,"But,
rather, I imagine that I’m giving a seminar or research report on the
subject to a more advanced audience, to people who have already been
educated in quantum mechanics."
23423,"The main difference between a seminar
and a regular lecture is that the seminar speaker does not carry out
all the steps, or all the algebra."
23424,"He says: “If you do such and such,
this is what comes out,” instead of showing all of the details."
23425,"So in
this lecture I’ll describe the ideas all the way along but just give
you the results of the computations."
23426,"You should realize that
you’re not supposed to understand everything immediately, but believe
(more or less) that things would come out if you went through the
steps."
23427,"All that aside, this is a subject I want to talk about."
23428,"It is
recent and modern and would be a perfectly legitimate talk to give at
a research seminar."
23429,"My subject is the Schrödinger equation in a
classical setting—the case of superconductivity."
23430,"Ordinarily, the wave function which appears in the Schrödinger
equation applies to only one or two particles."
23431,"And the wave function
itself is not something that has a classical meaning—unlike the
electric field, or the vector potential, or things of that kind."
23432,"The
wave function for a single particle is a “field”—in the
sense that it is a function of position—but it does not generally
have a classical significance."
23433,"Nevertheless, there are some situations
in which a quantum mechanical wave function does have classical
significance, and they are the ones I would like to take up."
23434,"The
peculiar quantum mechanical behavior of matter on a small scale
doesn’t usually make itself felt on a large scale except in the
standard way that it produces Newton’s laws—the laws of the
so-called classical mechanics."
23435,"But there are certain situations in
which the peculiarities of quantum mechanics can come out in a special
way on a large scale."
23436,"At low temperatures, when the energy of a system has been reduced
very, very low, instead of a large number of states being involved,
only a very, very small number of states near the ground state are
involved."
23437,"Under those circumstances the quantum mechanical character
of that ground state can appear on a macroscopic scale."
23438,"It is the
purpose of this lecture to show a connection between quantum mechanics
and large-scale effects—not the usual discussion of the way that
quantum mechanics reproduces Newtonian mechanics on the average, but a
special situation in which quantum mechanics will produce its own
characteristic effects on a large or “macroscopic” scale."
23439,"I will begin by reminding you of some of the properties of the
Schrödinger equation.1 I want to describe the behavior of a particle
in a magnetic field using the Schrödinger equation, because the
superconductive phenomena are involved with magnetic fields."
23440,"An
external magnetic field is described by a vector potential, and the
problem is: what are the laws of quantum mechanics in a vector
potential?"
23441,"The principle that describes the behavior of quantum
mechanics in a vector potential is very simple."
23442,"The amplitude that a
particle goes from one place to another along a certain route when
there’s a field present is the same as the amplitude that it would go
along the same route when there’s no field, multiplied by the
exponential of the line integral of the vector potential, times the
electric charge divided by
Planck’s constant2 (see Fig."
23443,There are three pieces.
23444,"However, in doing so in a vector
potential, the phase of the amplitude must be shifted according to the
rule in Eq."
23445,(21.1).
23446,"Since the
electron is jumping backwards, I showed this phase shift with a minus
sign."
23447,That gives the second piece.
23448,That gives the third piece.
23449,"(21.4) will approach the behavior of an electron in
free space."
23450,Now this horrible combination of things looks quite complicated.
23451,"(21.6) is the same as the first
part of Eq."
23452,(21.3).
23453,"(The origin of the potential energy
term is well known, so I haven’t bothered to include it in this
discussion.)"
23454,The proposition of Eq.
23455,Now I turn to a second point.
23456,"An important part of the Schrödinger
equation for a single particle is the idea that the probability to
find the particle at a position is given by the absolute square of the
wave function."
23457,"It is also characteristic of the quantum mechanics that
probability is conserved in a local sense."
23458,"When the probability of
finding the electron somewhere decreases, while the probability of the
electron being elsewhere increases (keeping the total probability
unchanged), something must be going on in between."
23459,"In other words, the
electron has a continuity in the sense that if the probability
decreases at one place and builds up at another place, there must be
some kind of flow between."
23460,"If you put a wall, for example, in the way,
it will have an influence and the probabilities will not be the
same."
23461,"So the conservation of probability alone is not the complete
statement of the conservation law, just as the conservation of energy
alone is not as deep and important as the local conservation of
energy.6 If energy
is disappearing, there must be a flow of energy to correspond."
23462,"In the
same way, we would like to find a “current” of probability such that
if there is any change in the probability density (the probability of
being found in a unit volume), it can be considered as coming from an
inflow or an outflow due to some current."
23463,Is there such a current?
23464,"And it turns
out that what is left can indeed be written as a perfect
divergence."
23465,"It is
some quantity plus its own complex conjugate, so the whole thing is
real—as it ought to be."
23466,"I could
write the current in Eq."
23467,(21.8).
23468,"Equation (21.11) shows that the probability is conserved
locally."
23469,"If a particle disappears from one region it cannot appear in
another without something going on in between."
23470,"Imagine that the first
region is surrounded by a closed surface far enough out that there is
zero probability to find the electron at the surface."
23471,"Only if some of the probability approaches the boundary
can some of it leak out."
23472,"We can say that it only gets out by moving
through the surface—and that is local conservation."
23473,"The equation for the current is rather interesting, and sometimes
causes a certain amount of worry."
23474,"You would think the current would be
something like the density of particles times the velocity."
23475,"And
each term in Eq."
23476,"The two possibilities differ by
the vector potential."
23477,"I’d like to make a brief digression to show you what this is all
about—why there must be something like Eq."
23478,"(21.15) in
the quantum mechanics."
23479,"The wave function changes with time according
to the Schrödinger equation in Eq."
23480,(21.3).
23481,"If I would
suddenly change the vector potential, the wave function wouldn’t
change at the first instant; only its rate of change changes."
23482,"Now
think of what would happen in the following circumstance."
23483,21–2.
23484,"And there is a charged
particle sitting nearby."
23485,"Suppose this flux nearly instantaneously
builds up from zero to something."
23486,"I start with zero vector potential
and then I turn on a vector potential."
23487,"So the
gradient is also unchanged."
23488,"But remember what happens electrically when I suddenly turn on a
flux."
23489,"When Schrödinger first
discovered his equation he discovered the conservation law of
Eq."
23490,(21.8) as a consequence of his equation.
23491,"He
soon found on doing a number of problems that it didn’t work out quite
right."
23492,"It was at this point that Born
made an essential contribution to our ideas regarding quantum mechanics."
23493,"That whole idea is due
to Born."
23494,"The electron is either here, or there, or somewhere else, but
wherever it is, it is a point charge."
23495,"On the other hand, think of a
situation in which there are an enormous number of particles in
exactly the same state, a very large number of them with exactly the
same wave function."
23496,Then what?
23497,"So in the situation in which we can have very many particles in
exactly the same state, there is possible a new physical
interpretation of the wave functions."
23498,"The charge density and the
electric current can be calculated directly from the wave functions
and the wave functions take on a physical meaning which extends into
classical, macroscopic situations."
23499,Something similar can happen with neutral particles.
23500,"When we have the
wave function of a single photon, it is the amplitude to find a photon
somewhere."
23501,"Although we haven’t ever written it down there is an
equation for the photon wave function analogous to the Schrödinger
equation for the electron."
23502,"The wave
function turns out to be just the vector potential."
23503,"The quantum
physics is the same thing as the classical physics because photons are
noninteracting Bose particles and many of them can be in the same
state—as you know, they like to be in the same state."
23504,"The
moment that you have billions in the same state (that is, in the same
electromagnetic wave), you can measure the wave function, which is the
vector potential, directly."
23505,"Of course, it worked historically the
other way."
23506,"The first observations were on situations with many photons
in the same state, and so we were able to discover the correct
equation for a single photon by observing directly with our hands on a
macroscopic level the nature of the wave function."
23507,"Now the trouble with the electron is that you cannot put more than one
in the same state."
23508,"Therefore, it was long believed that the wave
function of the Schrödinger equation would never have a macroscopic
representation analogous to the macroscopic representation of the
amplitude for photons."
23509,"On the other hand, it is now realized that the
phenomenon of superconductivity presents us with just this situation."
23510,"As you know, very many metals become superconducting below a certain
temperature9—the temperature is different for different metals."
23511,"When you
reduce the temperature sufficiently the metals conduct electricity
without any resistance."
23512,"This phenomenon has been observed for a very
large number of metals but not for all, and the theory of this
phenomenon has caused a great deal of difficulty."
23513,"It took a very long
time to understand what was going on inside of superconductors, and I
will only describe enough of it for our present purposes."
23514,"It turns out
that due to the interactions of the electrons with the vibrations of the
atoms in the lattice, there is a small net effective attraction
between the electrons."
23515,"The result is that the electrons form together,
if I may speak very qualitatively and crudely, bound pairs."
23516,Now you know that a single electron is a Fermi particle.
23517,"But a bound
pair would act as a Bose particle, because if I exchange both
electrons in a pair I change the sign of the wave function twice, and
that means that I don’t change anything."
23518,"A pair is a Bose
particle."
23519,"The energy of pairing—that is, the net attraction—is very, very
weak."
23520,"Only a tiny temperature is needed to throw the electrons apart
by thermal agitation, and convert them back to “normal”
electrons."
23521,"But when you make the temperature sufficiently low that
they have to do their very best to get into the absolutely lowest
state; then they do collect in pairs."
23522,"I don’t wish you to imagine that the pairs are really held together very
closely like a point particle."
23523,"As a matter of fact, one of the great
difficulties of understanding this phenomenon originally was that that is
not the way things are."
23524,"The two electrons which form the pair are really
spread over a considerable distance; and the mean distance between pairs
is relatively smaller than the size of a single pair."
23525,"Several pairs are
occupying the same space at the same time."
23526,"Both the reason why electrons
in a metal form pairs and an estimate of the energy given up in forming
a pair have been a triumph of recent times."
23527,"This fundamental point in
the theory of superconductivity was first explained in the theory of
Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer,10 but that is not the subject of
this seminar."
23528,"We will accept, however, the idea that the electrons do,
in some manner or other, work in pairs, that we can think of these pairs
as behaving more or less like particles, and that we can therefore talk
about the wave function for a “pair.”"
23529,"Now the Schrödinger equation for the pair will be more or less like
Eq."
23530,(21.3).
23531,"Nor should we
think that if we go to very high frequencies (or short wavelengths),
this is exactly the right form, because the kinetic energy that
corresponds to very rapidly varying wave functions may be so great as
to break up the pairs."
23532,"At finite temperatures there are always a few
pairs which are broken up according to the usual Boltzmann theory."
23533,"The electrons that are not bound in pairs
are called “normal” electrons and will move around in the crystal in
the ordinary way."
23534,"I will, however, consider only the situation at
essentially zero temperature—or, in any case, I will disregard the
complications produced by those electrons which are not in pairs."
23535,"Since electron pairs are bosons, when there are a lot of them in a
given state there is an especially large amplitude for other pairs to
go to the same state."
23536,"So nearly all of the pairs will be locked down
at the lowest energy in exactly the same state—it won’t be
easy to get one of them into another state."
23537,"So we would expect all the pairs to be moving in the same
state."
23538,What then will our theory look like?
23539,"(Any complex
function can, of course, be written this way.)"
23540,"The absolute
phase is not observable, but if the gradient of the phase is known
everywhere, the phase is known except for a constant."
23541,"You can define
the phase at one point, and then the phase everywhere is determined."
23542,Now we can describe some of the phenomena of superconductivity.
23543,"First,
there is no electrical resistance."
23544,"There’s no resistance because all
the electrons are collectively in the same state."
23545,"In the ordinary flow
of current you knock one electron or the other out of the regular
flow, gradually deteriorating the general momentum."
23546,"But here to get
one electron away from what all the others are doing is very hard
because of the tendency of all Bose particles to go in the same
state."
23547,"A current once started, just keeps on going forever."
23548,"It’s also easy to understand that if you have a piece of metal in the
superconducting state and turn on a magnetic field which isn’t too
strong (we won’t go into the details of how strong), the magnetic
field can’t penetrate the metal."
23549,"If, as you build up the magnetic
field, any of it were to build up inside the metal, there would be a
rate of change of flux which would produce an electric field, and an
electric field would immediately generate a current which, by Lenz’s
law, would oppose the flux."
23550,"Since all the electrons will move
together, an infinitesimal electric field will generate enough current
to oppose completely any applied magnetic field."
23551,"So if you turn the
field on after you’ve cooled a metal to the superconducting state, it
will be excluded."
23552,"Even more interesting is a related phenomenon discovered experimentally
by Meissner.11 If you have a piece
of the metal at a high temperature (so that it is a normal conductor)
and establish a magnetic field through it, and then you lower the
temperature below the critical temperature (where the metal becomes a
superconductor), the field is expelled."
23553,"In other words, it starts
up its own current—and in just the right amount to push the field out."
23554,"We can see the reason for that in the equations, and I’d like to
explain how."
23555,"Suppose that we take a piece of superconducting material
which is in one lump."
23556,"Then in a steady situation of any kind the
divergence of the current must be zero because there’s no place for it
to go."
23557,"(I should explain why choosing this convention doesn’t
mean any loss of generality, but I don’t want to take the time.)"
23558,Taking the divergence of Eq.
23559,One moment.
23560,I forgot to mention an important point.
23561,"There is
a background of positive charge in this metal due to the atomic ions
of the lattice."
23562,Now we can use Eq.
23563,"(21.20) in the equations of
electromagnetism to solve for the fields."
23564,"For example, in one dimension Eq."
23565,"These solutions mean that the vector potential must
decrease exponentially as you go from the surface into the
material."
23566,(It can’t increase because there would be a blow up.)
23567,"The entire remainder of the interior is free of field,
as sketched in Fig."
23568,21–3.
23569,"This is the explanation of the Meissner
effect."
23570,"That gives you the
order of magnitude."
23571,"The London equation (21.21) was proposed to account for
the observed facts of superconductivity including the
Meissner effect."
23572,"In recent times, however, there have been some even more
dramatic predictions."
23573,"One prediction made by London was so peculiar
that nobody paid much attention to it until recently."
23574,"I will now
discuss it."
23575,"The sequence of
events is sketched in Fig."
23576,21–4.
23577,"In the normal state there will be a
field in the body of the ring as sketched in part (a) of the
figure."
23578,"When the ring is made superconducting, the field is forced
outside of the material (as we have just seen)."
23579,"There will then
be some flux through the hole of the ring as sketched in part (b)."
23580,"If
the external field is now removed, the lines of field going through
the hole are “trapped” as shown in part (c)."
23581,"As the external field is removed a super current
starts flowing around the ring to keep the flux through the ring a
constant."
23582,"(It’s the old eddy-current idea, only with zero resistance.)"
23583,"These currents can keep the magnetic field
out of the body of the ring, and produce the permanently trapped
magnetic field as well."
23584,"Now, however, there is an essential difference, and our equations
predict a surprising effect."
23585,21–5.
23586,From Eq.
23587,"(21.28) would
be zero."
23588,"That would be true for a closed loop in a simply-connected
piece of superconductor, but it is not necessarily true for a
ring-shaped piece."
23589,"The only physical requirement we can make is that
there can be only one value of the wave function for each
point."
23590,"So if we make one complete turn around the ring the left-hand
side of Eq."
23591,"Using
Eq."
23592,"If you would think of the ring as a classical object with an ideally
perfect (that is, infinite) conductivity, you would think that
whatever flux was initially found through it would just stay
there—any amount of flux at all could be trapped."
23593,"It must be a multiple of a basic quantum
mechanical unit."
23594,"London14 predicted that the
flux trapped by a superconducting ring would be quantized and said
that the possible values of the flux would be given by
Eq."
23595,"To
visualize such a flux, think of a tiny cylinder a tenth of a millimeter
in diameter; the magnetic field inside it when it contains this amount
of flux is about one percent of the earth’s magnetic field."
23596,"It should be
possible to observe such a flux by a sensitive magnetic measurement."
23597,"In 1961 such a quantized flux was looked for and found by Deaver and
Fairbank15 at
Stanford University and at about the same time by Doll and
Näbauer16 in
Germany."
23598,"In the experiment of Deaver and Fairbank, a tiny cylinder of
superconductor was made by electroplating a thin layer of tin on a
one-centimeter length of No."
23599,"The wire was put in a small
controlled magnetic field, and the temperature reduced until the tin
became superconducting."
23600,"Then the external source of field was
removed."
23601,"You would expect this to generate a current by Lenz’s law so
that the flux inside would not change."
23602,"The little cylinder should now
have magnetic moment proportional to the flux inside."
23603,"The
induced voltage in the coils was then a measure of the magnetic
moment."
23604,"When the experiment was done by Deaver and Fairbank, they found that
the flux was quantized, but that the basic unit was only
one-half as large as London had predicted."
23605,"Doll and Näbauer got the
same result."
23606,"At first this was quite mysterious,17 but
we now understand why it should be so."
23607,"Everything now fits
together, and the measurements show the existence of the predicted
purely quantum-mechanical effect on a large scale."
23608,"The Meissner effect
and the flux quantization are two confirmations of
our general ideas."
23609,"Just for the sake of completeness I would like to
show you what the complete equations of a superconducting fluid would
be from this point of view—it is rather interesting."
23610,"So we substitute the wave function of
Eq."
23611,"If we separate real and
imaginary parts we obtain then two equations."
23612,"To write them in a shorter
form I will—following Eq."
23613,"For those who are not so familiar with the equations of hydrodynamics,
I can rewrite Eq."
23614,"(21.33) in a form that makes the
physics more apparent by using Eq."
23615,"Taking the gradient of the whole of
Eq."
23616,(21.34).
23617,"Taking it to the left side, I can write
Eq."
23618,"These two equations are the equations of motion of the superconducting
electron fluid."
23619,"The first equation is just Newton’s law for a charged
fluid in an electromagnetic field."
23620,"That means that the velocity can be
expressed in terms of velocity potential."
23621,(21.39).
23622,"So, Schrödinger’s equation for the electron pairs in a superconductor
gives us the equations of motion of an electrically charged ideal fluid."
23623,"Superconductivity is the same as the problem of the hydrodynamics of a
charged liquid."
23624,"If you want to solve any problem about superconductors
you take these equations for the fluid [or the equivalent pair,
Eqs."
23625,"(21.32) and (21.33)], and combine
them with Maxwell’s equations to get the fields."
23626,"(The charges
and currents you use to get the fields must, of course, include the ones
from the superconductor as well as from the external sources.)"
23627,"Incidentally, I believe that Eq."
23628,"(21.38) is not quite
correct, but ought to have an additional term involving the
density."
23629,"This new term does not depend on quantum mechanics, but comes
from the ordinary energy associated with variations of density."
23630,"Since there will be forces
proportional to the gradient of this energy, there should be another
term in Eq."
23631,"This term did not appear
from the analysis because it comes from the interactions between
particles, which I neglected in using an independent-particle
approximation."
23632,"I would like to discuss next a very interesting situation that was
noticed by
Josephson19 while analyzing what might happen at
a junction between two superconductors."
23633,"Suppose we have two
superconductors which are connected by a thin layer of insulating
material as in Fig."
23634,21–6.
23635,"Such an arrangement is now called a
“Josephson junction.” If the insulating layer is thick, the
electrons can’t get through; but if the layer is thin enough, there
can be an appreciable quantum mechanical amplitude for electrons to
jump across."
23636,"This is just another example of the quantum-mechanical
penetration of a barrier."
23637,"Josephson analyzed this
situation and discovered that a number of strange phenomena should
occur."
23638,"I could
do this problem for different kinds of superconductors, but let us
take a very simple situation in which the material is the same on both
sides so that the junction is symmetrical and simple."
23639,"Also, for a
moment let there be no magnetic field."
23640,"(It is just the “flip-flop”
amplitude of a two-state system.)"
23641,"These are the standard equations for two quantum mechanical states
coupled together."
23642,"This time, let’s analyze these equations in another
way."
23643,These equations are not the whole story.
23644,"They tell how the
densities would start to change, and therefore describe the
kind of current that would begin to flow."
23645,"These currents from the battery have not been included in
our equations."
23646,(21.44).
23647,In Eqs.
23648,"(21.45) and (21.47) we have an important
result, the general theory of the Josephson junction."
23649,Now what are the consequences?
23650,"First, put on a dc voltage."
23651,"(In practice, since the
temperature is not zero, you would get a small current due to the
conduction by “normal” electrons.)"
23652,"On the other hand if you have
zero voltage across the junction, you can get a current!"
23653,"But try to put a voltage across
it and the current goes to zero."
23654,"This strange behavior has recently been
observed experimentally.20"
23655,"There is another way of getting a current—by applying a voltage at a
very high frequency in addition to a dc voltage."
23656,"Shapiro21 claims to have observed such a
resonance effect."
23657,"The reason for
this is that when there’s a vector potential across the junction the
flip-flop amplitude is modified in phase in the way that we explained
earlier."
23658,"If you chase that extra phase through, it comes out as given
above."
23659,"Finally, I would like to describe a very dramatic and interesting
experiment which has recently been made on the interference of the
currents from each of two junctions."
23660,"In quantum mechanics we’re used to
the interference between amplitudes from two different slits."
23661,"Now we’re
going to do the interference between two junctions caused by the
difference in the phase of the arrival of the currents through two
different paths."
23662,In Fig.
23663,"21–7, I show two different
junctions, “a” and “b”, connected in parallel."
23664,(21.26).
23665,"21–7
which circles through both junctions."
23666,"In particular,
it will depend on the external voltage we apply to the junction."
23667,"That is to say that the current takes on its
maximum values where the flux linkage has just those quantized values
we found in Eq."
23668,(21.30)!
23669,"The Josephson current through a double junction was recently
measured22 as a
function of the magnetic field in the area between the junctions."
23670,"The
results are shown in Fig."
23671,21–8.
23672,(21.52).
23673,"Yet it is reported that the amount of
current depends oscillatorily on the flux of magnetic field inside that
solenoid even though that field never touches the wires—another
demonstration of the “physical reality” of the vector
potential.24"
23674,I don’t know what will come next.
23675,But look what can be done.
23676,"First,
notice that the interference between two junctions can be used to make
a sensitive magnetometer."
23677,"One should be able to go even
further."
23678,"Perhaps we can predict that the
measurement of magnetic fields will—by using the effects of
quantum-mechanical interference—eventually become almost as precise as
the measurement of wavelength of light."
23679,"These then are some illustrations of things that are happening in
modern times—the transistor, the laser, and now these junctions,
whose ultimate practical applications are still not known."
23680,"The quantum
mechanics which was discovered in 1926 has had nearly 40 years of
development, and rather suddenly it has begun to be exploited in many
practical and real ways."
23681,"We are really getting control of nature on a
very delicate and beautiful level."
23682,"I am sorry to say, gentlemen, that to participate in this adventure it
is absolutely imperative that you learn quantum mechanics as soon as
possible."
23683,"It was our hope that in this course we would find a way to
make comprehensible to you at the earliest possible moment the
mysteries of this part of physics."
