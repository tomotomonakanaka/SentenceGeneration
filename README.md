# Feynman Like Sentence Generator
This is the Final Project in the lecture, Physics129L at UCSB.  
I make the models that generate the sentences like Feynman Lectures.
## Set Up
```
$ pip instal -r requirements.txt
$ python
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('punkt')
>>> exit()
$ python MakeCSV.py
```

## Markov Chain
Run
```
$ python run_markov.py
```
When you are asked to type a first word for generating a sentence, you have to write this word in the lower case.  
The example result is below.

```
:~/SentenceGeneration$ python run_markov.py

i e quantities involving components which are not true for any quantum mechanical view when the optic axis the long run if the particles do not know all the charges are moving they will be found outside of the butadiene molecule according to quantum mechanics however that only works when the elements on the direction of motion for the states agrees with eq.

you do anything now we learn that these sources must supply to the last term in the laboratory with a hydrogen atom it acts through a small displacement that is almost exactly the same direction even with a wide range one has yet formulated a successful experiment we find that forces have one electron doesn t matter if everybody says ooh a rainbow if we permit the escape will be the sum over all pairs of electrons is so interesting is the one at the same way as to location and spin down and then you will have a new layer get started however we are not self evident that it is not of much weight it sets into a spray of fine grained enormously strongly interacting plus and minus signs come from the special theory to agree with the fields only or in graduate school too.

## LSTM Language Model
Run
```
$ python run_LSTM.py
```
It requires long time to train this model, so
Using GPU is recommended.  
The example result is below.
```
~/SentenceGeneration$ python run_LSTM.py
